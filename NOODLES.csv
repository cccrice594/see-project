review
"During a business trip late last summer, we dined at Noodles in the Bellagio and were more than pleasantly surprised. From outside appearances, our expectations were actually quite low.  Here is yet another valuable lesson in not judging books by their cover. After a short wait for seating, we received extremely courteous service and exemplary authentic Asian Rim food made fresh to order; none of that prefabricated Americanized stuff. We’ve enjoyed some stellar Asian cuisine around the country, especially in several different China Towns over the years. This food at Noodles was actually comparable, and in some ways better. Our next trip to Vegas will definitely include another delicious meal at Noodles."
"Located inside Bellagio Hotel in Vegas, this restaurant has a nice ambience and it's suitable for family dining. Though it was a long line up and wait time to get a table as reservations can't be made, the service was great and fast. My son who's very particular and picky about food, enjoyed the noodles and dumplings. Most nice restaurants in Ceaser's Palace and Bellagio close at 10, but this opens until late."
"In a city where a cocktail can cost $20 it's to find a spot that isn't trying to gauge your wallet. My friend and I shared the $30 price fix meal at Nooles and with a choice of soup, appetizer and entree, it was plenty for both. The small restaurant is lovely and quiet and the food was delicious. I can imagine there might be a lengthy wait during busy travel times but we only waited a few minutes."
The beef noodle dish really was tasteless. The shrimp pad thai was good. Tables very close together - so much so that when the table next to us was served I got bumped on 3 separate occasions by the waitress. Cant have a conversation with out the table both sides hearing. It needs 1 less table on the 2 seaters and more space. Really disappointed with the taste of the food.
"The Bellagio is host to some very impressive restaurants with some very expensive bill tabs, but Noodles is a great little restaurant near the casino entrance. The staff are friendly and efficient. The menu has plenty to choose from and the food is delicious."
"We stayed in another hotel but was at this casino to play lots and ran into Noodles on accident.  Good option of Asian food available and the food was amazing.  We had an order or fried pot stickers, mini egg rolls, Thai iced tea, and friend chicken rice.  Everything was delicious and far too much food for my husband and I to finish ourselves.  We were in Vegas for 4 1/2 days a date there twice because it was so good!  Beware, pricey but everything on the strip is 50-75 dollars for a two person meal."
"We stayed in the Bellagio and only for the one night, so we picked a restaurant there that would be good for the whole family.  Noodles is what we chose and what a mistake that was.  The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is that some of the food at our table was pretty good like the Hong Kong noodles and my daughter's shrimp wonton soup.  I ordered Malaysian fried rice and it was not different than regular fried rice and didn't seem to be what the menu described.  I am pretty sure I was given regular fried rice.  The service was absolutely awful.  The main problem is that I felt we were at a cafeteria ordering food.  We placed our orders to include 3 different appetizers, and then 4 meals (one for each of us).  However, we received 1 appetizer and then immediately following, 2 of the 4 meals.  We were a bit confused.  We were hungry so we just started with the appetizer.  We would have just told our waited to forget the other two appetizers at that point, but we literally didn't see him for like 15 minutes when he brought out the two remaining appetizers and 1 of our other meals.  We asked at that point where the 4th meal was and he said it was on its way.  Likely another 10 minutes transpired and then my daughter received her food.  We were all pretty much done at that point. The waiter was basically never seen and didn't seem to care that our food was totally messed up.  I was just completely appalled.  They were not overly busy in any way.  The assistant was awesome in always keeping our drinks filled.  But for a $160 check, I would have rather just had fast food in our room."
"We've been eating at Noodles for many years and even during a global pandemic, they do not disappoint! Their food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. The staff are always extremely polite and welcoming. This is a must-do for us anytime we are staying in Vegas or even passing through."
"They have the advantage of being one of the only places open during the week at Bellagio.  With almost everything closed during the week, they have a monopoly on the joint!

This monopoly hasn't affected the quality of the food though.  The service can be hit or miss, we went twice on our last stay, service was great one time and horrible the other. 

They have a great variety of noodle dishes, as well as other common favorites.  The Pho and Beef Satay were excellent.  Don't be afraid to order a cocktail while you are there, they are mad at the bar located just outside the restaurant.  I can take a bit of time to get them though!!

All in all, I'd certainly go back if I was staying in the hotel, but not a place I'd make a dedicated trip to.  Too many other great options in Vegas for noodles."
"On our recent visit to Las Vegas, we had the pleasure of dining at Noodles Restaurant at the Bellagio.

For dinner on November 6, 2023, and November 7, 2023 we made reservations.  Both times we were seated immediately.  On November 9, 2023 for lunch, we did not have reservations but were seated immediately.

Each time we had a table that was convenient for a wheelchair.

Staff were friendly and professional.  They gave us an appropriate amount of time to review the menu, and were available to answer questions.  The service, on all three of our visits, was impeccable.

Our food was perfect.  The presentation was pleasing.  The temperature was perfect.  The spicing was to our taste.

We recommend each of the dishes we had.  Mongolian beef, Pad Thai barbecue pork, Pad Thai beef, Hor Fun black bean sauce chicken, Yaki Udon barbecue pork, and Yaki Udon beef.

The pricing was reasonable for the quality of the food, portion size, service, location and ambiance."
"We used to go here years ago and loved this place. We stopped by couple of days ago during our Christmas vacation, and it  was a completely disappointed.
The server was so rude and the service was so bad. This restaurant is charging premium for food that tastes was so terrible.  Please stay away with dishes that we ordered.
1. Dory fillet with ginger and onions
* This one is so salty, greasy and smelt so bad. And its cost  $32.88 

2. XO CRABMEAT VERMICELLI
* Vermicelli was so dry and no taste. There was a tiny crabmeat in this dish that they called XO CRABMEAT. This one cost $30.88

My suggestion for you is stay away with this restaurant.
Expensive, Greasy (need to say it few times), taste meh, terrible customer service."
wife and I had a snack one night and liked it very much. The place was packed. We order a simple beef and flat noodles dish and shared it. My wife is not a huge asian good fan and loved it.
"What a disappointment.  I thought the Bellagio would have higher standards.  We ordered the egg rolls, Malaysian roti with curry sauce and chow Fun noodles with beef in oyster sauce.   For the egg rolls they could have come out  of any freezer case from a grocery store.  There was nothing distinctive about the filling or flavor.  The roti was a bit oily however the sauce was not Malaysian.  For one thing, for Malaysian food the curry is supposed to be yellow, not the orange colored.  It was gritty and nothing like Malaysian.  The chow fun the noodles were stuck together in big wads.  Clearly the chef did not separate them before the hot water.  For a restaurant named noodles, they were very sad.  I don't know what oyster sauce they used but it was of the lowest quality and totally lacking in flavor.  No amount of hot or soy sauce could save it.  When they waiter asked how the dinner was we told him the above and he took the chow fun off our bill.  Sadly, overall, Panda Express could kick their asses.  Don't eat here."
"the food is okay, nothing special. but we experienced the rudest bartender i’ve ever come across unfortunately. our server was so lovely but wow i can’t believe they have someone working there who is that offensive! our server even told us that he was a problem! super disappointing, thankfully i live in canada and rarely have to deal with people like that so that’s why it stuck out to my friends and i so much on our trip. would skip this place honestly, there are so many amazing restaurants in vegas, if you went to panda express you would basically have the same experience."
"We ordered the duck, broccoli with oyster sauce, crispy orange chicken and pork fried rice.  The meal was served hot and was good - not great.  The tables are close and it is noisy.  The service was good."
"I decided to try this restaurant for take away since I was staying at the Bellagio. Firstly, the hostess seemed visibly overwhelmed and stressed out so she was a bit frazzled and short when speaking with customers (maybe she is inexperienced with working at a busy restaurant?). I was excited to try the food, but was left disappointed when I started to eat and found that the chicken wings and oriental rice were EXTREMELY salty. I wasn’t expecting that at all; and I’m definitely someone who appreciates flavored food. However, the over salty taste made it very difficult to enjoy the meal. I was quiet disappointed and really wish the food was prepared better."
"I have been eating here for 20 years. it's no longer any good. The food is very dumbed down now and the prices are crazy high. if you order take out they give you one cheap set of plastic silverware even if you order for 8 people. They won't even provide soy sauce.
Very cheap quality--very high prices!"
"Lovely restaurant right off the casino floor at the Bellagio. Large menu, yet each item is distinct and carefully chosen. We ordered a large variety of appetizers and entrees and every dish was delicious. The servers are also quite kind and patient when you ask questions. As a bonus, there is a great cocktail menu. Don’t miss this!
The restaurant is very pretty and serene, yet buzzing at the same time.
I would return in a heartbeat!"
"The first night I had a waitress make me up a dish that was just plain sauce, beef, and vegetables. It was delish. The second night I ordered the confusing Kung poa dish with different meat that you could choose.  It was a dried up salty nasty mess. First dish delicious, second dish disgusting. Worse than old food court food."
"One remarkable exception to the polished hospitality offerings throughout the Bellagio Hotel in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, Noodles is clearly a ""miss"". Just off the main gaming floor it offers a wide variety of  asian dishes at reasonable (even for Vegas) prices. 

 We had a dinner reservation and were seated immediately in the midst of a brightly lit, hurry/scurry atmosphere. The table top was filthy. It obviously had not been serviced since the previous customer departed. We called this to the attention of the host who immediately summoned a bus boy to clean it. Instead we opted to be reseated across the aisle, and were accommodated immediately.

 Upon making the move we both encountered a sticky linoleum floor, which further added to our concern. And that table top, too, was filthy.  A  customer at an adjoining table opined that they also had exactly the same experience.

We decided that the front of the house issues could well portend a similarly unacceptable scenario in the  kitchen etc.  We left. So we offer no commentary on the food or service. We didn't stay nor will we be back."
"We stopped at Noodles for an early lunch during our recent stay at the Bellagio. The restaurant offers a very large selection of Asian noodle dishes. We started our meal with the vegetable tempura appetizer. It was cooked well and was a good start to the meal. I ordered the Spicy Thai Shrimp soup and my son ordered the Noodle soup with soya chicken. Both soups were enjoyable and were definitely a full meal. The Thai soup was flavorful, spicy and loaded with noodles. 

The restaurant is quite small but is very nice. I would probably recommend making a reservation if you want to eat here. The prices were reasonable and the service was efficient and polite. I would recommend this restaurant for a casual meal and we will definitely be returning to try some of the other offerings on the menu."
"Decided to eat here during lunch since we were staying at the Bellagio. We were seated pretty quick and the seats were nice. We ordered the dumplings for an app and that tasted great. Wife ordered some noodle dish that was heavily coated with oil and sauce which I thought tasted amazing but was too filling for her. I had a seafood noodle soup that was insanely disappointing. There was probably no flavor at all for either the seafood or soup. 

Overall the service, seating, and atmosphere were nice but the food was just ok."
"We were beginning to despair of getting reasonable food at midrange prices in Las Vegas, until we found Noodles. Wonton soup maybe best I have had in hundreds of restaurants around the world. Portions are big. Returned next day, so we also tried Ramen and Singapore noodles. Both very decent. But Wonton Soup is memorable, hugh shrimp inside, nothing else."
"I have eaten at Noodles many many times over the past 25 years.  It is the place I go for Chinese comfort food - partially because I almost always stay at Bellagio (if I stayed at Wynn then Red 8 is equally good but somewhat different).  I could count on Noodles for consistently and my favorite dishes are its Cantonese Chow Mein (their noodles are totally unique - no other place has that great texture)and their Mandarin beef noodle soup (the best!).   I would given Noodles a 5 star rating in the more than 50 times I've eaten there over my lifetime.   And maybe it is unfair I am writing a review only after a ""not good"" experience.  But I was so unsatisfied with my lunch I had to pint it out.  Lunch was a ""3"", but I gave the overall rating a 4 because I did not want my last experience to dictate what could be the only rating I would post on them.  We were there when it opened at 11:00 am.  The hot dim sum was ""LUKEWARM"" - Sooo unpleasant!   We ordered choy sum with oyster sauce but they did not pour cooked oil over the greens (that is a basic thing to do when serving boiled greens otehrwise it is too dry and lacks flavor).  C;mon guys you gotta do better.   I do not know if there is a new head chef.   Luckilym both of my favorites (chow mean and Mandarin beef noodle) tasted as great as always."
"Made a reservation for lunch at Noodles this week. I  really enjoyed the wonton soup with shrimp dumplings, so hot and delicious! The plate of salt and pepper shrimp was a really huge portion of food and so good.  The service was truly exceptional,. Drinks constantly refilled, food delivered promptly, manager checked in a few times.  Really exceptional service thank you"
"We came in 30 mins before closing and were seated immediately.  The server was prompt and put in our order. The food came out lightening fast and was hot and delicious. This is an excellent. This is a great Change of pace as opposed to  the 5 Star , very expensive signature restaurants at Bellagio."
We really enjoyed the food at this restaurant. The waitress helped suggest items that we could make vegan. We had the Sweet and Spicy Noodles with Tofu and Kimchi. Everything was delicious and the service was wonderful! Thank you!
"Having lived for years in SE Asia, I LOVE noodle dishes.  So for lunch one day during our stay we came to Noodles here in the Bellagio Resort.  I ordered the noodle soup with pork, my wife had Chicken Satay with peanut sauce.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the broth...just not very rich, overall rather tasteless.  The peanut sauce for the satay was just average...again, lacking in taste.  The Thai Ice Tea was excellent.  Service was good, not exceptional, but the server checked on us once and our order was taken in a timely manner. Atmosphere was pleasant.   I don't think I will return as I think I can find better elsewhere."
"Visited in 2010, so, had to go back as the noodle dishes reminded me of time in Japan.  Noodle dishes are huge and had a hard time eating most of mine.  My husband had a hard time too.  I had one of the noodle dishes made with miso broth (vice chicken or beef).  Did not seem salty at the time, but, later, I noticed it was difficult to take off my rings.  Next time in Vegas, I will try to eat here again as it is great!"
This restaurant is more like a cafe and very casual but good Asian food and located in the Bellagio Hotel. We ordered edamame and fried rice for a snack and it came quickly and was very fresh. I would no t recommend dinner just because of the atmosphere but the food it above average.
"The food reminded me of food eaten while traveling in Asia years ago.  Very tasty.  I can't say anything we had was bad, but the service was not up to what I expected at the Bellagio.  No one was rude or anything, but I did feel rushed a bit, while at the same time, ignored a bit.  With that said, it is not a high end restaurant.  It is casual sit down establishment that doesn't require reservations weeks in advance and the dress is casual as well."
"Nice place but for a restaurant inside the Bellagio we expected better in terms of service especially. The waitress kept coming to take our order, without giving us time to choose. Hearty, decent dishes, very spicy for some, more bland for others. Bottle for €75 placed directly on the table, without ice bucket. Still with the fork in our mouth as the waitress wanted to take the dishes away from us. We therefore expressed our dissatisfaction by validating the minimum amount on the payment terminal when paying the bill."
Great authentic noodle dishes at this restaurant! We had Udon and Pad Thai and were very happy with the food and the service. This restaurant is tucked away in a quiet corner off of the casino floor. Make reservations because they were turning away people that didn’t have them. And this was at 10 pm on a week night.
"Everything was bland. I’m still sitting here at Noodles while I write this. We are a group of 5 and I recommend this to my family since it was great when I ate here July 2022.

The dimsum was cold - shrimp balls, shumai and pork buns.

The Pho, bbq pork noodle soups, oriental fried rice and shrimp egg noodles were so bland we had to douse them with fish sauce or soy sauce. The Mongolian beef didn’t have the hint of sweetness but at least it was tender.

I’m so embarrassed to have recommended this place."
Such a great pan Asian spot! The menu has a variety of pan Asian cuisines with the overarching theme of noodles. We arrived for lunch and were seated very quickly. Our order was also taken quite quickly with the food arriving in no time at all. Each dish was yummy. I will 100% return
First visit and we’ll be back. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was cozy. Our orders were very tasty. The fried rice needed a little more flavor. We thought it a little flat. Otherwise everything was fresh. .
"We ordered Pad Thai, a fairly common dish. The noodles were wide, sticking together, the sauce had no flavor and the chicken supposed to come with it almost inexistent. Worst meal we've had in a long time. Service was so so at best. Certainly don't recommend!!"
"I usually make one stop here on every trip for a bowl of soup.  Food is always good. Service is more like a fast food counter.  Take your order and bring your food,  No recommendations or checking back on you.  It seems no matter what time I come or how busy it is, they always sit me at the bar.  I know I am a single diner, but I would like a table sometimes. Great for late night bites since other restaurants are closed. Little pricey, but you are in the Bellagio hotel so I guess that is expected.  I will be back on my next trip."
Ate here with family and enjoyed our meal.  Everyone enjoyed the pad thai we shared.  The fried rice was a little plain so pass on that one.  The Chinese Mandarin can be adjusted for spiciness.  Worth a visit.
"It's inside the Bellagio, in a somewhat hidden location in the middle of the casino. Well decorated and comfortable house. We ordered tempura, yaki noodles and a Kung Po shrimp, as an option from the menu of the day. We found it to be OK overall, with reasonable service and the same prices."
"My family needed a restaurant for dinner before the Cirque show O at the Bellagio.  This restaurant is conveniently located in the hotel, and we were seated quickly.  Despite a big crowd, we didn't have to wait long for the food which was plentiful and tasty."
We had reservations at 5:00 on a Wednesday and there was small wait to get our table.  Service was good but the two dishes my wife and I had were just ok.  I had Singapore rice with chicken and my wife had the Cantonese duck.  A little pricey for what you got.  Just ok in our opinion and probably wouldn't spend the $80 with tip to go back.
"Restaurant was very over priced.  I had a bowl of soup with shrimp and noodles, taste was okay.  Soup and Tea was $29.  It only had about 4-5 shrimp.  This was a poor choice on my part, but everything else was too expensive.  Staff was great though and there was a little bit of a language barrier."
"Good atmosphere , most of staff very friendly. Suspect grumpy old guy that grunts and waves you off when asking ?'s is a helping uncle or some thing. Had sake, Hong Kong fried noodles and sea food pho. All good and reasonably priced.  Wife loved it. It was more safe, knew what i was getting, not a lets go out to eat fine dining kinda restaurant to me. Being grunted at and waved off when asking for water was funny though. Second person was very nice and took care of us."
My husband & I wanted something quick and not too filling for lunch so we ate here. I ate the Japanese Seafood Udon Soup. Very good! My husband ate the Kung Pao Shrimp which was spicy but good. We waited about 30 min to get in but well worth it. Service was fast. This place also excepts take out orders.
We are big dim sum fans and go to Noodles every time we go to Vegas.  The har gau is excellent.  We also like the Oriental fried rice.  Just a simple preparation but very tasty.
"Visited late afternoon when the place was fairly quiet as we were going out later. Service was good, sharp in fact, but the team did not seem the happiest bunch of campers. Food was, at this price, sadly average."
"We ate at Noodles for the first time during our latest stay.
WOW, the service was very quick, and the folks were very friendly. That alone makes for a nice experience, but the food was delicious, and the service was very quick. Definitely will be back!"
"We reserved in advance which was great because they were turning people away.  The food was SO flavourful.  Our waitress was lovely.  In Vegas terms, great value.  The only challenge was that we sat at the front of the restaurant, and the smoke from the casino was not particularly pleasant.  Nevertheless, we had a wonderful meal and were very glad we went."
"Consistently good food, esp the Wonton soup. Love their sweet and sour and their delicious dim sum.
Try the watermelon juice .. also great.
Never had an issue with service, unlike others it seems."
"Awesome food  and  Excellent Service ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ 

Our first visit to Las Vegas and first visit to this awesome restaurant. Greeted GM by Chef Patrick and team and felt home . Service was great and the food was delicious and presentation were nice too . We will definitely come back here next time . Kudos to the entire team ! The organisation must he proud to have them . Thank you 😊"
"I make it a point to visit Noodles everytime I stay at Bellagio.  I specifically like the calamari and the Pad Thai.  It is consistently good.  But, be sure you make a reservation.  You don't want to wait a hour on the wait list."
"Good place for quick lunch. Good service, good food. 
Relatively inexpensive by LV standards. A bit noisy but acceptable."
"Quick seating, clean atmosphere, good food, I could bring my casino cocktail in with me. Highly recommend for a quick bite."
"Quick seating, I could bring my casino cocktail in, immediate service, good food, clean and efficient. Highly recommend for a quick bite."
"Great restaurant - comfortable, friendly servers and open late!  Food is very good.  Varied menu with nightly specials."
"Noodles is reliably awesome.  Today it was roti and chicken satay.  Service was prompt and excellent.  Food delicious, sauces perfect.  Look forward to visiting again this week."
"A vet delicious lunch with amazing service. The staff were all very sweet. Food was quick, fresh and delicious. I would recommend and wouldn’t hesitate to go back with friends. Thank you."
Worst Pad Thai I've had. It was way too sweet and no spice. I switched my husband for his Japanese  noodles which were pretty bland. We also both had tummy troubles afterward. I do not recommend.
"Expensive, small portions, surprisingly bland for Chinese food, but still the only semi reasonable prices in Bellagio."
"I ordered the sweet and sour chicken to go.  The entree was ok, nothing to rave about but good enough I would go back and get it again, probably would try something different first."
"Good atmosphere , most of staff very friendly. Suspect grumpy old guy that grunts and waves you off when asking ?'s is a helping uncle or some thing.

"Nice gem in the Bellagio. The food was great (5 stars) but service was poor. Several tables, including outs, had to flag down the water to ask for water, to order, etc"
"If planning to eat here, make a reservation, which is kind of the rule of thumb in Vegas. Service was excellent. Large menu to choose from. Food was delicious!"
"Had noodles and chicken.  Noodles were a bit oily, chicken tasted boiled.  Not much flavor.  Husband had the beef and said it was good."
"As you would expect by the name, a large menu featuring dishes with all types of noodles and choice of meat is the star of this restaurant, as well as other choices.  We shared excellent shrimp tempura and soup with dumplings, as well as a delicious noodle dish with chicken.  Reservations suggested.  Highly recommend!"
"If you think Panda Express is bad, Noodles in the Bellagio is worse. Hands down Noodles is the worst Chinese restaurant in the universe."

So good!  This place had the most incredible menu and is such a gem in Las Vegas!  Located right inside the Bellagio so it is very convenient.  Make reservations!  Noodles was the best and the most reasonably priced restaurant on our trip - and everything else was really good too!  My teenagers had plenty of options and we all left full and happy!
We had reservations at 5:00 on a Wednesday and there was small wait to get our table.  Service was good but the two dishes my wife and I had were just ok.

Quick meal when you don’t have a reservation?   This will be fine.  Not memorable or delicious noodles.  Our elections were all beige and oily.  Fried green beans were good.  This is fine in a pinch and has some gf option
"Lovely restaurant right off the casino floor at the Bellagio. Large menu, yet each item is distinct and carefully chosen.

"The staff is super,portions are large,price is reasonable.
Food comes out quickly and hot.
I thought the wonton soup with shrimp dumplings was bland,but everything else was very good."
"Made a reservation for lunch at Noodles this week. I  really enjoyed the wonton soup with shrimp dumplings, so hot and delicious!

"I went for tempura meal, was seated at the counter with a view of the food preparation area The tempura heavy and very oily"
"We've been eating at Noodles for many years and even during a global pandemic, they do not disappoint! Their food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. The staff are always extremely polite and welcoming. This is a must-do for us anytime we are staying in Vegas or even passing through."

nice taste and very quick. I will surely be ordering again from you guys. i would recommend to my friends too....
By far the best Asian cuisine any in our party had ever had.  Every thing we tried (6 dishes in all) was so good!  Exceptional quality for the price; about $130 for 6 people!
"They have the advantage of being one of the only places open during the week at Bellagio.  With almost everything closed during the week, they have a monopoly on the joint!

This monopoly hasn't affected the quality of the food though.  The service can be hit or miss, we went twice on our last stay, service was great one time and horrible the other. 

They have a great variety of noodle dishes, as well as other common favorites.  The Pho and Beef Satay were excellent.  Don't be afraid to order a cocktail while you are there, they are mad at the bar located just outside the restaurant.  I can take a bit of time to get them though!!

All in all, I'd certainly go back if I was staying in the hotel, but not a place I'd make a dedicated trip to.  Too many other great options in Vegas for noodles."
Good food - not crazily priced - they get you in and out - it has become a victim of its own popularity - in the past you could just walk in now it is hard to get into
The soups were amazing and the prices didn't break the bank. During Covid they can only seat 4 to a table and the wait is a bit longer. Staff was friendly. Order the pad thai t and the pho. You will not be disappointed.
"Pricey but very good noodles - 
Fast - 
Service is inattentive but damned fine food -‘best noodles around"
Located within the Bellagio complex.  Servings of Shui Mai and Vietnamese beef noodles were both small.  Not much taste to either but expensive.  Poor value.
"Restaurant was very over priced.  I had a bowl of soup with shrimp and noodles, taste was okay.  Soup and Tea was $29.  It only had about 4-5 shrimp.  This was a poor choice on my part, but everything else was too expensive.  Staff was great though and there was a little bit of a language barrier."
"Visited in 2010, so, had to go back as the noodle dishes reminded me of time in Japan.  Noodle dishes are huge and had a hard time eating most of mine.  My husband had a hard time too.  I had one of the noodle dishes made with miso broth (vice chicken or beef).  Did not seem salty at the time, but, later, I noticed it was difficult to take off my rings.  Next time in Vegas, I will try to eat here again as it is great!"
"The Bellagio is host to some very impressive restaurants with some very expensive bill tabs, but Noodles is a great little restaurant near the casino entrance. The staff are friendly and efficient. The menu has plenty to choose from and the food is delicious."
"In a city where a cocktail can cost $20 it's to find a spot that isn't trying to gauge your wallet. My friend and I shared the $30 price fix meal at Nooles and with a choice of soup, appetizer and entree, it was plenty for both. The small restaurant is lovely and quiet and the food was delicious. I can imagine there might be a lengthy wait during busy travel times but we only waited a few minutes."
Good for lunch or dinner with standard dishes in a nice atmosphere. This restaurant is nice dining without the fancy prices. No unique but convenient to guests of Bellagio
"Great service and great food!  If you like hot noodle dishes, you'll love this place.  Potstickers were excellent."
"The food is both delicious and authentic.
We enjoyed both the appetizers and the noodle entrees.
They don't mess around with the iced tea, either--huge, and served with a proper spoon!
Service was good, but prices seemed high for Asian food.
The ambiance is very good."
Excellent food!  Loved everything we ordered - the tofu dish was especially awesome.  The authentic Asian-style soy milk was delicious as well.
"This place has amazing noodles, the best i've tasted before. Sometimes you might think it's a little expensive for just noodles."
"During a business trip late last summer, we dined at Noodles in the Bellagio and were more than pleasantly surprised. From outside appearances, our expectations were actually quite low.  Here is yet another valuable lesson in not judging books by their cover. After a short wait for seating, we received extremely courteous service and exemplary authentic Asian Rim food made fresh to order; none of that prefabricated Americanized stuff. We’ve enjoyed some stellar Asian cuisine around the country, especially in several different China Towns over the years. This food at Noodles was actually comparable, and in some ways better. Our next trip to Vegas will definitely include another delicious meal at Noodles."
"We ordered the duck, broccoli with oyster sauce, crispy orange chicken and pork fried rice.  The meal was served hot and was good - not great.  The tables are close and it is noisy.  The service was good."
The beef noodle dish really was tasteless. The shrimp pad thai was good. Tables very close together - so much so that when the table next to us was served I got bumped on 3 separate occasions by the waitress. Cant have a conversation with out the table both sides hearing. It needs 1 less table on the 2 seaters and more space. Really disappointed with the taste of the food.
We are big dim sum fans and go to Noodles every time we go to Vegas.  The har gau is excellent.  We also like the Oriental fried rice.  Just a simple preparation but very tasty.
"The wait was long, the service was poor, the food was tasteless... Panda Express has more flavor. Not one dish we ordered had any taste. No salt... no flavor... it is like the chef took the day off and the dish washer took over the kitchen... Don't waste your money here... Go to LA LA Noodle at the Park MGM."
"I usually make one stop here on every trip for a bowl of soup.  Food is always good. Service is more like a fast food counter.  Take your order and bring your food,  No recommendations or checking back on you.  It seems no matter what time I come or how busy it is, they always sit me at the bar.  I know I am a single diner, but I would like a table sometimes. Great for late night bites since other restaurants are closed. Little pricey, but you are in the Bellagio hotel so I guess that is expected.  I will be back on my next trip."
"Located inside Bellagio Hotel in Vegas, this restaurant has a nice ambience and it's suitable for family dining. Though it was a long line up and wait time to get a table as reservations can't be made, the service was great and fast. My son who's very particular and picky about food, enjoyed the noodles and dumplings. Most nice restaurants in Ceaser's Palace and Bellagio close at 10, but this opens until late."
"At a very late hour, Noodles was open and busy.  As the name implies, its all about noodles (Pad Thai, Udon, you name it).  The food was good, the prices reasonable.  The service was a bit slow, but not too bad."
"This is a restaurant at the Bellagio casino/hotel. We were looking for Asian food and found this restaurant. Although we arrived at 8 PM, we were seated immediately. Lulu, our waitress was very thorough and fast. However, we didn't see her when it was time to pay our bill. 

We ordered the fixed price menu featuring wonton soup, fried spring rolls & pad thai with flat noodles. The food was quite tasty. We liked it. It was authentically Asian. 

The restaurant is clean though it fills up quickly at rush hour. Note that prices are much higher than regular oriental restaurants. 

I recommend this restaurant if looking for Asian food. I'd be a return customer next time we're at Bellagio's."
Food was good but service was slow from being seated to getting our bill. Seemed like we were interrupting the matrie d when we walked up.He created us and asked how many and then he made us stand for about 7-8 minutes while he sifted through some paperwork. He then pronounced that he was ready to seat us.... lots of open tables so I’m not sure what that was all about.
We went for a late night dinner and there are not many options in the Bellagio. The service was great the food was very good just not great. We ordered the  spring rolls for an appetizer and shared an order on Mongolian beef served with white rice. The spring rolls were over cooked and had little filling. The beef how ever was very good. Plate is large enough to share with the bowl of rice. They have several options  of different noodles and other classic dishes.
This is a very authentic Asian food restaurant. The food is excellent and has been consistently great for years.
"Ate here a couple of night ago. Service was good and the food was fine - however, there aren't vegan options, despite it being listed as having them. I assume it's changed since previous reviews were left, as there's no separate vegan menu (which is mentioned in earlier reviews) - and the soya chicken isn't a meat alternate, it's real chicken cooked in a soy sauce.

When I asked what vegan options there was, I was offered a couple of meat dishes (chicken fried rice was one), without the meat. I don't consider that a vegan option - a meat dish with the meat removed is a poor substitute. I had a few side dishes cobbled together to make a meal (steamed rice, vegetables, tofu), which all tasted fine - but didn't feel like a proper meal.

So just a heads up if you are vegan, this isn't somewhere I'd recommend."
After walking hours on the strip was great to sit and have a delightful meal.  The menu is enticing and decisions not easy to make.  They have Prix Fix Menu that is reasonable and almost too much food to eat.  I chose appetizers that gave me a full feel for the restaurant.  Want to go back before we leave Las Vegas.
"Went for lunch on Saturday and had a dim sum feast.   I'll double down on my earlier review and say that this would be the best Chinese restaurant in most cities.   

We ordered Xiao Long Bao, Pork Bun, Shrimp and Mushroom dumplings, Crispy Fried Shrimp Balls, and a chicken chow main.   All excellent.  Great service - very quick if anything.  Reasonable prices for Bellagio.  I'd love to eat there again very soon."
This is a cute restaurant located in the Bellagio. There is a pretty extensive menu and the food is fairly reasonably priced. I really enjoyed the duck noodle soup and the service was exceptional
"Situated in Bellagio - went along as my partner wanted Chinese food. Cooked fresh and in view of customers the food was amazing. Often with Chinese food I feel unwell afterwards and I think it’s because MSG is added. This place obviously does NOT do this - it was so fresh. I had pak choi and it was so tasty and sorry to repeat myself but fresh! Was nice to have some good food that felt it was doing me some good as Vegas has so many temptations of burgers, chips and pizza etc. This restaurant also had a lot of Chinese customers and I think this is often a good indication of authentic food cooked well."
"Noodles has this excellent taste of Canton China, of Hong Kong, the taste of home, of my dad´s cooking...... It´s a place that I feel as a little kind in a candy store.
Great place for Dim Sum
On the other hand all I have tried there has been a great dish.... I keep eating so much there than all the times I have gone I have had 2 waiters because I stay so long eating that they have to change shift hehehehehehehehe.
I don´t care to leave with a big bally, I don´t care barely I can walk after eating there, beacuse I enjoy it so much!!!!!!"
"Good food, great service. A table was immediately available. The waiter was very attentive. Glass of wine, tasty food. Happy customer."
We stood in line for 25 minutes while the maitre d argued with a customer about the price of his meal.  There were plenty of seats in the restaurant.  When finally seated we ordered  a small bowl of soup (chicken broth & spinach--ok) Pad Thai (bland) and tempura (bland).  The bill for these little pretties was $46.

Good Asian food and reasonably priced for a restaurant inside a major hotel like the Bellagio. The service was quick and efficient and no complaints about the food what so ever.
"When my wife and I want to slow down, relax and enjoy a nice dining experience, we make our way to Noodles.  Their dim sum variety makes for trying new items easy and their extensive, but simple menu allows for ease of ordering.  Be patient as your food does take time but you will be rewarded.  We will return to Noodles on our next visit."
Good chinese restaurant inside the bellagio hotel. Good and smiling staff. A little bit time to have a seat.
Have enjoyed multiple meals at Noodles.  Liked every dish ... really enjoy the Dim Sum (not available every day).  You can tell just how good it is by the number of Asian customers.
"We visited for dinner. Service was fine. The food was terrible. We hand chicken chow mein and beef pad thai. Very bland flavor and the noodles seemed way over cooked, mush. Chicken was gross. I recommend you choose somewhere else to have dinner."
High-quality real food! It is my favorite Chinese restaurant! The water spinach is my absolute favorite side dish. I once took a three our detour after skiing in Mammoth to get the Shiu mai (pork and shrimp dumplings) Each one has a whole shrimp inside!
"Excellent!  Loved the Pad Thai!  Very fresh, not the usual over spiced hot pad Thai, this was sweet and tasty!  Good service."
"Had the Hong Kong style noodles with seafood. Seasoning was ok. Noodles were prepared well. Seaffod and vegetables were of average portions. Dish should have been served warmer. Service was average, although the cashier was a bit rude. Overall, ok value based on Las Vegas strip pricing."
Decided to change it up and visit.  We were not disappointed.  The service was excellent.  The food was very good but I could see why some have said it was a little bland.  Tried the ribs which the waiter said were sweet.  I don’t like very sweet ribs and these were not sweet at all.  The pad Thai was very good.  Beef fried rice had little beef in it though.  Not very flavorful but ok.  All in all I would go back and it was good.  Not the best but very good.
Wanted something quick and easy.  Great menu and service here.  Food is fresh and very delicious.  Would recommend.
"The wonton soup was very good, but a bit too salty. Shrimp pad thai just average. Service was very slow. You can find much better asian food in las vegas."
Make sure to get the Wonton soup with the shrimp wontons.  They are seriously unbelievably flavorful and delicious. Would return just for the soup.  Gave 4 stars because the rest of the meal was average/good and they don’t take reservations- which I would always prefer bc I am a planner and like to have things set up in advance.
"We had dinner here together with our children. Unfortunately, they were already very tired, also because we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Our meals were very good, but as the kids needed to go to bed, we couldn't enjoy all of our food, and had to leave early. The staff did not make any fuzz about it, they were very friendly and professionnal, and enabled us to carry our half remaining bottle of us to our room. Would certainly recommend this place!"
Inside Hotel California in downtown. Excellent food at reasonable prices. Best Asian food — Southeast Asia — in Vegas.
Make sure you get a bowl of their wonton soup and dim sum. The atmosphere is nice. Both times we visited the servers seemed put out that they had to serve us. We would still go back for the food though.

"Husband and I wanted to go to this restaurant since we saw it while checking in! 
I felt bad because they were short staffed and there was one lady manning the front and the to go orders. Props to her for holding down the fort and getting us all seated in a decent amount of time.

We were not aware that the players sizes are shareable. We shared the vegetable potstickers, which were delicious. I ordered vegetable fried rice (pictured) and my husband ordered Hong Kong beef egg noodles (pictured). It was very good! Well worth the wait!"
We were hungry and ate here because we happened to run across it.  The selections was amazing and everything we ate was delicious.
"Despite the other poor reviews I saw online, I thought i'd given it a try since I was dining early (before 6pm) and by myself.
Once seated, it took 15 minutes for the server to acknowledge me and that's only after I went back to the hostess stand asking for her to intervene after I saw other tables being served that came in after me.
The waitress spoke very broken english and annoyed at the questions I was asking about the dishes.  Once she delivered my entree she never came back and I ran out of water.  I then had to flag down someone else to try to get my check.  From the time I sat down to the time I paid it was well over an hour - for a party of one in a half empty restaurant.
Food is decent but not good enough to go back and tolerate the poor service...too many other choices in Vegas."
"We came to Noodles because of the good reviews and the impression it might be vegetarian-friendly for my daughter.  Unfortunately, there was little for her to choose from.  Her vegetables tasted like boiled vegetables.  That's it - no sauce, no spice, just asparagus and bok choy.  My husband went with the chicken pad thai.  It had flavor, just not great flavor, and it was quite greasy.  My chicken soya was exactly as described - a half breast of chicken on peanuts.  The sauce was basically soy sauce.  It was pretty unappetizing.  Weirdly, my chicken came out ten minutes before the other dishes.  So, I had to choose between ""eat before anyone else is served"" or """"eat cold chicken."""
"Chicken Pad Thai - that is all!
Delicious. This was our go to restaurant in the Bellagio - tasty, filling and good value"
"Coming there since 10 years always good, always quick, always good price quality quantity it is perfect noodles restaurant!"
"Very good food and service. My only complaints are that my duck portion was on the small side, (on the contrary, my wife and daughter's serving was quite large), and $5 for a soda seems high. That said, I would definitely return."
Noodles was a great restaurant - the food was amazing and being able to see what options were available for appetizers was nice!
"Large delicious and easily shareable portions.
Opened late at night if you consider 1am late.
Take out also available for your room if kids aren’t allowed in casinos."
Expensive and tasteless meal. Don't bother... anything would be better. Service was decent but it took too long to get dinner.
"My friend absolutely loves the lobster--
The dim sum is good-8 on a scale of 1-10.
The waiting lines are disgraceful and tiresome.
The service is adequate.
The food is quite good."
"Food fresh and made to order. Friendly staff. Hot and fresh and worth the little extra cost. Menu with great variety of noodle dishes, soups, appetizers. If you're not sure what you want, ask the staff for a recommendation."
"We like eating at Noodles for their large selection, professional service and fast. Sometimes you need an area to relax and unwind. Love the cucumber salad."
"Las Vegas has many excellent Asian restaurants and I’ve eaten at several. Having said that, Noodles, in the Bellagio, in my opinion, is the BEST, not just in Las Vegas but just about any one I’ve eaten in. 

The atmosphere is casual and most customers around us seem to be having a great time. My fiance and I shared three dishes: Vegetable spring rolls, beef hor fun and mixed vegetables. All were outstanding.

Over the years I’ve discovered that Asian restaurants frequented by Asians is generally a good sign. About half the customers the night we ate there were Asian. One could argue that many of them may have been hotel guests at the Bellagio, but they could jsut have easily taken a cab to other Asian restaurants.

Of all the restaurants at the Bellagio (we ate at least three others, plus several in hotels connected to the Bellagio,) but this was the best meal we ate (although my fiance might diasagree that this was the best.)

Whether you are staying at the Bellagio or at another hotel on the strip, I highly suggest you try to find the time to have a meal at Noodles. You won’t be disappointed."
"First time ever for Noodles.  Just was walking by and decided to try it out.  The food was great.  Lots of flavor and spice.  Not hot, just very intense flavor.  The service here was awesome.  The servers were very friendly and never had to ask for refill of beverage.  Obviously a bit pricey being on the strip, but well worth the extra money.  I'd recommend anyone who likes noodle based dishes to try it out.  So many choices, you'll find one you would really like."
"Tough I am not a passionate chi use food lover I have to admit I liked this restaurant.
I tried some noodles prepare at Singapore style I was good!"
I had the tempura shrimp and my wife had Japanese udon. Both dishes were well prepared and hot when served. We will eat here again.
"I regularly get together with Business partners who fly into Las Vegas for our meetings.  They love staying at the Bellagio, so grabbing a quick, delicious bite at Noodles, talking over any business thoughts we have and then letting my partners get back to some fun makes this place ideal.  Haven't had a bad dish yet....and staff knows just when to drop by and take an order or check in on us.  They get it all done right!"
"Noodles has a wide range of menu options, but listed few vegetarian options.  I asked if they would substitute tofu for the chicken in the singapore curry noodles.  After some discussion with the server she said yes.  The dish was excellent and the tofu was nicely marinated and prepared.  The serving was huge, cost approximately $19, and I wish I could have brought the remainder home.  I also had the vegetable spring rolls which came piping hot, with a nice sauce, and they were delicious.  I look forward to returning to Noodles."
Delightful dining in style at a classic noodle house. The Singapore noodles are some of the best in Las Vegas. Great place to eat before a show at Bellagio.
"When Noodles first opened when Bellagio was brand new, the food quality was good.  The quality has gone down hill.  Service is average, price is too high for what you are getting.  Quality is Not good.  Will not return."
"Noodles is in the Bellagio where we went to watch a show. After the show, we were looking for something quick which led us to Noodles. The decoration in Noodles is fancy.The food on the menu however, is pretty generic Asian food you can get for much cheaper at any other place. There is an array of noodle soup, congee, and other dishes. The food wasn't the best, considering the price you pay, but the service was acceptable and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time."
Visited January 2018 with two teens. The kids enjoyed the food. I would recommend eating here again. The line was short which was a plus.
"Service is subpar.
Asian ladies live up to the stereotype.  They walk away when they are talking to you or you to them.  They cut you off and talk over you.  They bring you items you did not ask for and insist you did.  
I get better service on the streets of Bangkok.
Prices are fair.
Food is fair.
Nothing special."
"We had tickets for a 7:00 show and needed to have dinner in an hour.  Noodles has a lot of different Asian choices, not just one cuisine.  We shared several dishes; the tempura vegetables were fresh and crispy, chicken satay was made with a single piece of chicken on each skewer and fresh peanut sauce, and the Yaki Udon noodles were just delicious.  Very happy that we stopped here!"
Waited 20 mins for a table but nice traditional Asian cuisine. Flavour slightly lacking for the price. Service was fast and friendly.
This small restaurant has a great selection of dim sum and Asian entrees...it's pleasant but pricey  $50/pp for typical Asian dim sum and entree.
"This place opens from 11 am to 2 am , and offers simple Cantonese style noodles and dishes , like roast duck , steam chicken , beef hofun , pan fried noodles etc .   We came here 5/6 times during our stay for lunch , afternoon or late snack. ,
. The best dish is wonton and beef tendon noodle ,and crab meat rice noodle ,  Hong Kong style . Ware melon juice good too"
The service here was not the best but the food was surprisingly good compare to other asian restaurant we went too. Very good place to eat after a late show. Way better than the Bellagio buffet. Recommended.
"The potsticker appetizer and noodle main dish were exceptional.  It was fresh -- farm-to-table quality at a reasonable price.  The Thai tea with cream was luscious, not too sweet, yet flavorable.  Service was attentive and personable.  It was a yummy experience."
The food is amazing. We had dumplings and pork buns for lunch that were amazing! We had delicious dinners here too! You cannot go wrong as everything on the menu is delicious and well priced!
"Good place.  Overpriced like most Strip casino places.  Although relative to other places in Bellagio, probably a bargain.

Nothing exceptional

The thing to know is that the name may be Noodles, and the decor may consist of hundreds of jars of dried noodles on the wall.... but the fare is more.

We had cucumber salad... a ridiculously tiny plate of dry cucumber slices.   Tempura shrimp and calamari.  A sea bass in a brown sauce.   Pad Thai.  And Hong Kong Crispy Noodles.  Nothing was bad, but I was expecting much more focus on Chinese hand-pulled noodles.

Menu includes lots of soups, rice dishes, proteins, veggies, even chow mein.

If you want good solid Americanized Asian food, and aren't an adventurous foodie, go."
"Good size portions, but service was not great.  There was four of us in our party, we all ordered appetizers and a main course.  All of our appetizers and meals came at different times.  By the time the last person got their meal the first person was almost done.  We ordered a drink when we sat down and didn’t get it until we were finished our meal.  The food was fresh and the value is good for Vegas.  I would recommend this restaurant for the food, but not for the service.  Staff not very friendly.  Don’t expect to all eat together at the same time."
I have been to noodle many times and it is a great restaurant in the Belagio that is not well known.  I had chow mein with chicken.  It was very good and you could add spice to it to make it hotter.  This is a little known restaurant with good prices and good food.
"The restaurant has a good ambiance. The seating and the decor are well done. They are open until 2 AM which is a good option for party animals looking for a hungry bite. We ordered Tempura Shrimp, Mixed Vegetables, Hainanese Chicken Rice and Flat Rice Noodles. The Jasmine Pearl Tea was a good drink to start with. The Shrimp appetizers were very yummy. The Flat Rice Noodles was too oily. The Hainanese Chicken Rice was a little too sweet and therefore unpalatable to our spicy taste buds. The service was quick and efficient and all the food tasted fresh. I would recommend this place for those who love Chinese cuisine."
"This used to be a favorite place of ours but after a few mediocre meals we gave it a 2 year break. Tried it again this trip and it was terrible!  Fried rice was so bland we had to add soy sauce for flavor. Not sure what sauce they used for the Pad Thai but is smelled and tasted terrible!  Last time, never again!  Too many good places in Vegas to eat!  This is not one of em!"
Great place great food. Large portions for good prices. Very nice setting an enjoyable meal. Will certainly return.
"The food was great! We had the potstickers, crab fried rice and a crab vermicelli. It was some of the best and freshest tasting Asian food we have eaten. One of my favorite meals since we have been in Vegas."
"I am no expert on Asian foods, but the noodle soup that I had here was excellent! It had pork, noodles, bok choi, broth, and I think there was even some duck in there."
"For late night food at the hotel, the oriental cuisine is perfect. Queu a bit but worth trying. Recommended."
Menu had a good selection of dishes. Food and service was very good. Food came out quite quickly and was very good. Portions are not as big as Chinatown and prices are double but thats what you have to pay for in the heart of the Strip.
"Visited for dinner on a whim, and left satisfied with both service and meal. Mid-range pricing, the menu is definitely more catered toward a tourist or someone not necessarily familiar with real Chinese food. Items that would be found in a takeout place were served, but also some others that will placate a more discerning palate. Service was extremely friendly and helpful. People expecting a prompt service during rush hour should not be surprised to wait in line, as the space is not large."
"Enough accommodation.Polite and courteous staff. Lots of choice in the menu.Food awesome,specially the dishes with shrimps."
"Dim Sum, Duck Soup and sake. Had all three for lunch and was as good as it was last time. One of my favorite places for Chinese soups."
"Our go to spot for dim sum every time we come to Las Vegas. There’s usslly a line on the weekends so go early, play video poker at the Bellagio bar and when the line starts to form, get in it!! Even if you have to wait, it’s worth it!!"
"Good option for Asian at the Bellagio, the pan-fried dumplings were flavorful, then had the beef stew bowl and the seafood pho, both very large, served piping hot, beef was tender and the shrimp were good size and perfectly cooked, couldn't finish them...friendly service and reasonable value ($98.00, inc T&T), for Vegas that is!"
Went to noodles for a snack in the afternoon. Decided to have a bowl of wanton soup thinking it would hold me till supper. Well that bowl of soup was so big I couldn’t even finish it and full of wantons!!!
"I enjoyed the seafood noodle. It has plenty of fish and shrimp. Considering the price, it was the good quality meal. My family also enjoyed their food."
"This Chinese Dim Sum Restaurant is found in Bellagio Hotel, in the depth of the Casino, directly across Jasmine restaurant, another Cantonese Restaurant in Las Vegas.

For Dim Sum, we ordered the standard items Shiu Mai, Char Siu Pau. Dim Sum quality is good, it is only a pity the selection is quite little. We also ordered Edamame and Malaysian Roti Prata as the sides. 

We had Century Egg with Pork Congee, Japanese fried Beef Udon, Wonton Noodles soup. I would say the standard is above average in US. 

For the drinks, I would recommend the American Ginseng with Honey and Soya Milk."
"Dim Sum .... doughy no flavor
Pad Thai .... no flavor
Kung Pao Shrimp .... 6 shrimp and the rest was onions
Soda .... no syrup - came out with bubbles

Service was horrible.  She went on a break and literally came back 1/2 hour later.  Horrible dining experience.  Can't believe the Bellagio has this restaurant in their casino."
"Great food, went two times for dinner in 3 nights I stayed. Why? because it is cheaper than other places, food is good and not that heavy on your stomach. They have great chines and japanese beer."
"Waited at the entrance for a few minutes, got my own menu, seated myself. Water smelt like fish. Will not go back and can't believe the bellagio hosts such a poor standard. One star for the manager who helped after I started complaining at the top of my voice."
"The temperature had recently dropped in Las Vegas and I was recovering from a bad cold so the wonton soup really hit the spot! So flavorful without being super salty. The chicken fried rice on the other hand a bit bland. I had to add soy sauce which I never do. Service was fair but not great. But the restaurant was quite busy even though it was an odd time of day, 3pm."
Visited last night. Food was cold and mediocre. Service was pathetic. Didn't serve courses in order or serve our group at the same time.
"On Friday and Saturday Noodles has Dim Sum all fresh made on sight, it was so awesome we went both days, they even have Kimchi. It is Fantastic and you will not go wrong stopping in for Dim Sum the also offer the regular menu which is outstanding once again everything made in-house a Fantastic Restaurant - the GM & Executive Chef travel to China every year and bring new menu ideas back every year and ingredients. 
An outstanding Restaurant!"
"We made a point to go enjoy dim sum at Noodles during our recent trip to LV and it did not disappoint! All of the dim sum - fried and steamed - was served hot and fresh, just delicious. Service was friendly and prompt as well. Definitely a permanent fixture on our places to eat list in Las Vegas."
"We love our Asian restaurant at home, Noodles exceeds it!!! We had the fixed menu which , for the price, is delicious and filling. Between the three of us, we had the wonton with shrimp ( big shrimp!), egg role or pot stickers, and pad Thai with chicken or shrimp. All of it was wonderful. Service was very attentive. Every trip to Vegas, we eat here because it’s so good!!!"
"Average pan-asian food, at best. Much better asian dining options elsewhere on the strip. Even in terms of late night options (this is the only late night restaurant at Bellagio), I'd recommend venturing elsewhere for a bite as it's expensive and really not memorable."
Uninspired shrimp chow mein. Spend your time and money at a more memorable place. Attentive service doesn’t make up for average food.
"Service staffs are super professional, very attentive and nice. Food are awesome. I stayed with my mom in Bellagio for 3 nights. We went there 3 times because my mother (she is Asian ) love it so much."
"The food is fantastic, the ribs, the rice porrage is delicious. All the noodle dishes were good, so good we went twice! the service was great and fast. You'll be pleasantly surprised!! I thought the portions were fine, Everything was fresh."
For what is suppose to be a medium price place it was disappointing.  You don’t get much for your money. We looked at the meat dishes for $20 but you don’t get ANYTHING with it. So we settled for the pork and noodle dish. Mostly noodles. Very little pork.  I wouldn’t go back to this one
"Having spent a lot of time in HK and China, Cantonese is an easy go to when on the road. This was ok, maybe like butter chicken to Indian cuisine.  Mustard and ketchup where served with the dumplings. Probably enough said."
We stumbled upon Noodle open late after a friends wedding. I got a number of shrimp based dumplings. They all had very large very fresh tasting shrimp. The chicken satay and peanut sauce was great and it seems the peanut sauce was made in house. Fried shrimp ball was crunchy and wonderfully shrimpy. Friends got entrees and reported them as delicious but I didn’t try them. I’d totally return. It was a little pricey but what in Vegas isn’t. There is a decent wine and beer list.
"This restaurant, more like a cafe, was always busy, IMHO, a sign the food is reasonably priced [low-mid range] and tasty. 

I had the set 3 course menu plus an add on - 
* spring rolls - basically 2 spring rolls cut in half, not the most tasty
* prawn dumplings [the add on] - they were big and filled well, tasty
* miso soup - lovely and a big serving
* prawn pad thai - 4 prawns, there was a sweetness to this meal, not as much heat as to my liking but very tasty nevertheless

Kind staff and you are able to take food away if you have too much"
"My wife and I had an early dinner here before our 7 pm Cirque Du Soleil O show at the Bellagio Resort. 

We ordered a fish dish, a pork dish and steamed rice. Prices are expensive for the mediocre quality food."
"We ordered the prix fixé option for our late supper. My partner had the tofu soup, veggie spring roll and pad thai shrimp. All in all a good choice which he enjoyed. I chose the prix fixé too. My wonton soup and veggie spring rolls were good. But my sweet and spicy chicken noodles were disappointing. I didn't care for the texture of the chicken which seemed to be a lot like fish. And the noodles resembled spaghetti and were too soft for my liking. Wait staff overall friendly and helpful."
My wife and I were staying at the Bellagio and decided to give Noodles a try after seeing it doing a lot of business. A mistake. The noodles were terrible. They tasted like they were precooked and then reheated. Rubbery. Go elsewhere.
I believe this was my all time favorite meal while visiting Nashville!  The stuffed mushroom ravioli was amazing!  My friends loved their meals as well! Shrimp Alfredo and a personal pizza!  Keep up the great work!
"A little hard to find, but well worth the searching. The experience was great! Staff was helpful and the food was great! I got the Sweet and Spicy noodle dish and man was it right, good heat, and great sweetness. The only down side was I got the steamed short rib and thought it was a dumpling, but it was just chunks of steamed short ribs, the waiter explained when I ordered and I thought I understood but I guess I misunderstood, but they were even tasty. Got a 4 star only because I sat behind a column and had to wait a while to get my order taken."
"Bellagio has two Chinese restaurants Noodles, and Jasmine, we chose Noodles. For us excepting the wait time for our table it was a good experience overall. The service was prompt, menu choices quite elaborate even in veg options & the portions quite adequate for two persons. Decor was very well done."
"The food was wonderful! Very authentic Asian , Chinese, Vietnamese, food. A very popular restaurant and usually a long wait but worth it ! It’s located in the Bellagio Hotel , a very casual dining experience . Definitely worth a try ."
"You can get overwhelmed with the choices of food in any one of the Las Vegas hotels.  We were walking through the Bellagio and was hungry for Asian food after eating so much meat on our two week vacation.  We ran across Noodles and had prix fixe lunch, with wonton soup, dumplings and chicken chow mein.  Service was very attentive but we felt a little rushed.  Food was very authentic and above level you would expect, and price was reasonable for what your got."
"This was very authentic and tasted home cooked. It hit the spot and wasn’t exorbitant despite being in the Bellagio. 
Most excellent service and food."
"My wife and I came to Vegas to celebrate her birthday. We don’t have any good Asian food where we live. After seeing a show we stopped here around 8:00 and had to wait about 35 min for seating. 

The hostess was was very friendly and honest about wait times! 

Once we got seated we ordered the potstickers and tempura shrimp. Both were amazing but if you get one go tempura shrimp! Still craving them hours later! 

My wife had pad Thai and I had oriental fried rice which were both signature dishes. They were prepared great and tasted wonderfully not overly spiced or too much soy sauce! Definitely would recommend and go again!"
"I'm in the Bellagio this week (from the UK) and have eaten here twice so far.

My experience, latest just 30 min ago, was very good.

Warm greeting at the front desk, very fast and efficient waiter service, food delivered quickly and no complaints at all about my entire meal.

I fully accept you can have issues at any restaurant but, despite the recent negative reviews/comments, that hasn't been my experience.  

I have also eaten here many times during my last 6 annual Vegas Holidays.

Just my humble opinion........."
"Standard Noodle affair and very popular. Its a shame that even though you pay a lot to stay in the Bellagio you still have to line up with all the tourists and non hotel guests. They should have a hotel guest line. It was very rushed but food was good, plentiful and tasty."
Noodles was the highlight of our trip a few years ago so we (two couples) could not wait to return!  I will say the food was not as good this time (all kind of tasted salty and similar) but it's still a fun restaurant that can get you full - try the dumplings for sure.
My wife wanted noodles and when she found this place it was our answer.  Little hard to find nestling the Bellagio but worth the find.  It’s a “5” all the way!
"Loved dim sum and noodles here at Noodles inside Bellagio.  Service was fast and pleasant.  We had shrimp dumplings, shrimp and spinach dumplings, chicken sweet and spicy noodles and shrimp pad Thai.  All hit the spot.  We’d return and would recommend."
"I had the XO crab noodles, which didn’t have much flavour and I had to add soy sauce, the rest seemed like typical Chinese food you could get anywhere else much cheaper.

The service however, was very good, and the beer selection was excellent."
"Noodles located at the Venetian Las Vegas is a noisy place. Moreover although we were served by a nice lady, the kitchen was not up to par. We ordered  ongee, noodle soup, and half roasted duck. Took a long time before noodles and congee showed up, and 10 minutes later server lady says there is no duck and asked if we want chicken? Very funny sorry no sorry. Not worth coming here."
"How wrong can you go with a bowl of noodles? Americans seem to be terrified of seasoning and despite the food looking very pretty, it was all fairly bland."
"Service can always make or break a dining experience. This is my first review on TripAdvisor because I couldn’t let others waste a good meal at Noodles. 

The place was empty and we were shown to our table after waiting for staff to finish their conversation at the host stand. Our waitress didn’t offer a greeting, give specials, or offer anything but a snide remark when I double checked our order. Our time at Noodles went downhill from there - rushed through ordering, my son’s meal came out 10 minutes before everyone else, the check was slapped down and that is when the staff became attentive. To the point where they ran my credit card - they had the nerve to circle the gratuity levels that were suggested. I put myself through college waiting tables and I don’t think I have ever given less than 20% and definitely wouldn’t have if someone would have said “thank you” at some point during our 55 minutes in the dead restaurant. 

I was going to ask for the manager, but no one came back to the table after I would’t give them the signed credit card slip. 

Note to the Bellagio - best Mai Tai in Vegas and great pad Thai, but you need to retrain your staff immediately - they were horrible!"
"Went here on our last night much to our regret. We were “plonked” down at a table near the entrance with uncomfortable wooden seats, with the menu was “dumped” on the table and drink order demanded. I ordered diet coke and margarita for my wife. Off scurred the waiter and returned 5 minutes later. The margarita was fine but the diet coke was flat and I rejected it. The waiter returned with a “new” one which wasnt much better. We ordered tempura vegtables and ribs as starters with Kung Pao chicken and Chicken chow mein for mains. The appetisers were delivered very quickly as though pre cooked. The taste for both was bland and the ribs fatty which turned out to be a theme as it was the same for the mains. As soon as mains were delivered so was the check.Its as though they wanted us out as soon as possible and not interested in any complaints or customer service. We left no tip, thinking our local chinese takeaway could produce better offerings at a cheaper price. Overall poor quality food, high prices and poor customer service. Will not be returning."
"We went to Noodles restaurant whilst in Vegas a few weeks ago. Only a short wait to get seated, our order was taken quickly and our starters came within 10-15 minutes. Our main courses didn't take long after we finished our starters and were delicious. I had sweet and sour chicken which was lovely but a big portion so I struggled to finish it! Both the food and service were good during our visit, I'd recommend giving it a try :)"
"We stayed at the Bellagio for an event and ate at Noodles and other restaurants in the hotel and outside. We found the food and presentation at Noodles enjoyable.

We ate light that night. We started with Shiui Mai. There were delicious. Then followed it with the Crispy Shrimp Balls. Possibly the best balls in the country. We never had any that were better.

For the main dish, we had the Hong Kong Egg Noodles and for a healthy side, Streamed vegetables. We drank that down with the Oolong Tea.

I recommend this restaurant. The food was very good as well as the Service."
I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai after a night out and it was absolutely amazing. It was one of the best pad thai I have had. The hostess was kind when taking our order and we quickly recieved our food. Since it was late at night (after 1am) it wasn't very crowded.
Appetiser arrived within 2 mins of ordering so must have been precooked and they brought out the main 2 mins later. Didn’t even ask if I wanted another drink or dessert before slapping the check on the table. Food was ok nothing more and very pricey for what you get.
"First night in the hotel,flight in was late.

We had to wait in line until a table was available,there were four of us.

The service reminded me of a slick factory organised operation and completely robotic.

We all selected the three course menu, best thing said about that,it was average just.

Will we back during our stay here,most certainly not."
I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai after a night out and it was absolutely amazing. It was one of the best pad thai I have had. The hostess was kind when taking our order and we quickly recieved our food. Since it was late at night (after 1am) it wasn't very crowded.
"WE had huge expectations when we sat down at this restaurant.  Why?, because it was in the Bellagio.  WE were definitely disappointed.  Not because it was terrible, but because it was ordinary.

We were seated fairly quickly (probably should have been our first clue).  WE ordered the Sweet and Spicy Noodles, Pad Thai Noodles, Seafood Pho, and the Pot stickers.  They were just average, nothing special there.  Overall we were not wowed.  WE had the Prix Fix menu option, but did not feel we received a decent value."
"This restaurant makes a decent rendition of a variety of foods featuring noodles.  My favorite was the Dan Dan noodle dish, which is my personal standard for asian themed noodle restaurants.  This was done just right.  Be prepared to wait a little for a place, as the seating is somewhat limited."
"We waited in line, about 5 from the front, for about 15 minutes and it wasn't moving. It was just two of us for lunch, so we thought it'd be fine to sit at the bar. Since we weren't totally sure if it was okay to just go seat ourselves (pretty common at most restaurants), we attempted to ask the hostess. I went first to ask her. She was more skilled at ignoring people that she was at anything else I watched her doing for like 5 straight minutes. She was sure to talk with anyone else around who was also Asian, but not me. I got frustrated and went back to the line hoping it would start moving. It didn't. The other person in my party went and found a way to communicate with the rude (and possibly racist) hostess. She said we can't seat ourselves at the bar and she would offer the seats to the people in line in order. That seemed fair enough. She asked everyone in line and no one accepted. She was sure to ask the Asian people behind us in line if they wanted it before asking us. When she reluctantly finally asked us, we accepted. As we started moving toward the restaurant, an Asian couple ahead of us decided they wanted the bar seats, after all. The hostess dismissed us back to the line again and took the Asian couple who passed on the seats in the first place. We left, and would never go back."
"We were waiting in line (about 20 people long at 1PM) and the hostess said there were 2 spots at the bar, she went down the line asking people if they wanted the seats. When she got to us, she asked the lady behind us if she was there first (she wasn't) but she made it seem like she was allowing us to go ahead of her. We said we'd sit at the bar, at that moment someone from closer to the front of the line came to the hostess and said they changed their minds and they would take it. The hostess allowed them to take the seats. We were frustrated as we had JUST accepted the seats, and she told us, ""well I asked them first."" I told her they declined and we had already accepted. We ended up going to the Bellagio Buffet, which was a win for us--great selection and reasonable price. Will not return to Noodles"
Ate here for lunch two days in a row. Service is good. Food is amazing! The restaurant has a great atmosphere.
"Every time I go to Vegas I have to go to this place for their noodle soup and each time they don't disappoint me. I love their yummy food, any dish you order is amazing. The atmosphere and the service are great."
"I ate here by myself and really enjoyed it.   It’s not cheap....  but it’s very good and I usually don’t expect both of those attributes in the same meal.   The pan fried potstickers were cooked just right and the sauce was good.

I also had a noodle dish....  can’t remember the name but I’m attaching a photo.  It was very good.

The waiter was quick to refill my water and get me hot chilli oil."
"We wanted to have something different.  Since we have been to areas were noodles were a main stay, we decided to have lunch.  Selection was excellent and they had our favorite beverages to accompany our meal.  Do make this at least a one time stop if you enjoy this type of offering."
"A 5th visit to this excellent casual Asian restaurant.  Fresh ingredients, great service and altogether recommended."
Myself & 2 friends recently went to Noodles in the Bellagio. I order spicy noodles & my friends ordered chow mein. When the meals came out you could not tell which meal was which. There was no vegetables at all in either of the meals. They were just dumped at the end of the table. They tasted more like Italian as they seemed to have a tomato base. When we asked for bill the waitress kindly pointed out what we should pay in tips.  As I pointed out tips are for good service & nice meals. Neither of which we got.
"We went to Noodles for lunch as it was located right at our Hotel, The Bellagio. IT always had a line so we thought it was going to be very good. We only waited like 7 minutes. The Restaurant is actually very pretty inside and very well decorated. The food I have to say it was very good and A LOT. We had some to go as well. The service was the only ok thing there. Not that good. Maybe because they are always busy, but it was nothing special.  If they were a little more attentive they would have a better rating."
"Delicious food, honest service and good list of choices. I recommend the Chow Mei with Oolong Tea, that serves 2. 
I also suggest you to ask the dishes to share so you can experience more than one option"
"We got to-go food from Noodles on our first night. It was both delicious, fresh and came out within 15 minutes even though there was a line out the door."
"Menu looked great, so decided to give it a try.

The  seven of us decided to order family style. We had edamame,  it was salted.  Chicken that was somewhat dry, Chilean Sea Bass that tasted and looked like chicken., green beans were good.

This place was overrated and expensive.  Small portions of food for the price."
"WOW !  We have been staying at the Bellagio for years. We have tried almost every restaurant there.  Noodles is right there by where I play cards and my wife plays slots.   It's entrance is small and it looks uninviting so we never thought about eating there.  While playing cards, during our last visit, a couple were raving about how great Noodles was.  I told my wife and we decided to try it.  IT IS WONDERFUL.  We will definitely eat there again."
Everything we had was really good sized portions and tasted really good. The Seafood Noodle soup in particular was excellent with a dash of spicy sauce added!
"I used to visit approximately 2 times a year. It was always good previously. However, my visit in February and June 21st leaves tons to be desired. Service was pleasant - but various apps were unimpressive. 

Chicken satay was formed chicken with what was supposed to be ""peanut sauce"" - but was nothing like any peanut sauce I'd seen before. Kinda a greasy oily sauce with no flavor. The edamame was steamed with no salt or flavor added - bland. The dim sum steamed pork buns were decent - not so much With the steamed pork/shrimp buns. The shrimp skewers were fair - but when priced at approximately $12 for 4 small shrimp it falls flat. 

Hope they figure things out!"
"Dined at the Noodles restaurant at the Bellagio on a Wednesday evening, there was a queue but we did get seated quickly,  Service very good and they were very helpful and suggested food for my husband who has a special diet.  I had the Yaki Udon with Chicken and it was lovely, big portions so I couldn't finish it.  My husband loved his dish too, a nice atmosphere made this a worthwhile visit, they are very busy with take-out too - so another option for people who may not wish to dine at the restaurant."
"Clean small restaurant. Good service and nice decor. The food is very expensive and tasted OK. Mixed vegetable dish was very plan and bland. Toffu was dry and had no flavor. The dipping sauces were the typical hot sauce and soy sauce, nothing exceptional. Every menu item was almost $18; I expected the food to be memorable. It was clean and neat but nothing exceptional. The restaurant was almost full and people were having a good time. I will probably not eat here again as the food was too plain for me."
"Really enjoyed this small noodle restaurant tucked away off the casino floor. Reasonably authentic Chinese noodles, and open late, which is wonderful. The wonton soup noodles are very good. Highly recommended."
"Not sure what it was, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese... Quite expensive for so-so food and minimal decor / ambience."
"We decided to get a quick bit to eat and we're so glad we did. The service was quick and friendly and the food was really good.  We ordered the Pork Fried Rice and the Sweet and Spicy Noodle, would definitely go back if I was near the Bellagio and wanted a quick bite to eat."
"Our group was enjoying the Resort features of the Bellagio and were also looking for a place to eat.  One of our group mentioned that there was s 'noodle' place.  We found it and proceeded in and were seated right away.  We found the menu generous and intriguing.  We all ordered something different beginning with soups.  My won ton soup was amazing filled with homemade dumplings and other yummy things.  The broth was rich and delicious.  I ordered their specialty rice which wonderful; others ordered noodle dishes with meat.  Savory, fragrant, delicious-I tasted some of all the dishes.  We also had appetizers-all so good.  I recommend Noodles if you are in the Bellagio.  Prompt friendly service; reasonable prices."
"I loved the Cantonese Noodle and Wonton Noodle. I generally dislike noodles because  they are not healthy, but man I  loved this place."
"Delicious meal tonite at Noodles!

Roti was delicious and they have added a new spice to the sauce that made it even better than I recall

Salt and Pepper prawns-so flavorful and better than at Wazuzu, and nice big prawns!

Chicken satay delicious and great peanut sauce

Just and outstanding meal very good service
Look forward to returning

Menu is really pan-Asian with Chinese, Malay, and some Korean, dim sum always delicious!"
We ordered lunch here after arriving to the Bellagio. The food was so quick (9 meals) and the staff were so attentive and friendly. The food was beautiful with so many options and the staff were very accomodating to a few changes we made to menu items.
We are going to the same hotel again this year. Part of it is because of this restaurant. It was just delicious!
"We visited late one busy evening. The food was all absolutely delicious. The staff had an extremely demanding couple to deal with at the table next to us, who barked orders at them and never once said please or thank you to the staff. The staff dealt with this incredibly well, and were totally professional throughout. The staff are a real credit to the restaurant."
We came in from the heat and wanted a nice lunch.  We were seated immediately because we didn't mind the high stools.  We ordered dim sum and it was delicious.  The service was lovely.  The food was a little slow in coming out but the waitress sped things up for us.  We eat in Chinatown in NYC and this was very authentic and delicious.
"Delicious food, great service, value for money, beautiful wine, definitely worth a try if you enjoy Asian food.  Dined with a group of friends and they all enjoyed their meal."
I love this place. Not only do they have my fav sake (Kurosawa) but the food is always prepared fresh and perfect. Have the dumplings and Mongolian beef. Sometimes there’s no line and sometimes you wait an hour. Well worth it.
Dinner with a friend. Delicious appetizers and great noodles. The bone in chicken curry is particularly good.  Great service and casual ambiance.
"Fabulous Dim-Sum (weekends only is my recollection).  Authentic noodle dishes from varying Asian countries.  Excellent service, very attentive and the quality of the food is top-notch.  Broth is not from a can, or cubes in boiling water.  Chef does an excellent job of creating the precise and delicious flavors for a wonderful experience."
"Craving Asian, especially Chinese, at a reasonable price for two with enough leftovers for a second meal for both, you have to give this a try.  We ordered a variety of dishes, my favorite was the chicken satay and dim sum.  Polite, professional staff with two carts of dim sum.  The only downside is dim sum is served only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and is very popular so expect a 15 minute wait for a table.  Located in the Bellagio Hotel.  Well worth it.  Enjoy!"
"Dim Sum style- food was authentic and classic to again cuisine. From every day expected to the not-so-known style of dishes made it fun and enjoyable. Pricey, but if it's your first time, well worth it."
I had the calamari and crab fried rice. Both were very good. The only down side is the price. Its good but its not cheap.
"Food and service are consistently excellent. I always order the roast duck, among other things. Incredible! Do not miss the dim-sum. From Friday through Sunday lunch, you can choose from carts the move through the dining room. Some favorites; crystal shrimp dumplings and barbecue buns. However, DO NOT pass up the shanghai soup dumplings!"
"After landing in Las Vegas and checking into our room my group decided to look for food.  It was after 10pm so the options were limited.  We found Noodles.  It was in our hotel and open.  We were forced to stand at the front entrance for a extremely long time.  We had to wait while the receptionist took an order to go from a couple.  She was actually quite rude about the whole situation.  Had it been earlier in the day we would have left to find another place.
Once were were seated the service was quick and polite.  The food was really good.  Even with something simple like steamed vegetables, we were impressed.  
The only reason we didn't go back during our stay was because the front hostess were so rude.  It just ruined our whole vision of the resturant."
We always make reservation just incase it is crowed more than usual. Never been disappointed with the food. We always get a little of everything so everyone can sample the delicious food. Staff is wonderful and quick. They make sure you are satisfied with the meal and had a nice time. Enjoy!
"I think if you took Noodles and put it in most other cities, it would be the best asian restaurant in the city.   The food is excellent here.   I've been to Noodles many times, but most recently prior to this trip was in 2011.   I went back today and was happy to see that their food is still excellent.   I started out with the fried pork pot stickers and they were delicious.   I'm not sure what the sauce they were served with, I think it was a ponzu soy sauce and it was great.    Then as my main, I had the shrimp chow mein.   The shrimp were large and succulent.  The dish was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly.   Service was great - I needed to make a flight and the staff was able to get the dishes out quickly.

I highly recommend this restaurant."
Very bland with basically no taste. Kung pao chicken had some goopy sauce and cheese he noodle dish had no taste. Calamari appetizer was good but very small and edemame was fine but hard to screw that up. Prices were not small. Most dishes were $18 or more. I would not come back.
Loved the friendly staff & the authentic appetizers & meals. My friend celebrated her 50th birthday there and we really enjoyed their selection of Sake.
"EAt here twice during our stay at the Bellagio.

The first visit was a treat with good service and tasty meals.  It was reasonably priced and much to our liking so we decided to visit again later in our stay.

Our second visit was much less satisfying as my wifes courses arrived well before mine and when I queried our waitress she rather flippantly advised that 'things taste better when you have to wait for them'.

Unfortunately she was wrong as the experience left a bad taste in my mouth and the wait meant that my wife and I were eating at different times, else she would have to let her meal get cold.

I would have to be convinced to return to Noodles."
"It called immediate gratification when you walk into a restaurant and get food in your mouth within 5 minutes.  And don’t forget the is really good because it’s dim sum!  We sipped champagne and watched the carts come by with their divine kettle packages of goodies.  The restaurant is located in the Bellagio Hotel, tucked way in the back, signage within the hotel is pretty good.  This place can get crowded so go early and go hungry."
this is one of the last restaurants to shut and is right next to the tables and the main bar....asian menu...thai and chinese...also some Vietnamese i think...perfect for that late night dinner after you have won or lost at the casino...will highly recommend...very good food

"Stayed 4 days/3 nights at Bellagio. Ended up eating at Noodles for lunch 3 times. On the weekend they have dim sum, but overall the menu is Pan-Asian, and we had a bit from each region.

We particularly liked the chicken satay (Thai), the Yaki Udon noodles (Japan) and the grilled shrimp skewers. The sticky rice ball with mango for dessert was excellent!"
"Noodles is a good moderately-priced option with a terrific variety of noodle dishes. Located just off the casino floor at Bellagio, the restaurant always seems to be crowded, but the line moves fairly quickly. On my most recent visit, I ordered from the prix fixe menu, which consisted of a soup, an appetizer, and an entree for about $31. I selected the shrimp wonton soup, the vegetable spring rolls, and the sweet and spicy chicken noodles. The soup broth was hearty with three large wontons. The spring rolls were crispy and delicious. The noodles were a tremendous portion, expertly flavored with just the right amount of sweet heat.

All in all, it was a lot of food and a good value. Service was impersonal but efficient."
"We arrived early evening, 6:15ish I think, as we had tickets to the theatre booked for 7:30. We were shown straight to a table, didn't book, we had a lovely meal, staff were friendly and attentive, nice addition to the Bellagio's many restaurants."
"Fast, great service with excellent Chinese food.  I had the kung pao chicken.  It is accompanied with a bowl of steamed white rice. It is enough for one person with a big appetite or for a shared order.  The flavors complimented each other and the food was cooked perfectly and served hot.  Service was fast and friendly."
"Yeah, sometimes you just CRAVE this kind of food, and when you realize it's midnight and you skipped lunch, this is an AMAZING revelation.  REALLY delicious, way above what you'd expect from, say, a buffet stall or a food court.  This is a truly classy Asian restaurant in Bellagio with a comfortable, casual atmosphere."
"The reason I gave this a 2 is because the food was very good...when I finally got to eat any. I ordered a gluten free dish and everyone else in my party of five was done eating by the time my food arrived. They completely forgot about me and the fact that I could not eat anything else ordered. I got my dinner only because we complained repeatedly. If we hadn't said anything, they never would have figured it out. Consequently, I wolfed down my dinner while everyone watched and waited for me. Silly me for expecting more from a restaurant at the
Bellagio."
"Noodles has been the place for me to go when I am in Vegas and wanted to have Chinese food.  This time we visited 2 times, the dishes that were good were:  snow peas with garlic, shrimp wonton soup, seabass with garlic sauce, shumai, and the egg and pork congee.  The dish that was awful was the honey-glazed bbq pork, it was dull looking (should be glistening), cold (should be room temp), chewy and just like blah.  The service was really good and very clean.  I will not be ordering the honey-glazed bbq pork (Char Siu) if I come back here."
"Had dinner here before seeing ""O"" Cirque du Soleil. My granddaughter and I had the Pad Thai.  Delicious.  We were tight on time and asked the server to please help us get out on time.  It was no problem. 

This is one of many restaurants in the Bellagio.  It's easily accessible from the casino floor.  It's a small restaurant.  We were seated right away but we'd heard about long lines."
great food and always dependable. convenient and so comforting for good Chinese noodles or food. always come here when we stay here.
"The best Pad Thai I have ever had.  My boys loved the Mongolian beef. Everything was delicious. Long line to get in, but totally worth the wait!"
"Called in here on arrival in LV and had a really super mid-afternoon lunch.
The duck, pork and rice was fabulous.....so much so, we cleared our plates and decided to call in again later on our holiday.  
Arrived at a slightly later time this time and the meat wasn't quite as moist as previously although still good.  However, there was some left this time.....
Service was good on both occasions - just the right amount of attention.
Good value for money and will call in again on our next trip but earlier in the afternoon as on our first visit."
"When comparing this restaurant to Noodles Asia with the Venetian, I would say this place has more of a variety and slightly bigger portion sizes. They both have one similar dish 'Schezuan beef bowl' at Venetian and 'Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle'. I would say it is more flavorful at the Venetian but a lot bigger portion size at this location.  If I had to choose, I would eat chose the Venetians.  It's a whole lot better.
I also tried their fried rice, Dan Dan Noodles, dim sum, and Congee. I would have to say all of it was bland, just like there beef noodle stew. I had to add their chili sauce to everything to not only spice (was not really spicy either) things up but also to add flavor."
"Over priced, but it’s Vegas in the Bellagio. Nice waitstaff. Super quick delivery. Mango sticky rice is always a winner."
"Came here plastered. Great food for 2am. I felt like I was spending $20 on a bowl of ramen noodles however, but I did not care. It is there when you need it most..."
You will be amazed at the mouth watering flavor of the food here! Decent sized portions and  a great atmosphere. The staff is very attentive and you will have enjoyed this experience!
"Our food was tasty (Vietnamese Pho, Vietnamese beef noodle, mango rice) but our server Cindy was inattentive and I had flag her a few times for the dessert and for our check."
"We knew that we would be in Vegas during the weekend and would be able to have Dim Sum at Noodles! They only serve it on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sunday so we made a point to get there for lunch on Saturday. There were three couples, we got seated right away and the service is fast, efficient, and friendly. The buns and dumplings are fabulous! We never leave hungry and the price is good for the food that you get. It's a yummy meal and a great social event."
"Perfect spot to have group dinner at midnight. Great selection and friendly staff. Hit the spot, thanks we loved it."
"Food was excellent.  We had soup, hong kong egg noodles, and hor fun. Both noodle dishes were packed with veggies and meat and were absolutely delicious!  The broth of the double boiled soup of the day was so flavorful and rich tasting. It was odd though that the corn in the soup was a small corn on the cob rather than kernels. 

The waitress was so pleasant and helpful when asked to describe the dishes and make suggestions.  

This restaurant is on my ""must"" list the next time we're in Vegas."
Nice and busy restaurant serving very  good chinese dishes. We came to eat here without any reservation and waited so long to be seated because theres a lot of people eating in this restaurant because they serve very delicious food.
"We had to wait for 30-minutes in the middle of the day so you may wait longer at peak times.

It was worth it.

Really nice food with a sweet old lady coming round every 10-minutes with DimSum on a cart.

Would definitely come again and would be confident to bring friends."
"I had the opportunity to try lunch at Noodles within Bellagio and am glad to do so.  On a winter day, it was so good to have the following:  Appetizers - Cucumber Salad, Hot & Spicy Cucumber;  Dim Sum - Shiu Mai;  Wanton Soup and Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodles.  All are wonderful and served promptly while piping hot.  The place was very busy and the service both efficient and excellent.  Don't miss trying Noodles if you are looking for some Asian/Chinese food while in Las Vegas along the Strip."
"Great service and food. We stopped here after arriving and checking in at the Bellagio. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. Prompt drink refills, ect. I completed finished my plate, as did my friends. Delicious. Fairly reasonably priced (for Vegas) It would be a great place to stop in for a quick bite before a show, if you were running late or forgot to make reservations somewhere. Would 100% return."
"This restaurant is off the beaten path in the Bellagio casino.  We have been coming to the Bellagio for over 10 years and I'm ashamed to say that although we knew of this restaurant, we never gave it much attention.  For 10 years we've passed by the greatest little noodle bar on the strip.  Service is very attentive and efficient.  Menu is varied and in observing everyone else, they too were finishing their plates which indicates they too were enjoying what they had ordered.  This will be a regular stop for us now that we have discovered it."
Excellent food and service! Celebrating my sons 22nd Bday and they did not disappoint. It’s in the back of the Bellagio casino. Great place to go before seeing a show.
"My fiend and I went for dinner to Noodles February 3, 2018.  We were seated, and I ordered the low mien noodles, and she got the fried rice.  Service was okay, actually, the lady who was bussing the tables and refilling water was very friendly, while our server made us feel rushed.  Fried rice had no taste, I guess they forgot any spices, Low Mien was delicious and I would order it again.  However, sodas are $5.50 with NO refills.  This is ridiculous, and I will never be back for that reason."
"The first night at the Bellagio we tried Noodles; had the price fixed menu which we enjoyed - very tasty. My husband also ordered the BBQ ribs (saw them go by for someone else and wanted to try); he said they made the meal. I added the XO green beans which were delicious, and also had the mango pudding for dessert which was small but wonderful. We totally enjoyed the food and experience which was something different for us."
"I had read this was THE place for home made noodles.  Service was average. Was so looking forward to my char kway teow - a dish I have had many times in Malaysia, Singapore and other countries. The noodles were nothing special. The flavours were bland and the dish too salty. Missing the ‘caramelization’ hint from raw sugar/palm sugar and lacked balance and sambal hint. 
Expected higher standards - not something I could have got at any local
Chinese cafe."
"Noodles is not the easiest restaurant to locate as it is tucked away at the back of the Bellagio Casino. However, it is worth searching out as the menu is varied and the quality of the food is excellent. 

Service is friendly and efficient and, although we turned up at peak time in the evening, we had only a 10 minute wait for a table. 

Prices and portion sizes are reasonable but wine is exorbitant at almost €50 for the cheapest bottle."
"Noodles has a broad array of Asian -inspired noodle dishes.  We are particularly fond of the spicy noodle soups.  This small restaurant to in the casino, but nicely out of the way.  It is generally easy to get a table and the prices are reasonable."
"We were looking for an easy in and out for later dinner after a show. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and my husband had the Shrimp Dumpling Soup. The most bland, terrible meal we have had in Vegas. Sorry, just being honest and maybe we ordered the wrong things on the menu. Will not waste another $75 there again. Service is good though."
"This is our go to place for a quick excellent meal, prices are reasonable and selections are good.
Their dim sum is also good, just wish they would expand their hours till early evening.
All in all great place."
"If you are looking for Asian food you’d better go to Noodles. Get early in order to avoid lines, it’s not a big restaurant so you may have a while to sit. It’s worthy waiting."
Had late night dinner at this place and loved the food. Ordered Singapore Curry rice Vermicelli and loved it.
"Food we had here was very good.  Had the pad Thai a couple of times.  Dim sum was a bit sticky but had good flavor.  This restaurant is a bit expensive for what it is if you order an entree for each member of your party.  Portions are big so we learned that lesson our first visit.  Share plates, still have plenty to eat and the price is just right!  In fact I would call it a bargain!"
"We are Chinese so we ought to know Chinese food. We ordered Hainan Chicken, said to be authentic but it was not.  Authentic Hainan Chicken is always deboned, rice cooked in Chicken broth and fat, with a touch of coconut flavour.  Rice has to be hot and fluffy.  The Chicken served here was overcooked, tasteless and very dry; rice looked like it's been sitting on the warmer for a while, dry outside with a yellow tint. Wonton Noodles are average @ US$16 per bowl.  A pick-me-up late night snack with only two Wonton Noodles costs US$40.  This place is a tourist trap.  You'll get better Chinese food in Panda Express across from Bellagio, in the Food Court inside Miracle Mile Shops. Visited this place twice until I found Panda Express. No more."
"Reaaaally good. Try the Crab rice, best fried rice I ever had. Also, the plates can be for sharing, the portions are really big."
"Excellent choices , Great food, Great Service 
Selected Kung Pao , Chow  Mein ......shared dish and had enough portions for 2"
"During our short stop in Las Vegas, we had time for lunch before heading for the airport. I researched places and ended up here, the only place I had ever eaten on my day trip here. (This was my second.). It was a dim sum day, but we ordered from the menu. We had the hit and spicy cucumber. It was not too spicy for my 85 yo mother. The kimchi was decent. The Singapore noodles were done right. The Cantonese roast duck was very subtle in flavor, but I think it was authentic.  The staff is all Asian, giving it a great ambiance. We were happy."
"My daughter and I were checking out the restaurants and noticed that Noodles had a price fixee dinner offer, at an extremely good price, for a 3 course dinner.  The food was delicious, arrived fast and hot.  Everything tasted great.  The service was excellent, 
what more can you ask for, and what more can I say, except try it."
This restaurant is very good.  The service is outstanding and the food is fresh and delicious!  Would recommend!
"Staying at Bellagio and wanted some asian food. 

Ordered the chicken satay, dan dan noodles, and a wonton soup to share. Wontons were all prawns! Pretty good for a Las Vegas winter day."
"We were staying in Bellagio for a business meeting and needed a place to eat, we were walking past Noodles and decided to give it a shot. The service was quick, the staff was friendly and the food was excellent. So good that the very next day when we were trying to decide where to go for lunch we ended up back at noodles. The Sweet and Spicy Noodles were our favorite entree from our two visits."
"We ordered the pre-theatre menu with add on vegetable and duck.
The food came rather quickly and they tasted nice.
Food was hot and gave the people comfort feel.
Worth a try if you like chinese food."
"I only gave it an Average rating because the service impacted my overall impressions.  

We hit Noodles at a great time since we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  However, after being seated, we waited for a very long time for someone to wait on us.  There seemed to be only 1 or 2 people serving, which meant we didn't get refills when needed.

The food was great.  They had a fixed price combo selection that was a good deal and what we got was delicious.

Another night I tried to call down to get take out to go back to the room and I was on hold forever.  I finally just hung up."
"My husband and I had a late evening dinner here after taking in a Las Vegas Golden Knights game.  My first concern was with the wine I'd ordered.  My husband I are are avid Malbec drinkers and both of us felt the wine served to us was ""skunky"" to say the least.  It truly tasted off.  I really don't know what may have happened here, but I would imagine that alcohol of any sort doesn't sit around for long in Vegas, so can't imagine an ""old bottle"", but who knows.  There were then issues with our order.  My husband had ordered congee and being Asian, we both know what congee should look like.  He was presented with what appeared more like an udon noodle soup.  The waitress agreed that he'd ordered congee, but then after a relatively long consideration of his bowl, realized this was in fact not what was before him.

Our waitress at this point I think seemed very embarrassed, first the wine, now this.  She was wonderful and sent us both packing at the end of our dinner with complimentary bottled waters.  I'm hoping this was just the perfect storm of weird issues, because truly the food was great and the service friendly and helpful."
"The duck noodle soup ,shrimp won ton soup and pork lo mein were great. The place is always packed and unfortunately things sell out quickly at night."
"Very very good asian restaurant. Quick, very good service although would be nice if they smiled every once in a while. The duck in ginger sauce is great, as is the pad thai."
"The dim sum at Noodles is quite good, and the har gow and shrimp shumai are highlights. The pad Thai entree was reasonably good as well.

The problem here is the service stinks. The waitresses are discourteous and act as if you are inconveniencing them by being in the restaurant. The women walking around with dim sum carts had the personalities of Thai prison guards, and it made for an overall bad experience particularly given the Bellagio level pricing. 

If I were craving Chinese, I'd go to Asia Noodle in the Venetian over this place in a heart beat. At least there the wait staff will occasionally acknowledge you or look you in the eye."
"We went to Las Vegas in dec 2016 and stay at Bellagio Hotel, lucky they have cheaper chinese restaurant in this hotel.
As asian we definitely prefer to eat chinese food, but we scare that we cannot find any chinese food in Vegas, luckily we can find this restaurant in Bellagio, their food are good and not so expensive, but the potion they serve is huge, so it's better to share.. but their porridge is just nice for 1 person, and they serve soy bean milk also.. but u need to go early if u want to dine in cause their queue is really crazy.."
"Really outstanding Asian restaurant.  Dim Sum isn't something you can get just anywhere.  I had pad thai and my friend had the beef pho, but the real winner was the lychee martini."
The food at noodles was ok. We ordered the duck and it was good but soggy. The skin was not crispy or what we expected. The thai iced tea was yummy.
"I have stayed at the Bellagio approximately 10 times over the years. Last visit to Vegas and the Bellagio was about a year ago. During my visits I'd typically eat at Noodles at least once - and it was always great. Until now!

My friend and I arrived for dinner at approximately 9 pm on Nov 10. It was pretty busy but was seated quickly. Having just been very lucky gambling that day I was treating my friend and I intended to have a nice meal. We ordered iced tea with endame (sic) and chicken satay. Asked my Asian waiter (didn't introduce himself so I don't know his name) for recommendations - his response was pointing to the menu symbols that signified recommendations. Anyhow the 2 apps were beyond bad. Chicken satay was tough and overcooked. The endaname was haphazardly thrown on a plate after being microwaved. Needless to say I'd had enough - flagged another waiter down to get my check. Paid for this terrible food and left. Won't be coming back!"
I have been coming to Noodles at the Bellagio since the hotel opened.  One of my all time favorites!  Consistently good food and service.  It is very simple. But very relaxing and enjoyable.  Had the steamed dumplings and the roast pork.  Everything is good...
Nice plece with quite mood . You will love to go there more than once . The prices is in mediom avarege so you can try it.
"We only were able to try a basic noodle dish and some rice dish - Vegas still a bit of a blur.  But this place was approachable, mid range expensive, nice atmosphere but the quality and freshness of the product was 'good'.  I've had better, I've also had much worse.  This was good enough.  Nice place though."
"We have our usual bottle of Justin CS and the special menu + crab vermicelli.  Cannot fault the service food or ambience 

Will go again on the next visit to LV"
"My wife is Asian and she said it was OK, but not like eating her cooking.  Definitely worth the visit."
"Went to Noodles in the Bellagio this evening. It’s very good, the decor is lovely, staff are friendly and efficient. I had shrimp dumplings which were gorgeous followed by beef noodles, my wife had chicken satay followed by beef chow mien. We both enjoyed our dishes.
We shared a lovely vanilla ice cream for dessert. Service was excellent. My only complaint $52.00 for a Californian Merlot is very steep, my opinion."
"Uncomfortable seating areas but food tasty and plentiful. Quite pricey however, not sure I’d go back"
"My wife is Asian and she said it was OK, but not like eating her cooking.  Definitely worth the visit."
"The food served here is fresh and exiting...ate there two nights running! Fed up with burgers and Pizza? Then cleanse your jaded palate ... good food, good service."
"submitted previously. please check.
great place ... reasonably priced .... wonderful service.
they might need to expand the place."
"This restaurant has easy access from the casino and is nice a quiet.  Moreover, the atmosphere was very relax and inviting.  We were seated about halfway back in the restaurant at a very comfortable table with a view of the entire place.

Vicky our waitress was attentive and seemed genuinely happy to serve us.  The rest of the wait staff had the same attitude as well.
We ordered the pot stickers, sake, XO Crabmeat Vermicelli, and Sweet and Spicy Noodles.  The pot stickers were very good, the sake of OK, and both the noodle dishes were very good.

We enjoyed our experience at Noodles and would suggest it to those visiting the Bellagio."
Unfortunately we came in dinner rush hour and there was approximately half an hour wait. However food was very good especially Dim Sum and noodles (all food is fresh and home made).
"Gave this place a try, and glad we did.  We had the wings and Thai pancake for our appetizers, and they were fantastic.  The wings may have had a touch too much salt, but was still very tasty despite that.  We both had noodle dishes and they were very good.  The serving size was also quite big.  It is a little pricey for those options, but given the location it is to be expected.  We would definitely go back if we are staying at the Bellagio"
"Firstly I need to stress that, noodles,in particular, of this quality would be much cheaper in Hong Kong but this is the Bellagio in Las Vegas. 
In any event feeling peckish we headed here late afternoon. We did not have to queue and were seated for four people. All the waiting staff spoke Cantonese and appeared to be ex-Hong Kong residents which we saw as a good thing and were not disappointed. We ordered the Wo Tip as a shared starter and they were excellent; as good as HK. 
All four of us chose noodles including the Wanton and Szechuan Dan Dan. They were fantastic dishes and as a Hong Kong family we loved them. During our meal they also served significant meals as take away presumably to hotel residents. We have eaten in a variety of restaurants in LV but this was the most satisfying of meals. Service was excellent however they did know we all spoke Cantonese and they were very attentive to us."
Authentic Chinese on the strip! Great dim sum served all night! A bit expensive but you pay for the location. This place is real deal Chinese so make sure to hit it up. We walked by the buffet at the Bellagio with an hour and a half wait and then walked right in to Noodles!
"We were looking for a spot to get a quick lunch after checking out of our room at Bellagio...but we wanted quick and quality as my husband doesn't want to waste any meal with all of the great options in Vegas.  Thanks to the ""Dining Guide"" in our room, I found Noodles and noticed there was Dim Sum...Perfect.  We loved going for Dim Sum in NYC when we lived there and Noodles did not disappoint.  Maybe less authentic as others have stated, but I would say ""more creative"" and possibly, for my specific tastes, the best crispy shrimp ever (photo attached, as I am not sure that's what it is actually called) and good shrimp dumplings.  The vegetable egg rolls were full of flavor as well and my husband tried and enjoyed a few of the pork options.  We have stayed at Bellagio several times but did not know about Noodles. Now that we do, we will be back to try the regular menu for sure, and perhaps the dim sum again."
"We arrived around 3pm and had no wait and very prompt service. This was not our first visit and still found it to be consistently very good. We had spring rolls, pot stickers and a shrimp noodle dish, that was all shared between my wife and I. The serving sizes were great for two. The meal was a little pricey, but we both were satisfied and enjoyed our lunch."
"We tried both the Dim Sum and wonton soup.  Dim Sum average cost was $8-9 per serving and wasn't bad.  Soup ranged from $17 and up.  We had the shrimp wonton soup which was OK...the wontons were excellent, however I found the soup base fishy and somewhat bland.  Some of the noodle dishes coming out looked and smelt very good, so i would probably try those if I returned, however I don't think I would rush back."
"Noodles is a great spot inside the Bellagio - they dim sum on the weekends is outstanding - they make everything in house - you will not go wrong by stopping in at Noodles 
Enjoy"
"Ate here the evening we arrived without a reservation.  There was about a 10 minute wait, which was perfect.  We started with the Shut Mai, we both loved them...just be aware, the hot mustard is not routine, it has wasabi it in, which I discovered after dipping my first dumpling and eating it...I felt it to the tip of my ears.  It didn't last long, but I used it more sparingly.  My husband had the Shrimp Pad Thai, one of the best he said he has ever eaten.  My Sweet & Spicy Shrimp Noodles were also excellent.  My only regret is that we didn't eat here with a group of people so that we could have shared more dishes to taste, there were lots of things on the menu we wanted to try."
"If you're Asian, you know you have to have Asian food every other day.  This is an option i would recommend.  They have a variety of Asian foods, mostly Chinese with a little bit of Taipei, Vietnam, etc.  I ordered a bit much for Me, My Wife, and my 10 y.o. Son but i was hungry at the time.  The dim sum is great and they have it available at dinner as well as side dishes.  Very good quality.  We also had different noodles and they were excellent.  The fried rice was good but i would classify as excellent.  bill came to $132 with tip so expensive for Asian food but everything at this hotel is up there.  Still it was good, i didn't feel like we got ripped off.  Quality was good enough to justify price."
"My Husband's cousin brought 20 people here for dinner the other night prior to her wedding. We were sat at 2 tables for 10. 

The service was good, the ambience in the restaurant was nice.  But the food was lacking. 

We ordered the spareribs with yam cube.. and only ate one bite each.  There was no meat, only fat on the steamed bits of pork.  Very disappointing. 

I had the Chicken Pad Thai and found the flavors to be ordinary. 
My husband had the beef with black bean and was extremely disappointed with the red and green peppers in the dish. ( they were so flavorless and bland.) 

A few of the other guests at the table agreed with our opinion of the food being mediocre. So we're not likely to dine at Noodles in The Bellagio any time in the future."
Absolutely delicious food and amazing service. We ended up going everyday for a treat. The beef soup noodle is the best I've ever had.
"The food was yummy but it took nearly 40 minutes for the appetizer😑
Good location and the place looks nice."
"Went to Noodles prior to going to the ""O"" show.  Got the show special which was soup pot stickers and sweet and sour noodles.  Soup was decent, pot stickers were Good, as well as noodles.  They get you your food fast.  Daughter has Soup, spring rolls and bbq beef noodles and all was good.  Prices are about 15-19 dollars for noodles.  They have typical appetizers and asian noodle dishes.  I would recommend it.  Its not really set up as a sit down and take tour time and eat place.  More of a get you in and get you out but classy.  Very good.  Good for kids, but nowhere for them to run around.  Small venue."
We ate at Lago and several banquet meals and this restaurant was our favorite at Bellagio. The decor was nice and the service good. The food was very good and came out pretty quickly.
Annual last day hit of great noodles and marvellous fresh seafood -- and winner all around. Looking forward to next year.
What a pleasure to find a place that was so fresh and delicious at 2:45am...most places that stay open don't quite give you the same service at this hour....but the staff was great as was the food!!!  They are not 24 hours and it is good to know that they do have a final seating.
"The long queue for lunch on a hot summer's day might indicate that there is a never-ending demand for this kind of cuisine. Nothing stood out and for the prices charged there is an expectation of more flavour and precision in the cooking. Walked away, fed and well served, with one thought, ""cooking by numbers""."
"For Lunch we had a BBQ Pork Egg Noodle soup. Very generous portion of noodles and pork in the bowl. Excellent flavor. The Tempura Shrimp is very good as well.
Service is quick and efficient. Seating immediate. Nice variety on menu. Great place for Lunch.
2 bowls of soup, the shrimp and an iced tea, our bill was $53.04 not including tip."
"I've been here few times and my personal experienced dining here is great. The staff are nice, friendly and attentive. Fast service too.
On top of everything else this is legit Asian cuisine, it's tasty and flavorful."
"We had been travelling around the USA and Canada for almost 7 weeks, and I really wanted something plain and 'homely' and visited here for some Asian soup. I ordered the chicken broth which was very plain, exactly what I needed, can't really go wrong with a broth.  We decided to go back and what a horrible experience. Service was slow and it was hard getting attention once seated. I ordered a chicken and noodle dish but upon tasting it I thought I had just eaten a spoon full of salt - all you could taste was excessive full strength soy sauce with extra salt and the dish was very saucy - way too much liquid for what the dish was meant to be. I explained to the waitress and she asked what I wanted to do, so I said I was happy to order the same but to tell the chef not to add any salt separately, not too much soy sauce and to drain the liquid/sauce - no sauce if possible. It came back even worse - the liquid/sauce was now at the top of the plate, everything drowning within and you could tell they just recycled the original dish by adding water because now the liquid was split with a layer of oil and layer of water - horrible. I sent it back and explained I was very upset because during all of this my husband had finished his rice dish and I had yet to eat anything, she didn't apologize or respond at all,  just took my plate away. I was actually hoping they wouldn't charge us anything for the inconvenience, but all they did was remove my meal from the bill which I didn't eat anyway - poor service and didn't even try to make us happy in the end by offering a gesture."
"I was seated quickly it is a clean bright friendly atmosphere.  I asked the server to bring me his favorite.  Now honestly Im not sure if it was indeed his favorite or if he thought it was a safe choice, I was happy nonetheless.  He brought a basil margarita followed by shrip and pork dumplings.  The main was Pad Tai with beef nice flavor although it was extremely mild.  I would certainly come again.  The meal was $47."
"We thought ""Okay, we're really hungry. Look, Chinese food."" Not!  

This was really, really good food with excellent service and reasonable price!  You can taste each and every flavor of your made-to-order dish. A little wait when busy, but that's because they are preparing your dish just for you. Love the duck!"
"The dishes may sound italian, but theyr'e far from. I had pasta pesto and they managed to but cream at the pesto sauce?!?

Dish sizes are small, prepare to order three or four. Prices way to high."
"My buddy and I were playing poker until really late when I remembered this place is open until 2 a.m.

We got here in time and enjoyed some great shu mai and the singapore noodles and the char siu mandarin noodles. 

Also split a nice big bottle of Asahi beer."
"The servers were nice, the restaurant was nicely decorated. My food was alright. I didn't try any noodle dishes which I am guessing is their specialty, given the name of the restaurant. I had the beef fried rice and it was a decent tasting version of the dish, a little bland. The serving size was large. The Thai ice tea was good. I would try this restaurant again if ever in the area, but I would try something different."
Be ready to queue up.  It's a bit noisy but the food is well worth it.  The ladies walk up and down with a variety of dim sums on a heated trolley which are incredibly delicious.  We also had a Vietnamese soup too which was really delicious.
"We arrived at 6:30p and were immediately seated.  We ordered crispy Potstickers, Fried Rice and Spareribs.  Plenty of food for the 2 of us.  The good was good, not great !  The place is small and gets very loud,  It is reasonably priced...for Vegas.  The service was good.  I'm glad we ate here, but I'm not sure if we would rush back.."
"We closed the place down after getting a midnight snack craving.  To the restaurants credit they never made us feel rushed.  The food was pretty good.  Not amazing, but pretty good.  Especially given they were a few minutes from being done for the evening.  We would go back."
Hidden off in a little nook and I noticed it by accident.  Some friends and I decided to go in and we loved it.  It's a small little place but the service is good.  Just enough choices to appeal to every appetite.
"My wife and I ate lunch at Noodles inside the Bellagio twice on our most recent trip to Vegas.  

Let me start by saying this restaurant is superior to the other noodle restaurants we have tried in Vegas.  We stayed at the Palazzo and ate at the noodle restaurant inside the Venetian Casino and it was nothing remarkable.  

My wife ordered different seafood noodle soup dishes - Udon on the first trip and Pho on the second - and she loved both.  We shared different appetizers each time.  The Char Siu Pau was my favorite.  It is a steamed bun filled with barbecue pork.  It is sweet and savory and light.  It is very similar to a manapua.

Order anything with shrimp in it and you won't be disappointed.  They come then perfectly and they are giant.

The restaurant is also reasonably priced (for Vegas).  If you're in the Bellagio definitely give it a try."
"I had the seafood noodle soup, it was a generous serving and really hit the spot after a night out on the town."
"We queued for at least 20 minutes which was fine, our order was taken then it all went a bit wrong, we ordered two starters only received one to be told other one on way & only half way through sharing one starter our main meals arrived with no tact just plonked on table, we said still haven't received other starter, main too soon she just smiled & left mains on table & walked away. We just got on with eating mains & when we had finished they tried to put the missing starter on the table I told them too late we had really finished to remove from bill, very rushed & not very organised. Which is a shame as the food is lovely"
This restaurant serves a variety of excellent dishes.  We ordered the pork dumplings and lo mein and they were delicious!  Will definitely return.  Very nice service.
"Used a comp'd meal here for lunch, everything was good. Not spectacular but a solid meal and reasonably priced."
Noodles offers a unique dining experience and quality food.  Can get a little busy but well worth the wait.
Excellent food and service. The Prix Fixed menu is the way to go. It provides the diner an opportunity to try a little bit of everything. Will definitely go back.
"My husband and I celebrated our 30th anniversary. Stayed at Bellagio for a week and decided to try most of the restaurants on premises. We came here our first night and the waitress was rude and left the premises and never brought us our food.
After a 45 min wait later we received our appetizers. Potstickers were really good.
My husband was very upset so we did not want this bad service to begin our week long vacation.
Believe it or not we came back three nights later. Potstickers, shrimp and wings were outstanding as well as the mai tais.
Better service second time."
"Met some clients, on their recco to eat at Noodles.  Arrived for lunch and the place was packed.  Only waited about 5 minute for a table for four - not terrible.

The food was good, but not mind blowing.  The bill for the four of us was north of $200 and we didnt order one booze drink.  A bit spendy.

I get that we are in a LV hotel, but I am not sure I would rush back.  The value did not fit the check."
"Had two dinners at this restaurant, both were really good. Recommend the curry soup, sweet and spicy noodles, pad Thai and chicken Kung pao.  Service is fast and efficient."
"Noodles in the Bellagio is open somewhat late, which is helpful. The food is very good. I had the noodle soup with duck and udon. The service was pretty bad. My husband got his meal, but it was 10-15 minutes later that I got mine. He asked them to heat his up, which they did, but no apologies. It took forever to get the check and just as long to pay it. I would probably return again hoping the service has improved, but I'm not running back."
This place always has a line so we decided to get a snack there one afternoon.  We both had dumpling soup.  Yuck.  It was bland as bland can be - despite soy and chile garlic sauces.  The décor is ok.  I was amazed that the server was cleaning the table next to us and putting the condiments on our table as she did.  Then wiped down our table and condiments while we were eating!!!  Maybe there are succulent dishes worth the wait in line but I remain puzzle by all the fuss.  I'd skip this one.
"Stayed several nights at Bellagio with 9 friends. After arriving in Las Vegas and being tired and hungry from the travel we all were looking for a restaurant inside Bellagio. We chose Noodles , however, every one of our crowd was disappointed in the quality of the food especially when considering the prices. Needless to say, we did not choose to eat there again."
"After a minor line wait we were seated in this comfortable place where service was alright.

We had sake followed by agedashi tofu that was good and satay chicken that was average

The soups that came next were very goof being a shrimp pho and a duck noodle soup."
We were ALL disappointed in the quality of our food. I had Kung Pao shrimp and they should have called it Kung Pao red onion. Six shrimp and a ton of red onion. To be a restaurant inside the Bellagio it was really a very big disappointment. There 10 of us and none of us will be back. On the plus side service was very good.
We had to queue for 25 mins for a table but then realised the popularity is due to the fact that it is one of the more reasonably priced restaurants in the Bellagio. Portions are large and iced water plentiful but food was very bland.
Came to this place for many many times over the years.  Definitely worth trying.  The service was friendly and food was good.
"Noodles is a casual Asian joint located on the casino level of the world renowned Bellagio Resort. The line waiting to get in seems long, but goes pretty quick. The decor is modern and classy, with a neat little bar area fronting the kitchen.
   Food) Ordered the vegetable tempura as an appetizer, and have to say it was killer. The Kung pao shrimp was very good, although it's not as authentic as I'd like. I'm a Kung Pao fanatic, so I'm probably a little too picky. But it was fresh and tasty. The soup(name?), was really good too.
   Service) I never quite caught the name of my lovely server, which I regret, because she was excellent: prompt and knowledgeable. But even more so, she was very friendly, and charming. It seems as though all the servers were hustling the whole evening. 
   Overall, this may not be the best Asian fare I've had, but it suits the average tastebuds just fine. Minor complaint is the price of beer, at $7 for domestic and $8 import, is a bit steep in a casual setting; But hey, it's Vegas... Bottom line, If you're craving some Asian and especially tempura or noodles, I say give it go."
"quick, open late, great variety and prices are in the middle.  making reservations is a good idea.  both noodles and Chinese food."
"We checked in and needed some food fast! Noodles didn't disappoint, really great quality food at a decent price. Service was good and food was delicious, especially love the constant trolley of dim sum! Very tempting!
We are vegan and found heaps of food on the menu to enjoy."
"We loved our meal at Noodles!  Too bad it was on our last day or else we would have dined there a second time.  Excellent service, tasty food and great variety.  We will come back to dine at Noodles again for sure!"
We've walked past this place a few times and been amazed how full it's been. I don't really know why because when we decided to visit it wasn't anything special. There are better places in vegas.
"Went here for my 'last supper' in Vegas before heading home and boy was I glad I did. The food selection is wonderful and authentic. having traveled to asia I was delighted to find amazing shumai and authentic dim sum. The wait staff is almost entirely from Asia which was a nice touch. The highlights of the meal were the roast duck and green beans. I would definitely recommend eating dinner or grabbing take out from this restaurant. 
PRO TIP: arrive before 7 pm if you don't want a long wait because the space is small"
"Went for dinner on Our last night stay at the Bellagio, the food was nice. We had Aroti with curry sauce very good & park buns & pad Thai which we shared plenty for both of us. Srvice was good & did not have to wait to get a seat, friendly staff,
."
The food was good but service was very slow and by the time our food arrived it wasn't hot.  The meal was tasty though and the wait staff were pleasant.
"I love the Chinese food at Noodles   If you are in Vegas, give it a try.  If you are staying at the Bellagio, it's a must! 
We eat there on almost every trip we take.
The food is fresh, comes fast and we love the wait staff. 
Get the dumplings.  We liked them so much we ordered more
We love their sesame chicken and ginger scallion beef!"
"The only place open at 11pm in the hotel apparently.  The food was delicious & plentiful, only ordered 3 dishes & a drink each which with tips came to just over $100, yikes.  Staff were very accommodating."
"Nothing in Vegas is cheap, but at Noodles the food was very good and the value was the best we found after being there for 5 days. Portions are more than ample. It was so good we ate here for lunch 2 days in a row!!"
"We've dined here a couple of times and while the food is good, I've never been blown away by it. The service is ok, nothing to write home about. I will say that we have seen many Asian families and groups here, to the extent that may influence your choice to eat here. The prix fix/lunch special is very filling, but we've had the pad thai and the sweet and spicy noodles and they tasted the same. It was good, and we'll probably go back because my husband loves Asian food."
"the waiter didn't bring my water and simply tossed the plates at us and said noodles. lol, I wasn't too happy with this visit compared to the last visit."
"Superbly run by manager Marcus from Singapore.

The Chefs Special is to die for.

I could not recommend this restaurant more.

They will adapt a change to special requests.

No booking"
"Overall a terrible experience. Appertisers come out after the main, bad service. Pushy to order and expect a group of 10 to have one person sit on their own. Not returning, would not recommend. Save your money."
"I was very happy to have dinner twice st this restaurant  during my stay in bellagio. I enjoyed the appetizers, including crispy calamari, crab rolls and the wonton soup. 
I will go again if I stay there"
"I ordered some duck, offered boneless. got to my room as a takeaway. it was very average and I spend 25mins spitting bones out.

very disappointing as very pricey..."
"I spent 5 nights at the Bellagio recently and ate at Noodles twice. The Food was excellent and plentiful. I had read reviews and had an idea what I wanted to order based on those reviews. Maybe it is because it is because I am not Asian but on both occasions the server either talked me out of what I wanted or did not order it how I wanted it. Of course I cannot remember what the soup I wanted was but the server said, No! No! Very Strong. He recommended something else and I ordered it and hated it. I asked to reorder and chose a shrimp soup with Lemon Grass. It was wonderful. On the second occasion I ordered XO Noodles with Crabmeat. You could have it mild or spicy. I asked for it medium to spicy. It had no spice whatsoever. I almost sent it back but they had the wonderful spicy ground peppers on the table and I was able to use that to spice up my dish. Another pet peeve is I was a single diner. I chose to dine at non peek hours. The first time they sat me at the counter even though there were plenty of two tops unoccupied. I have arthritis and this was unpleasant. The second time the restaurant was even less busy and they tried to seat me at the counter again and I refused. They relented and experience was better. It was frustrating to have someone not want me to order what I wanted. The menu items need descriptions since communication with the servers can be difficult."
"We stopped in for a quick snack before heading out to walk the strip. We were seated right away and decided to try the dim sum.
Overall the food was pretty good. Our favorite item was the Steamed BBQ pork buns.

The tables are close together so expect it to be noisy. We were seated by a group of pretty crazy people telling stories then jumping up and high fiving at the table. It was all in good fun so we just smiled at each other....cause its Vegas right?"
"I had dim sum on Sunday.  It can get packed and staff seemed flustered seating people.  But once inside, it couldn't have been nicer."
Loved the food. Service was great and very friendly. We were there mid afternoon and it was not busy. Try the coconut shrimp balls. Very tasty. We eat Dan Dan noddles a lot when at home so we tried their Dan Dan noddles. Unfortunately we did not like them and the staff happily replaced them without question for Pad Thai noddles. They did not charge us for the Dan Dan noodles. Great service. Thank you.
I will say the noodles in the chow mein were very good but that's where I'll stop. It was extremely bland. Would have like more vegetables in it besides tiny chopped up carrots. The fried rice was very dry and bland as well. The worst part was our server must have been having a bad day. She did not like being asked questions or delays in answers to hers.
"We come here every now and then.

The dim sum choices are limited but they have a wide array of different noodle soups and rice dishes.  Entire assortment of typical beef, poultry, vegetable dishes.

Good for a basic, albeit slightly expensive noodle shop"
"Had lunch here with my husband during break from the convention.  We were seated right away.  Waited on by an adorable asian lady-service was very prompt.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs-and the portions were very big.  We ordered Kung Pao chicken and mongolian beef.  Edamame and the cucumber salad-it was all excellent, hot and freshly made.  The chicken and beef were very tender.  Service was fast.  Would definitely recommend."
"Good place to stop for a quick late night snack, very busy earlier in the day 
Not spectacular but decent"
"We were in the mood for something different so decided to have Asian for dinner. We found Noodles in the Bellagio. At first we were hesitant but were pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and well worth it. We had the wonton soup (which was a little overpriced), kung pao chicken and beef in black bean sauce. All were fantastic and made with quality ingredients (significantly better than your usual Chinese). 

I would definitely go again and recommend the place."
"Very noisy place, many children and babies. But ok it's casual, so...
But the service is terrible.
We waited a long time to have the menus, and after that to put our order.
1st-The appetizer came with my wife's main course, so it was not an appetizer any more.
Then I waited....a long time, for my order, I asked and every time the waitress was going : ""...it's coming"". When my wife had finished, my food was still not coming.
I didn't want to eat alone, so at the end I had to cancel my order.
They didn't make any discount, they just say that they will not charge me for the food I ordered (but didn't get).
The food we tasted was average, like you can have in any Chinese, just more expensive.

So a very unpleasant experience."
The food was Asian as the name indicates.  It is the restaurant closest to the casino action and it was great for a late night snack.  If we ever stayed in this hotel again this is where I would head for casual really great food.
Was starving after going to Hyde so I grabbed a $20 order of noodles.  Couldn't even eat them.  Could be because I'm used to fake Chinese food and perhaps these were authentic.  But they were just soggy and flavorless.  I was starving too.  Very disappointing.  :(
"We had appetizers and entrees. Shrimp dumplings in the appetizer soup were great. The shrimp chow menu had too many noodles and not enough vegetables. Service was good and we were able to walk right in. 
Frankweberauthor.com"
We ate at the one in Mandalay Bay. They admitted that MSG was in every sauce and every soup. Very limited selection if you're allergic to it. Can't believe they still use that???
"The place is conveniently located inside the hotel. I ordered a bowl beef noodle for a quick dinner. The noodle is decent, but the beef is too hard and the texture is not quite right. I  expected better bowl of noodle given its supposedly focus on noodles. The service is quite decent by the way. But I would not commend this place for beef noodle."
I had the chance to eat lunch at Noodles in the Bellagio. all I have to say is that it was delivious. One Tsing Tsao beer and a bowl of curry laksa noodles later I was like a baby eating mashed peas for the first time. Drooling.
The service is impeccable and the food is good!  You can depend on consistency at Noodles.  We go there at least once every visit and sometimes twice?
"Noodles is a nice respite when you're not looking for a big meal or the buffet. Though the place isn't that big, our party of 5 was seated immediately. They have a speciality cocktail menu with some interesting suggestions and a generous number of dining options. We ordered the potstickers and shiumai to start and both were delicious. Additionally we ordered pan fried noodles, bbq pork ramen, beef stew and the cantonese dumpling soup. The broth was excellent though laking in heat. Once the food came, the server stopped coming by, so getting things like hot sauce or more drinks became painfully slow. All in all it's a decent enough Ramen stop for late at night meal that's not too heavy. I think Noodle Asia at the Venetian is better."
"A restaurant named Noodles doesn't sound like much of a dining experience. Apparently they put their effort into their food rather than their name. Ten of us had lunch here before a round of business meetings. Everyone raved about their food. I had the Hor Fun Shrimp, and it was absolutely delicious. Pad Thai, Pho, Dim Sum, and everything else was really good. Attentive service, as well. I hear that this is a favorite of the Bellagio execs, and I can see why."
"We were wondering around Bellagio Casino looking for a place for lunch and came across “Noodles”, tug in one corner and decided to give this a try. There was a bit of a queue, so, we thought, got to be good.
The décor was very modern with jars of food & ingredients on display along one wall on shelves that goes up to the ceiling. The restaurant has a very delightful and pleasant atmosphere. The staffs were very friendly and obliging.  
We had the Wonton Noodle, BBQ&Duck with rice, Rice Soya Chicken and fish filet congee. To our amazement, the Cantonese style of cooking was excellent. The taste was top class.
It was so good that we came back again the next day to try different dishes. Not disappoint. Definitely recommend."
"One of my favorites in Las Vegas. Great food, superior service and great ambiance. Had the Singapore curry vermicelli which was delicious. Just great food."

"We decided to take this in after we had seen the show at the Bellagio. The food was absolutely incredible. We had the sweet spicy noodles. Very unique; with a sweet barbecue taste to it, but with a real pop. I had it with the barbecue pork; my wife had the grilled tofu. It has just the right amount of shoots in it; and the few vegetables in it are done to perfection! We talked it off with a Thai iced tea; which was absolutely wonderful."
My Mom had congee and she reckons the best Chinese food she had in US. The Duck was really nice and fresh. Price is a bit dear but consider it's located in a 5 star hotel.
We arrived to the hotel after 12am and this restaurant was open until 1:45am.  Good selection of Asian cuisine.
"Food was good. 

Didn't have much vegetarian varieties but food was yummy. One must try this for non-vegetarian stuff."
"This restaurant in the Bellagio gets a lot of advertising, but the food is only average.  If you want to get a quick bite (we went there for a light meal after a show and before catching our plane home), the service is faster than other restaurants in the hotel and the prices are reasonable (compared to some of the alternatives), but the food wasn't that good.  I had spring rolls, which tasted like you could get them at any take-out place, and dumpling soup (which was highly recommended) which was very bland.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, there are definitely better dining options."
"We came in around 5:30 just to have appetizers. Our waitress was very rude. We ordered shrimp tempura, fried pork dumplings, Wing Zings, and Mai Tai', food came out quick and it was great. We wanted another of wings and this is when the real negativity came out from our waitress. She abruptly told us that we would have to wait. She was at another table talking in her dialect to customers and it took about 15 min to get 4 wings. When she came back finally we placed another order for shrimp tempura. We sat there for 23 min and no waitress or shrimp ever came to the table. We asked for the manager and she told us our waitress had left and went home. Not a word not another wait staff to help us. Unbelievable. This was our first few hours at the Bellagio for our week long visit and Noodles was definitely not a good way to start.
They won't get anymore of our money."
"This is only restaurant in the Bellagio that stays open until 2am, so when I got back to the hotel 12 am I was starving and this ended up being the perfect place. I ordered the pre fix menu and the food was WONDERFUL. The dumpling soup, spring rolls, and chow mien where divine. Good, tasty, fresh, and fast. The price is also very fair."
"The food and service at Noodles was terrific and the prices not too outrageous, considering you're in the middle of a resort.

The Chinese Broccoli was some of the best I've had since China Town, NYC. I ordered a very nice soup. Everything was served fresh and hot and staff were accommodating on special orders."
Had a fabulous lunch here!  Very good sweet and sour shrimp and the spring rolls were equally as wonderful!!
"It offers a great variety of Japanese and Chinese food if you are a late eater the Japanese part of the restaurant is closed by midnight. Dim Sum, noodle soups, Chilean sea bass , wok fried noodles, and congee (rice porridge) are part of the offer great for late dinners to replenish energy after party of gambling"
How can Chinese food be wrong?  It can't!  And at the Bellagio this was the first restaurant we went to after we checked in  It was a great experience.  I enjoy my Chinese food in whichever part of the world I am in.
Great authentic asian food that even my collegues from China aprove of. we drank all the Tsing Dao Beer that was in house and asked for special order of more. Beef noodle dish and shrimp dumplings were awesome.
"Title really says it; The service and ambiance was very good and pleasant. Food was very average and I would describe most of the food at the Bellagio that way. Not bad, just average."
We went to at 10:30 PM after seeing a show. Dumplings are terrific... really terrific. I had chicken noodle soup with shrimp dumplings and DALE had a soup with beef in it she didn't like hers because it had too much beef but the restaurant is beautiful and the servers are great and we liked it very much
"I ordered the chicken fried rice and while the food and service were good, the price seemed high. I assume the cost is due to the convenience of being in the casino"
Enjoyable relaxed evening.  Pleasurable food and good waiting staff.  Wait times were not lengthy.  Fresh food and tasty.
"Noodles never disappoints. 

The hostess is always friendly and explains in detail the offerings on the menu. 

The service is very efficient 

I love the appetizers. 
They come to the table so fresh and tasty 

This is a place to visit at Bellagio for sure."
"Made it in time for the dim sum. Wasn't super authentic that was definitely a good change of pace from the standard go to use because I'm always looking for authentic food and flavors. Had the baked chicken buns – OK. Crispy shrimp wonton it seemed very normal until I get the shrimp, It was perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside. The char siu pau - steam p pork bun it was good. Biggest surprise – the cheapest thing on the menu steamed spare ribs with black bean was crazy flavorful – just watch out for the bones! It's all good for me!"
"Great food at a reasonable price....can't wait to go back.  Service was awesome, quick food and we were back at the tables in no time!"
Great meal and service ... a little pricey ... but this is at The Bellagio and overlooking the amazing fountain display
"Our friends wanted to try Noodles. We arrived and on this day Dim sum wasn't being served. We decided to stay, we sat down rather quickly. Considering it was full this particular day. 
We all got the fixed lunch special. Soup of your choice, appetizer of your choice and main course.
We all chose something different from each other. Well worth the $35 each person."
"Mom and I had lunch here for my birthday. Not cheap, but really good food. The steamed roast pork buns were superb as were the Pad Thai and Chow Fun. So, 2 main dishes, dumplings and 2 iced teas cost $73 once tax and tip were added. This might be one of the least expensive dining venues in Bellagio, so it's a good place to consider."
"We discovered Noodles late one night looking for something to eat.  It's hidden away so I did not notice in the past.  

Fortunately, it stays open until almost 2.  I think most other restaurants in the Bellagio close earlier.

Anyway, the food was good, fresh and plentifully.  I had one of the fried rice dishes and my buddy had the Kung Pao.

Definitely good for late night, dinner or lunch."
"The Wonton Noodle soup was bland, but the Hong Kong egg noodles and shrimp pad Thai were very good. I felt it was overpriced but since it was in the Bellagio that was to be expected."
"Enjoyable lunch at Noodles, we ordered al a carte dim sum which was lovely and a few dishes off the menu to share. The XO vermicelli noodles with crab were very tasty, black bean beef was good and mixed veggies were what to be expected. All and all good quality and tastey food. Would come back without hesitation!"
"We have been to this spot many times during past trips and until this time, we were happy. During our visit this trip we noticed an increase in prices in the 50% range so it was a bit of a sticker shock however knowing the quality and quantity of the dishes we were ok with the new pricing. Now the disappointment comes, the dishes were smaller than in the past, food was 'just' warm and they even charge for the Chinese tea. On our recommendation 2 other couples came with us and they disappointed in the amount of food served for the price. This visit is our last to this location."
"The restaurant is located inside Bellagio casino, we went there for quick lunch, no waiting line. But the food was tasteless. The beef penang fried kwey tiaw is tasteless, vegetables spring roll is like what we found from costco :("
"Popped in here twice over the course of a week.  Fantastic selection of Chinese food.  I love the lady that comes round with a fresh trolley of dumpling selections for you.  Food was frehly cooked & great in flavour. the staff are more than happy to help you with your choices, also.  

Would come here again."
"Had dinner with the family, wait wasn't more than 20 minutes.  Large tables and had a great time.  The noodles soups are great for a cold, wet evening."
"The lines were particularly long this December but it was worth the wait for hot soup, dumplings, Dim Sum. The service was good but not great. The food was excellent, as always."
"We visited Noodles over the Christmas holidays and waited about 30 minutes for a table, which was good as this restaurant is very popular. Most of the customers were from the Far East so we had high hopes of authentic Chinese food.

Sadly, we were very disappointed. We ordered appetisers and a main dish each, as we normally would. However, the mains were ridiculously over sized and some also came with side dishes of rice we didn't need. There were 4 of us and enough food for 8 people with healthy appetites. It would have been nice if our server had advised us about portion sizes. Food varied from good to very poor. Singapore rice and Kung Pao chicken dishes were good, Pad Thai was nothing like Pad Thai - avoid this dish!

The bill was very expensive for what was a very average meal. For authentic Chinese food, take a taxi to Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast."
"My wife and I prefer to eat small meals so we order a couple of apps or a main and a dim sum or appetizer.  When there is a line we just order to go at the hostess stand and bring it to our room.  Take out or dine in service is prompt and accommodating..  

My favorite dish is the Hong Kong chow mein.   I only order this when dining in.  They put just enough sauce to be moist and flavorful while there are still some crisp noodles to the last bite.

My wife loved the udon noodle soup with barbecued pork.  We got this one to go and they keep the pork and noodles separate from the broth.  The noodle and pork portion was very generous.  she's not a big meat eater, so I ended up with 3/4 of the pork which was crispy, moist and tender at the same time if you can believe it.  

I love dim sum and the pork buns are  delicate and meaty, the sesame balls with lotus seed paste were sweet and flavorful, the shrimp balls were unlike any I've had before at dim sum and great.  I'm looking forward to trying the Sui Mai, and har gow before I leave.

Our go to appetizers are the  roti prada  and fried pork potstickers which we have enjoyed several times."
"Having stayed at the Bellagio we decided to pop in one evening so queued up.  It does get very very busy and sometimes we have seen the queue stretch a fair distance and the wait time can be 30-45 minutes.  It is however worth the wait if you only see a handful of people queuing like we did one evening.

The menu is quite literally what you would expect and the prices are very reasonable also.  The staff are amazing, very attentive and quick in seating you (once passed the queue), taking and bringing over your drinks order.

The food is very good, you won't be disappointed here.  We'll definitely go back next time we're in town, but only again if we manage to see a smaller queue. 

I know it's late to eat but we went at around 21:30.  Having said that most nights we were still up at 1am so it didn't work out too much of an inconvenience for us."
4 of us visited here and all of us really enjoyed our meals. Great starters and tasty mains. Also all at a very reasonable price.
"Many interesting options in menu, good and rich portions of noodles. Location is modern, clean and simple."
"One of the best Asian Restaurants in Las Vegas - they have Dim Sum on Friday - Sunday from 11am - 3pm and it is fantastic 
Their menu items are awesome and portions are large - what a great find 
Enjoy"
"Good Dim sums, we tried, pork and shrimps, 2 types of noodles,  1 fried rice and vegetables tray. . They have lot's of different kind of Asian beers. Recommended for Lunch"
"Food was great and fast but waitress kept disappearing.... for great lengths of time....
Prices were fair and not to high!"
Food wasn't good taste special mine Vietnamese noodle too much noodle without seafood. Service wasn't good at all.
"Most people don't appreciate good Chinese food. We are used to the run of the mill MSg'd to death dinners that we accept just for a change of pace.
Well this Chinese food is far from the average. The service is exceptional but the food tastes fresh with hints of exotic spices and a soft flaky rice that is almost like snow flakes. If you can only eat Chinese food at one place this is it."
"A quick stop for an early dinner and we were not disappointed.
Quick service, great authentic food, great choices, and the chef offered to make our dishes slightly more spicy which was nice.
Good atmosphere and would return."
"We stayed at the Bellagio 2 nights, we had such a great dining experience the first night, we went back again the next night.  All 4 diners had the same thing to say about the food and the service - outstanding!  All of the dishes we had were so fresh, tasty, and made you want more even when we were full.  We'll be back for sure."
It's a good place to get a fast but healthy not really expensive food staying at Bellagio in Las Vegas!
Alway a bit of a wait but great service. They will also accommodate requests so you can get it how you prefer. Noodle soup in many varieties. Chicken satay was good but a tad dry. All around tho it was good.
"Five of us are Dim Sum. We ate Shui Mai, dumplings, pork buns steamed and baked. We also tried the fried rice and edamame. We  had great service and great food."
"Visited Noodles at Bellagio twice during our 8 day stay in Las Vegas. Food is great. Both nights included; vegetable spring rolls, seafood noodle and beef pad thai. Fast service, but not a cheap eat. Will definitely return on the next trip back to Vegas."
"Our third trip to this restaurant in Vegas, and it always is a big win with everyone. The menu has typical fare, but it has Dim Sum which is from 11am to 3 pm on the weekends only (check for sure). 

The Dim Sum has a great cart selection. 

BBQ Dumplings are a winner
Fried Rice is a winner
Anything with pork was delicious

Not a great beer selection, but has typical American, and oversees beers, as well as a nice selection of Sake if you are feeling up to it.

Great ambiance and clean, with a very nice staff."
"Try the noodles here.  They seem pretty authentic, are quick and delicious, and are rather overpriced. Recommended."
"Had the noodle one day for dinner very nice  and like everything in vegas plenty of It , had the sweet and sour chicken"
"The Pad Thai was different than I've had before:  It was fine, but not great.  I did not care for the chicken satay - it was dry and I didn't like the flavor  I did not find the food to be worth the money we paid."
"great asian menu....loads of noddle dishes, appetizers were very good...lots of variety to choose from"
My wife and I had a spectacular meal at Noodles. Wait time for a non-reservation was 15 minutes during late dinner service. We were promptly taken care of by attentive waitstaff upon seating. The menu is diverse and met our needs well. My wife chose the Pad Tai and I chose the sweet and spicy noodles. Tempura shrimp was selected for our appetizer and arrived hot and crisp. Our main dishes were delicious - serving size was above average and price was commensurate to its location within the Bellagio. This restaurant was a pleasant diversion from the other establishments within the casino.
Excellent menu ! Very authentic dishes! Great selection. Fast and efficient service! Will be back again!
"Ate here three different times, tried dim sum, noodles, and porridge, all were excellent. The wait times during lunch hours are very long. If you're here during a convention, don't bother going here at noon unless you can get there by 11:30 or else the wait will be an hour."
"Noodles restaurant, like every other aspect of the Bellagio Resort has elegant decor, with beautifully designed wall decorations (jars of Chinese noodles and herbs), china and seating.  We chose the prix fixe pre show dinner. The first course we selected  was fried dumplings. The filling was OK but the dough was somewhat chewy especially when compared to the silky dough covering the extraordinary dumplings found at numerous dumpling houses in New York City's Chinatown.  Next we had wonton soup.  The broth was rich and delicious but unlike the wontons that I am familiar with these were filled with rather bland tasting minced shrimp.  Our main courses were also surprises although pleasant ones. The chicken chow mein was delicious but a far cry from the dish I am used to. This was a soft noodle dish, loaded with chicken but with almost no vegetables.  The other main dish that we chose was a spicy noodle dish, with lots of tender sliced beef. The meal was worth repeating.  Popoo"
"after TAO or NUBO
its not to wright about
service is poor and food is -6 
better to pay the extra and go to tao or nubo"
This restaurant has great food that is priced well.  There are no reservations and it is open late. Service is very good and there are a variety of dishes and appetizers.  I had shrimp pad tai and beef sweet and spicy noodle dishes.  Highly recommend this place.
A delicious dinner at a very good price. The service was friendly and efficient. Best deal we found in the Bellagio.
We were hungry for noodles so this was the perfect fit. Each dish was perfectly delish but for three of us the bill was $70 and we drank water. So kinda pricey for noodles but yummy.
"Very popular restaurant. Went in when it opened at 11 and it was almost full within half an hour.  Had a great lunch there.  Did not want a buffet, after which we'd feel stuffed, so this was a great choice."
"This was a late evening stop,  two of our dishes were under cooked and gummy and gritty.  Inedible to be honest, the other two noodle dishes were very good.  But overall, $95 for two people with no drinks, it was a horrible value.  Would not recommend at all."
We picked noodles because I wanted a vegetarian choice.  There were a few here and the tofu with bok choy and mushrooms was great. We got it to go.
"After a long day of travel, DH and I opted to eat in the Bellagio our first night. The vegetable tempura was delicious and good value. DH ordered a seafood noodle soup and I ordered a bbq pork noodle soup. Both soups had good flavour and plenty of ""meat"", but for the price, were a little small. Service was good and we did enjoy the food, so based on what we ate, we would recommend."
"great food at a good price, very friendly staff  easy to get to food is fresh an taste great everyone is very helpful"
"Small cozy place. Service was very good with waiters attentive to us. There's no bathroom so you have to walk across the casino to find one.  I had lunch there and ordered the pad thai,  unfortunately not the best I've had."
"In touring Bellagio we decided to try the Noodles for dinner.  Their food was very tasty with healthy options.  Also on Sunday they serve dim sum.  I had sweet and spicy noodles with chicken, which had a good chili spiced kick.  My husband had a pasta dish with shrimp and mushrooms. The portions are large and could be shared between 2 diners.  The decor is very modern.  Had a wonderful conversation with a British couple who visits every year and eats several times at this restaurant.  The server was efficient and mindful of my mushroom allergy."
"Reasonable price for a good but not amazing Asian restaurant. I had the Thai and lemon grass shrimp noodles and it was definitely delicious, but in a foodie town like Vegas it was a good not great restaurant choice. Also, they do not do reservations, you can tell it's a quick and high turn over kind of meal (food comes out quick), so if you are looking for a romantic dinning experience this is not the restaurant for you (we went there for a quick meal before seeing the cirque show O and it was perfect time frame for that, we were done dinner in under an hour including ordering an appetizer). If you are looking for a more fine dinning/great noodle experience you might want to try Beijing Noodle No. 9 next door at Ceasers Palace (disclaimer I did not dine there) but I hear great things about that restaurant."
One of the best Asian restaurants in Vegas! Awesome pho! Awesome Pad Thai! Have been here many times! Love it!
"We loved Noodles - very nice menu and delicious food.  We loved it so much we went back a second time for lunch - dinner the first night.  We had the vegetable egg rolls, calamari, Fish Soup, ma po tofu (our absolute favorite!!).  Very nice wait staff both days - very informative and friendly.  The food was just so yummy - thanks for a great dining experience!"
"Not to impressed sorry. Starters came separately and so my Wife had eaten hers by the time I got mine. 
The main course Singapore vermicelli went cold immediately . Plates were freezing cold. Simply put Plates need to be hot to keep food hot."
From the Dim Sum to Steamed Buns to Vietnamese Pho all was perfectly delicious and plentiful! Definitely requires a return visit.
Very disappointing.Staff very unfriendly. Had to send 2 dishes back as one was so overcooked it was like concrete. I have had better Pad Thai in a food court. I cannot recommend
"Just missed it for us , on every level. Maybe it's the American version of Asian eating , just didn't get it, ribs inedible , main course too large , too everything ...so sadly our worst experience , at an otherwise faultless resort ..."
"What a great meal.  On weekends they have dim sum served from carts, just like the authentic Asian restaurants in many cities and throughout China.  It was superb. Items were of the highest quality and expertly prepared. When we ordered the turnip cake, our cart server realized it was not sufficiently hot, so she ran back to the kitchen to replace it. Wait staff was professional yet friendly. Overall one of the better values at Bellagio, where restaurants can be VERY expensive. If you're expecting Panda Cafe go elsewhere. If you want an expertly prepared Asian meal, this is the place."
"This place is always hopping! Weekends are very busy. Food is served pretty quickly. Nice and fresh with loads of choices. This place is small, you may have to wait 10-15 mins for a seat. Medium price range!"
"Nice setting and went because of reviews and recommendation. It's located just off the edge of the smoke filled casino. The food wasn't anything special. Tried a few items (party of four), but food was less tasty than the low end small establishments."
Very good Asian Noodle dishes.  Food is fresh service is good and accommodating.  The shrimp won ton soup noodles are delicious. We also tried the Pad Thai which was also good.  The tasting menu is a good value for Vegas as well.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting Asian Noodle dishes for a change of pace.
"The food here is delicious. I  really recommend the prefix menu if you're unsure of what to get. It's the best option to try different things from the menu. I had the wonton soup, pot stickers and pork chow mein. All were so yummy. The Lychee Martini was amazing. I love the service as well, the only problem was the long line to get in."
"Large selection of dishes.  Food is OK but not exceptional, especially at the price charged.  Service is friendly and efficient. There are better places to eat at Bellagio."
Noodles is excellent food with a great menu choice. Have eaten then three years running and it is still delicious. Staff are really friendly and are the same year on year. Would definitely recommend it for Asian food in vegas
"Located at the Bellagio Hotel, offering a pretheatre menu. The restaurant looks nice, but food is just food! Not worth the money, tastes like ordinary chinese fastfood. Totally overpriced, like a lot of restaurants in Las Vegas!"
"This has been my favourite noodle/Asian restaurant for years, never miss it and have raved in past reviews. This time it was VERY ordinary, noodles not very good, service perfunctory, and just made the transition from great casual restaurant to pseudo fast food, there is a mass market upscale fast food chain of same name, I think they did it better. I have nothing to really complain about, just not as good as the many times I have taken friends here before."
"We went here based on our friend's recommendation.

The decor is very nice but the food was only okay.  I thought the menu could have had more selections.

We had the shrimp dumplings, shrimp balls, wonton noodle soup and the beef with black pepper/aspargus.  The beef was very good, the other foods were average.

Probably would not go back based on how many other choices there are in Vegas."
"Had to wait in the queue to get a table anyhow expected more from this place as it serves not only Chinese but other pan eastern food as well . The food was good i liked it but my other family members were not happy with what they had so overall experience was just  ok .i ordered a soup and a main dish and to my surprise they served both the dishes together so by the time i finished my soup my main dish was already cold >
 as there is always a queue here so they try to serve the food as fast as possible so the people eat and leave to make place for the new so it is not a place to sit and enjoy"
"Two of us shared a quick lunch of steamed dumplings, spring rolls and satay chicken.  I am sorry I didn't find this restaurant earlier.  We had a great experience and Noodles is on the must list for next time!!"
"Pretends to be a restaurant but it's really a semi fast food place. Service is, at best, indifferent. Choose carefully,won ton soup and other noodle soups, some of the rice dishes and you'll be ok. Way overpriced but you are in the B. Lots of $$$ for very little its their motto. This place serves a purpose if you don't want to leave the hotel."
"I have only been there once, but the choice I made was very good.  I had the Kung Pao beef.  The beef was tender and had a good taste with the seasonings in that dish.  I would return."
"The food was very good, portions and presentation were also great.
Tables are a little too close to each other and the four seats near the kitchen are amongst the worst I have ever seen

Would return anytime in Vegas!"
"Good service, good food, had shrimp dumplings, and Cantonese Duck, both excellent.Good atmosphere, but a bit noisy for conversation.. Tables are a little close for a private conversation"
"Very good dim sum and noodles soups in the Bellagio. Lots of local business types, so you know it's good. Line up moves quickly."
"I was feeling the urge for some good Asian food after lots of hamburgers, prime rib, and chicken dishes. Noodles (in the Bellagio hotel) was a short drive away. I opted for the valet parking ($13 for up to 4 hours) at the front, and a short walk later I was in the restaurant. 

Décor: It is bright and airy, but due to the tile/marble/etc., don't come here expecting an intimate place to carry on a quiet conversation. It's lively.
 
Food:
I started with Dim Sum:  Shiu Mai - 5 large pieces of Cantonese steamed shrimp and pork dumplings. It came with a Chinese mustard sauce to dip it in. Very well done, and steaming hot served in a bamboo steamer. The waitress told me as I ordered that these take a little while (made fresh) and wanted to know if I wanted it first, or to be served when the entrée was ready. I told her to bring it out whenever it was ready, which was 10 minutes after the entrée came.

My entrée was from the Wok-Fried Noodles section:  Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles (Beef). Very large portion. Nice seasoning on the brown gravy/sauce. Lots of bean sprouts. 

I alternated between the appetizer and main dish, which made for nice flavor combinations. 

I will definitely be back since the menu had so many other great choices."
"We've been to Vegas a number of times and always make a point of visiting Noodles inside the Bellagio casino.  Once again, impressed with the freshness and quality of the food, as well as portion sizes.  A good value.  Our favorite dishes include the black bean shrimp  ($27) and the steamed vegetables  ($14).  This is plenty of food for two, as the shrimp comes with steamed rice.  So for under $50 two can enjoy a filling meal."
Efficient comes to mind when I think of our service. We both found our meals to be very good. Servings were generous and the food was steaming hot ( just they way I like it).
"Excellent dim sum and other Chinese food. Not cheap at all, but really authentic (coming from the SF Bay Area, we have a solid reference point for an opinion). We visit Vegas every year and always end up eating here at least once during the stay."
Didn't want to go trailing the Strip for a restaurant so decided to eat at the Bellagio. Nice staff. Friendly. Food was good. Chicken Chow Mein was a hit. Good enough value for money.
The restaurant was nice. The food was good and tea was good.  The waitress was nice and kept checking up on us.  I had trouble finding something on the menu that I would really enjoy.
"We actually ordered from here and brought it back to our room after a long day of traveling.  So good!  Portion sizes are large.  My husband had the pork fried rice and I had the Hong Kong noodles.  My dish was actually a soup and wish that would have been in the description on the website.  The place is pricy, but definitely would eat there again."
"I've eaten at Noodles a number of times and have always been satisfied - but then again, it's always been on someone's expense account. The food is excellent, and assortment of interesting noodle dishes, soups and a general selection of pan-Asian dishes.

My only reservation is the price, which is about 50% to 100% higher than what I would expect to pay in a local place in an Asian neighborhood in CA or even on the East Coast.

To be clear, for a place in a major hotel on the strip in Las Vegas, their prices are not out of line, and as I have said I have been a repeat customer.

If you are stuck on the strip and want Asian food, this one is good."
"One word...delicious. I went here on a Sunday night with a couple of my colleagues and I had to wait 30 minutes to get in. I have to admit I was a little disappointed, but the food and service was wonderful. We had Shrimp dumplings, Spring Rolls, Kung Pao Chicken, Penang Noodles and the Bean Curd Mapo Tofu. We had a couple of Chinese beers as well, which were good. I enjoyed this place and will be visiting again soon."
"I had a bowl of Wanton noodle. It was a bit too salty. Just average standard, don't have to go there unless you really miss Chinese food or you have no other place to eat in the midnight."
Amazing dining options in Vegas however this is the best at 1am. When everyone is closing this one is the best! They made everything we wanted and made sure the items needed to be removed due to allergies was done. The BEST DIM SUM there is. And yes you don't have to wait till Sunday to have it. Thank you for another great meal at the Bellagio! M+M Denver
I am only giving it average review because for the price it should have been exquisite! Salt & pepper shrimp could have been crispier. Lo mein was very good.
This is one of the best Dim Sim place I find in the States.  They offer a very good variety of Dim Sim. The Dim Sim are very presentable and taste.
"Meal was really enjoyable, the atmosphere however wasn't great.  
We chose it as we arrived late and we were able to queue jump due to our suite. 
Service was slow.  
Can't fault the food however, it was really really enjoyable."
"I was surprised to see that they have the legit dim sum cart here on weekends with a pretty good selection.  They also have a menu you can order from but I didn't do so on this trip.  The only reason I gave this 3 stars is that it was typical dim sum nothing extravagant like I was expecting for being in The Bellagio and the service was a bit slow and spotty but nothing too major.  What that said, I would give it another try and it is a good alternative to leaving the hotel to go look for something to eat."
"as I'd mentioned in my last review we'd be back for another meal and he we are once again yum yum yum just amazing! we live in Vancouver Canada where noodles houses and Asian foods are in abundence but nothing compares to this Noodle House, have to recomend it to everyone oce again : )"
"A good detox from the heavy buffet etc. Quite authentic, they don't take reservations, quick and good service. Portions are large. Beware if you're not starving (and if you are used to normal portion sizes)."
We recently stayed at Bellagio and had dinner at Noodles. We really enjoyed the food and the service. Food is pretty reasonably priced. Definitely recommend this to all.
"Busy restaurant. Will sit you at counter if alone. Try the dim sum, fried dory fish and claypot beancurd. Portions are super big for Asians. Efficient aloof service."
"My first trip to Noodles @ Bellagio.  Good restaurant - they don't provide reservations (which is a drawback) - but was able to go for lunch early one day and enjoyed the food very much.  Typical 'new' Vegas - it is not priced affordably - but the food is good quality and service was good, too."
"We dined here regularly during our 10 night visit to Vegas. Ding times ranged between  afternoon and early morning - a good place to eat after a late night at town. The food is very tasty, well presented and plentiful. I would recommend the chicken Hor Sum? Delicious. Also, chicken with black bean  and sea bass curry, fabulous. Well recommended."
We had just arrived off our long haul flight and looking for somewhere to eat as we were not very hungry.  We shared on starter and a varied main course.  The food was lovely and the staff very obliging.One of the best meals we had in Vegas.
"Good food and huge portions. Their tofu is amazing and the dumplings are great as well. Reasonably priced and good portions, but nothing stands out"
"with the restaurant being inside the Bellagio Resort, the expectations were already high...

unfortunately - not blown away with the dim sum or overall service (slow and inattentive).

prices remain high but do not meet the expectations."
We visited Noodles at The Bellagio hoping to get a quick and easy meal before a show. The service was quick and the food was fresh. I liked the fact that the portions were not super huge. The food came out nice and hot and the menu had a lot of variety between Dim Sum and Chinese. I would go there again and recommend it to friends/family.
Dropped in before the show and service and food was quick and good. Reasonably priced too. Tried the Singapore noodles and wontons.
"Dim sum is not as easy to find on the Strip as is should be. At Noodles, it's available Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It's not a terribly fair comparison because I'm used to high quality, inexpensive and large dim sum from the San Gabriel Valley.  

It is a cart situation which is very fun (and in Vegas, shouldn't everything be fun?). Everything we tried - har gow (crystal shrimp), pork/chicken shu mai, sticky rice, steamed pork bun - was pretty good, although on the small side for dim sum.  

The service each day was so nice. The women on the carts were helpful, came around often and were pleasant. If there's no time to seek out dim sum in Chinatown, this is a fine substitute."
This place is great for on the go or late night stop.  It's menu is fairly diverse if you love your noodles.
"Noodles were dry, overly salted. Wontons in soup were raw. Very disappointed as it was only reasonably priced but still expensive family restaurant at the Bellagio."
"I visited this place twice in my trip to Las Vegas. 
The dim sum is so good. 
The Har Gow is the very best that I have ever had. 
The shrimp and pork dumpling was very yummy. 

The prawn tempura was crisp, hot and fresh. 

The service was really efficient and very friendly. 

A must in the Bellagio."
The laksa curry noodles were to die for. I'm still dreaming about them! The food was authentic and the menu had so many great offerings - all legit asian style - not americanized greasy. It was really great food!
The Noodles were alright. The menu had a variety of dishes that suits different tastes. But the service is a bit slow.
"We were surprised by the quality and quantity of the noodle dishes. Excellent service, and very clear restaurant!"
"I've wanted to try this place in the past, but it's a little pricey. But what the heck; we splurged!  Excellent meal.  We ordered Shiu Mai and Spring Rolls from the Dim Sum, and followed up with Pad Thai and company had OX Crabmeat Vermicelli.  Everything was excellent!  Worth the splurge!"
I have this Every time I visit Vegas. I particularly like the prawn dumplings and cantonese duck. Quality food in the great Bellagio atmosphere.
"Just sit and experience fabulous food. Nothing changes, exactly the same for years. A creature of habit yes,"
"Having been to Vegas many times and sampled different types of chinese food, it was refreshing to come to a restaurant that offers good tasting chinese food the same as you would expect in Hong Kong. A little pricey but when you want good food sometimes you have to accept it. Staff were friendly and prompt. Couldn't fault their customer service."
"Its a great place to eat noodles, the menu its very nice and its very comfortable. The price is not that expensive, and they close up late so its a good place to eat a late dinner."
"I've asked hor fun and it was really tasty, juicy and fresh. The attendants are very fast as though as the food request. Great and fresh shrimps, surprinsingly beautiful. Very good price."
"Had a great meal at noodles. I ordered the sweet and spicy noodles with chicken. It was very tasty. I like spicy food so it was a little spicy. Edamame as a starter where very good as well. Do not order the margaritas. All though i dont know what i was thinking when i did. This is a noodle place. They are very bad. 

But over all great place to have a fast and delicious dinner."
Food was excellent.  The service was impeccable and the prices were extremely reasonable.  Eat here!!!
"We had a late dinner with my husband , the service was quick and excellent, and the food even better. We had the Char Siu Pau ( steamed barbecue pork buns), and the pad Thai with shrimp.  we totally recommend this place if you go to the Bellagio."
"Ate here late after seeing a show. Had to wait in line for about 20 minutes but once inside had delicious food and good service, a large menu with great cocktails."
"This is a small out of the way gem tucked away inside Bellagio.  Had dinner there one night and then a Saturday lunch.  Service is very fast and a very extensive menu.  Pan asian menu with a focus on Chinese.  Highlights were the dim sum carts on Saturday- you must try the shrimp balls, awesome.  A highlight from both meals was the Roti.  Two great meals, thanks!"
There is a greta selection of food and it is very good. Plus they are quick and open late.  One of the more reasonable dining options at the Bellagio.
"Having returned from a comedy show at the Luxor we were disappointed to find nearly all of the Bellagio restaurants were closed by 10pm. We eventually found Noodles which stays open until 2am, I think I'm right in saying. The setting is informal- feels 'cafe' as much as 'restaurant'- but the setting is quite cute and the service pretty speedy. The food was decent and, as we were hungry, it 'hit the spot'. I would recommend if you're looking for informal and relatively quick in the Bellagio but be prepared to pay Bellagio prices; if you have time I'd recommend leaving the hotel and finding more choice, probably for less money."
The quality of food didn't justify the high price. The service was good though. It was our first visit .we didn't like the food and never went back. There are many other Chinese/Thai restaurants there which serve much better food for the same or lesser price.
"Is a nice place but the lady who assist us was terrible, drinks took forever to arrive had to remember her twice, we asked for her suggestions and ended ordering to much food, had to requests forks twice. Food flavor was very good I am sure having a different server would be a much different culinary experience."
Ate there once because everyplace else was booked last minute for a big group and it was ok. Kind of tucked away. Much better places to eat but it has been there a long time so some people must really enjoy it!
"As you might have worked out from my other restaurant reviews, I have coeliac disease so my reviews are always more about a gluten free experience than a normal review. This restaurant isn't too expensive for Vegas and there weren't many gluten free options but what they could do was really tasty. 
My husband ordered normal food and was really happy with the dishes.
And the lychee martini is delicious!"
"We saw Chef Patrick Lee's ad on hotel TV and wanted to try the Yummy noodles!  Our schedule was jam packed with fancy restaurant reservations but on our last day after a pool party, we thought a hot soup was much needed.    Noodles soup was God sent.  We asked the server if the chef was there and she said he normally comes in the morning but she will check.  Few minutes later, at our table the man himself came to say hello!! He said the word Yummy and it totally wrapped up our Vegas trip with a good note!!!"
"Great ambiance, descent prices, very fresh tasting food.  Good variety of most Asian dishes in a casual setting .  Seeing a show at Bellagio and didn't feel like fine dining.  Noodles was a great alternative."
"When my husband and I visit Las Vegas, Noodles inside The beautiful Ballagio Hotel is always a MUST for dim sum. But sadly, only on weekends.
Yes, pricey...but they use good quality ingredients...and the food is delicious. Very pretty ambiance, Modern in design....but don't despair if you miss the dim sum...all the food on the menu is delicious. There's noodle soups...shrimp dishes and can accommodate 
Vegans. Give it a try, then go and visit the gardens,for special treat and bring your camera. There's also a fantastic Crepe cafe near the garden, with chocolate fountains...bring your winnings here to pay for crepes...lol. Enjoy, you only live once."
The food here was very average and tasted at best like take away food. We weren't expecting anything amazing and just wanted an easy early dinner but left disappointed. We were staying in the Bellagio which is a great hotel so we had expected better. There much better places around.
"After walking around the food court looking for something to eat, I decided to buy from Noodles, and it was the best decision I made all trip, the food was delicious,
my only disappointment was that I found this shop on our last night there, meaning I could not have it again, :(
The size of the meal could easily feed 2, but my advise is don't share it, its to delicious
I would love to know if there are any other outlets around the world, as I would go out of my way to find their food, its that good and worth it"
"Greta place to go fo a light lunch. Great fresh ingredients well put together. Also, right in the middle of the hotel!"
"I love the dim sum at Noodles.  Their steamed pork buns and pork  & shrimp dumplings are delicious.  There's a wide variety from which to select, and everything is nicely presented.  Wait staff doesn't rush you, so it's sort of a nice escape from the noisy casino."
"It's not the most glamorous of resort restaurants.  The seating is a little tight, the atmosphere is a little wanting, but the food is always consistently good, and the service has always been spot on!

We make a point of having at least one meal here every time we visit Vegas.  It's quick and comforting Chinese food with very few amenities."
This is not your usual Chinese restaurant. They are more high end yet still reasonable. Everything is fresh and very well prepared and delicious. You can order off the menu or from the Dim Sum cart. This visit we had the fried duck and shrimp noodles and seafood congee (kinda like a rice based porridge with pieces of seafood mixed in). Also sampled the shrimp dumplings and a pork wrapped Dias from the Dim Sum cart. A really good meal with excellent service.
I'm not a big fan of Noodles/pasta dishes but was very glad to come here. I had the beef with broccoli and black bean sauce which was soft and delicious. The Chicken Phad Thai went down well also. Service was good and the place just happens to have Angry Orchard cider which also went down well. If we were staying longer then I would definitely come here again!
"Open until late hours, great service. Magnificent kimchi! Price was also good. I was thinking of a fine dining restaurant for the evening, but walked by Noodles and somehow changed my mind, and I didn't regret it. I just loved our waiter, who was really helpful and honest and I love honesty in a city like Vegas. Thai-basil margarita is a nice cocktail, if you like sweetness with a spicy kick."
"This place had pretty authentic Asian (primarily Chinese) cuisine and was the ""late night dining"" option at the Bellagio. It was fine for 1AM when we ate (late check in) but wasn't a destination by any stretch."
"Noodles is a quieter, beautifully appointed Thai - influenced restaurant that is wonderful. The staff is very attentive but never hovers. Food is terrific; try the dumpling soups. Reasonable $$. We went twice and it was great both times."
"Great meal with reasonable pricing, good atmosphere and excellent service. I would highly recommend a meal there"
"My husband and I both had chicken pad Thai. I had never had that dish, and he said I would like it.This was the best chicken pad Thai he had ever had, and I about swooned when I had my first bite. Not too spicy, and soooo good! Quick service, and great green tea as well!!!"
"The servers are all Oriental and their authenticity comes in on point when they make suggestions to you about the dishes.

Be honest when telling them your taste. i.e.. Don't say you like spicy if you can't take it."
"This was a dinner that was work related.  The individual that had taken me to this restaurant stated that he visited this restaurant each time that he visited Las Vegas.  While I was not sure what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised after I visited.  The service was fantastic- and the food came out very quickly. I ordered a chicken chow mien and a Mai Tai.  The Mai Tai was $15, and the chow mein meal was $22, I believe.  After tip I believe the two items cost $42 for one individual.   The chicken chow mien was fantastic- and while originally I didn't think I could finish it all, it was so delicious I could not help but eat every bite.  The drink was also delicious- and strong, although expensive.  The waiter was fantastic- while we were here we had no problems at all- everything was perfect and delicious.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine."
We arrived late and after spending tooooo much time checking in we were just in time for some dumplings and wanton soup. Couldn't fault it and were nicely surprised when the bill came
I had a noodle dish that I didn't especially think looked appetizing but was very tasty.  This is a good place to dine at the Bellagio that isn't outrageously expensive and you can get in without too much trouble.
Came here for a quick lunch and although the food wasn't too bad - I was slightly disappointed with it!  The noodles weren't great!
"We hadn't booked but fancied a light bite - great choice, fast service and nice atmosphere for our needs."
"We stayed at the belaggio and hoped this would be as good as it was convenient. Nope. Pretty bland noodles. The hainanese chicken was just so-so. The agedashi tofu we have at our local spot is better than the version served here. Wouldn't visit again.
Go someplace more interesting."
"Every time we go to Vegas we visit Noodles at least three or four times.  The food is excellent.  We have tried lots of different dishes but our favorites are tempura prawns, roti prata, chicken satay, dim sum  and that's just to start.  We love sweet and sour chicken, mongolian beef,  malaysian or pineapple fried rice, noodles, etc., etc.  They also have dim sum trolleys coming round at the weekend.  The staff are very attentive and friendly.  The food is not cheap but then it is in the Bellagio.  We love it."
"My first dining experience at the Bellagio - and it was a good one. 

Got us in quick even late, and the service was quick and friendly. 

Food was great - not amazing (if you want that, go to Jasmine) - but really good. 

Surprised me in a good way. Casual vibes as well, which you want sometimes in Vegas. Recommended."
"Wife and I swung by for dinner. We were quickly seated. The ambiance is pretty nice and relaxing. Waitresses were friendly and attentive. As for the food it was pretty good. I had the Vietnamese Seafood Pho soup. This isn't your typical Pho soup. It was good, but missing some flavor. Some hot sauce and soy sauce helped. My wife had a Seafood pad thai that she said was very good. Pricing wasn't bad in our opinion. Meal for two with tip about $52. Overall, I would come back, but probably will go and try something new."
Friend and I had dinner at Noodles while staying at the Bellagio. Stared with some Dim Sum selections which were excellent. Both of us choose the Pho as our main. It was ok but it was a far cry from a good Vietnamese Pho. It was described as a seafood pho in a chicken broth. We should have taken that at face value as it was lacking any depth of flavor as a traditional Pho. But also shame on them for calling it Pho in the first place. Service was good if not somewhat rushed.
"Expected something extraordinary within the Bellagio.
The wait to get a table heightened our expectations only to be deflated when the food came. Stir fries,veggie spring rolls and the soup was good. 
The main dish of varied  types of rice was a huge disappointment."
"Dim sum was just ok, but the thin, stir fry noodles with spicy fork were terrific.  Fast service with bustling atmosphere.  Quick, cheap and fast eats."
"I have been to many noodle's restaurants, and as this one is located inside fancy Bellagio, I expected something ""more"". The sauce is very plain, so the noodle itself does not get tasteful. There are many better noodle restaurants..."
I was pleasantly surprised it was so good.  It was told to me it was like fast food but it is nothing like that.  It was so yummy and fresh.  I ate there twice and felt both times the food was great every time.  The service is awesome they are very helpful.  I would definitely go back
"We visited Noodles last night and truthfully,  it is another chinese food  restaurant ....BUT  more expensive. I read couple of reviews at TripAdvisor and I will agree with some ....this restaurant is a ""little""  cheaper than other restaurants at the Bellagio....but is still average chinese food.  Would I go back???  probably not...."
"Chose this place for lunch for one of the days.  Located inside the Bellagio. 
Super busy and there's a reason -- the food is excellent! 
I had the spring rolls and chicken fried rice.  My husband the spring rolls and Pad Thai. 
The portions are massive -- we couldn't finish our plates. 
And delicious. 
Service was about a 3 but I think that's because it was so busy.  They were trying their best and still so friendly to everyone as well. 
Come here for sure!"
"We  had lunch here once during our stay at Bellagio. The food was decent - not too great. They were able to make something vegetarian for us. The server was helpful. Not the best choice for us, but it is worth visiting if you are nearby."
"I always stop here when i visit Vegas. I enjoy the fried squid, barbecue duck and, when I'm really hungry, a bowl of noodles with duck. The beer is good, and the service is nicely done. If there's a line, it moves fast and I've never waited more than 10 - 15 minutes. 
Only reason I don't give it five stars is they charge almost $5.00 force a bowl of rice."
Great spot for something quick or late night dining. Fair price and you can get in and out relatively quickly. Have tried several of the noodle dishes and have yet to have a bad one. Would definitely recommend.
"Ya amazing menu and food. Service is impeccable along with authentic asian dishes. For those complaining about cost or price in reviews you must realize it's the real deal and you pay for what you get. Personally we didn't find it $$$. Hit the Noodles house late late Friday night then around 8pm Saturday night. Pad Thai, Dim Sum and Pho soup did it for me 😆. Will be popping in next time we're in Vegas."
This restaurant is open late so you can have dinner after a late show or concert. Authentic food served by friendly Asian waitresses. Very busy and popular.
"It was late around midnight and we were looking for somewhere to eat.  We happened upon this place and decided to give it a go.  We were seated but waited for a long time for a waiter to bring us menus and take a drink order.  The portions were small, spendy and salty. We had some noodles with chicken. Very salty and greasy."
"At one a.m. this place was still churning out yummy, late night Asian comfort food. Their appetizer and dim sum prices are reasonable but their noodle dishes slightly pricey (beef udon $19), albeit amply portioned (for the right twosome one dish could be more than enough). The edamame and pot stickers were tasty but would recommend passing on the chicken satay- even with peanut sauce it was tasteless without any predominate flavor memories. While the beef in the udon were choice, super tender pieces, the true star of this dish were the udon noodles themselves- velvety in texture with the perfect bite (not overdone) and the whole dish had the perfect balance of noodles, veggies, beef and amount of sauce. Clearly this place knows what their doing when it comes to their noodles and signature dishes."
"We wanted a good meal to share that was not too costly. This was the perfect place in the Bellagio. The food was good, the waitress very nice and it was comfortable."
"Very traditional cuisine. Excellent size portions, delicious flavors. Just the way it should be.moderate prices for Vegas."
"This place is good but I would not say that it is super good. Nice interior, huge menu but food was just alright. I was expecting more for the price."
"Many different Asian dishes are served here: chinese, Thai, Vietnamese. Food and service are both good. The main dishes are large and definitely should be shared (we each ordered our own and it was way too much food)."
"We were walking around Bellagio, hungry, but not starving, and we came across this place.   Being that it is Chinese food, it had a great menu and was perfect for us.  We just wanted small portions.  I had the vegetable spring rolls, which were the best I have ever had - they were thin and crispy and not at all greasy.  I would definitely eat here again!"
"Yes, I know congee isn't all that amazing a foodstuff, but when it's made right, it's one of those simple comfort foods that just tastes awesome. We got right in, and enjoyed spectacular service through the entire meal. All of the food came out quickly, as ordered, with our custom tweaks. A nice casual spot to grab some happy belly grub."
I ordered a few appys with a friend of mine and the bill was around $100. Great food but really expensive. The agidashi (sp?) tofu was awesome and our server was very entertaining. :)
I have eaten here before and with all the places to eat in Vegas I keep going back. I love the roast duck rice.  And the beef fried rice is also great.  I ordered both this time and took the leftovers to eat in my room. This is great chinese food.
"We couldn't help ourselves - we went back to Noodles over and over again for the great fresh Asian food and generous portion sizes.  At each visit the restaurant was populated mostly with Asian diners, which always gives me a good indication that the food is authentic (and if you ask nicely, your fellow diners can often make some helpful suggestions)."
Good for a bowl of noodles and American lemonade! Pretty tasty. No reservation required but nothing majorly out of the ordinary. Cha Sui noodles were tasty though.
"While staying at the Bellagio we decided to have a break from room service and chose 'Noodles' for dinner one night. From the outset the service was slow, the food was all pretty tasteless and expensive. We don't mind paying for high quality meals, however my husbands favourite part of the meal was his beer which says it all really."
"I had dumplings and sauteed veggies for a small, late dinner.  It was very good, and all of the dishes coming out looked delicious.  My favorite thing about this restaurant is that there were options at many price points - I filled up for just $17, which is hard to find in the Bellagio.  But I could have easily gone more luxury or ordered more food and kept it within a reasonable range.  Service was good.  I sat at the counter.  I do wish it was the kind of counter where you can see the chefs working.  Instead I was just facing a wall.  I'd recommend getting a table if you can."
"Noodles is a good place to stop if you are hungry for...noodles. They also have other rice dishes and dumplings. The service was nice and the food was great. I had the Shanghai Noodles. The decor was a bit stale, but it was a good stop for lunch."
"No reservations are necessary, although you can have a bit of a wait as it' s very popular.  Noodles is always on our ""must do"" list when we visit LV."
It was late night and not much was open for eating something interesting.  I ran into the Noodles restaurant and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm really glad I did!  The great menu options made it easy to pick several things to try and I loved them all.  The service was quick and friendly and the price was reasonable.  I'll be back for more delicious noodles.
"Third time staying at Bellagio, but first time eating at Noodles.  Excellent service.  Reasonable prices. Get the big bowl of soup.  Outstanding....."
"We had to go there a few times, cause it is open late and we ran out of options, but every time it was delicious and service was great! The best place in Bellagio that is open late!"
"Spacious restaurant beautifully laid and arranged. wide selection of dishes, good selection of drinks as well"
good place for a snack of chinese food. they also have some selections of dim sum. staff was very friendly and fast.
"With this location, you need to eat early as the line can get long.

The food is not horrible but definitely sub-par for the price. They are familiar Asian cuisines but the taste was lackluster especially if you have real dining experience in Asia. 

The wait staff is competent and efficient, most are Chinese-speaking if you prefer to engage in Chinese. Their English is acceptable, however, if you do not habla the Mandarin or Cantonese.

Frankly, this venue is too small for this size hotel while the Cafe Bellagio towards the back of the lobby is too big.

Overall, not a horrible place if you have no other choice."
"We couldn't decide where to eat so we decided on Noodles. Solid choice at the price point. We both ordered the prie fixe. Won ton soup, pot stickers or spring rolls and then a choice of noodle dish for 20 bucks isn't bad for Vegas. Impeccable service. Never felt rushed. Maybe waited 5 minutes for a table but I can see how the line can get long."
"Excellent and fast. Came in for dim sum and noodles, courteous and quick waitstaff. Tucked away behind the pai gao tables on the Bellagio casino floor. Can't smell the cigar/cig smoke outside. Didn't realize until we paid, but you can charge it to your hotel room even if you aren't staying at the Bellagio. Neat."
"I ordered pad thai during a recent stay at the Bellagio & found it to be good, but I've had better.  However, my citrus mojito was outstanding!  Decor & service was fine."
"We visited twice while staying at The Bellagio. Each time there was about a 15 minute wait (it's not possible to reserve a table)

The staff were friendly and the food and the service very good.

Prices are reasonable for a restaurant in a top Vegas hotel.

Highly recommend."
"Have been here twice,, Nov 2015 and Jan 2016. Both times the food was fantastic. Staff are friendly and efficient.   Dim sum was delicious. And of course the pot of green tea is a must"
"It was our last night in Vegas and we had done enough of the burger and steak meals.  I was craving something Asian and we had found this place while walking thru the Bellagio earlier in the day.  They do not take reservations, so I was a little worried, but our wait in line at 7pm on a Tuesday night was maybe 5-10 minutes.  A huge party of about 20 walked in shortly after us, so it is hit or miss.

Our server was a bit distant, but got the job done.  Looking at the menu, the prices were a bit lower than we had been seeing on the Strip, but the sodas were $4 with no refills.  We sipped accordingly.  LOL

The menu was overwhelming to us as Asian isn't a common choice for us.  My husband decided on a shrimp stir fry of sorts that neither of us could pronounce, and I went with the beef mongolian style stir fry.  Portions were HUGE.  Very good value for the dollar.  We were unable to finish either entree, and unfortunately the refrigerators at the Mirage were filled with to-purchase only items, so no room for leftovers..........But alas, we enjoyed the food very much and would recommend/return."
"Obviously I'm a bit miffed not only because of the missed entree but this single restaurant stood out from every other experience at the Bellagio due to its poor service recovery. Sure they took the missed entree off the bill but besides ""sorry"" there was nothing... 
Complementary desert? Nope. 
Complementary appetizer? Nope. 
Complementary drink? Nope!   
Just the bill and ""we're sorry"". 
Sure my waistline can afford to miss a meal but we're on vacation and we wanted to share entrees'. With all the options in the Bellagio and on the strip ... sorry but avoid this place."
"We enjoyed the pork and duck combo.  It was really good, great flavor, generous portion, enough for 2 of us to share."
"Friendly staff, great service, excellent food! We would eat there again. It was packed when we went but we had a great experience"
"Went for a late lunch and the service was of very high quality. The waitress was extremely attentive to our needs and has an incredible memory.

She even went so far as to change a dish because the person did not like it.

Personally I enjoyed every minute of the meal and will strongly recommend the restaurant to all."
This might not be a fair review because we were unfamiliar with the various types of noodles in the dishes and the overall cuisine.  We ended up ordering the Pot Sticker appetizers and they were good and Won Ton Soup that was fishing smelling and wasn't very good.  Wish we had tried a different restaurant.
"Tucked away behind the Pai-Gow tables (no coincidence), this very authentic Chinese noodle house delivered fresh, tasty dishes to our party that were neither wildly overpriced nor whipped up quick-serve style.  Nice winelist, a few good Sake choices, and a full bar made this relatively small restaurant just perfect for a late dinner after a late evening reception following a long business day in town.  Service was attentive, responsive if a bit slower that our starving party expected, but overall a great experience and perfect for what we were looking for. Well worth seeking out for a large or a light dinner, if you're in the mood for something fairly unusual on the Strip.  Will definitely be back."
"The service was terrible. We were waiting in line, and then one family cut right in front of us when we were next, and they took them immediately. Then, we asked the desk lady why they were in front of us, and then she tried to lie to us, she gave up, and then she left. How rude! When there was an open table, they said that they would clean it up and then we would be seated. Nobody touched the table until 20 minutes later! The workers were looking like their diapers were full, walking like 140 year old grandmas. Then, we were seated, and the people that cut in front of us just got their seats 30 minutes after they were seated. We waited for 15 minutes, and nobody even looked at us to try to get our order. So, we left immediately without getting food or drinks. Don't go if you have kids. It's no fun and the service is terrible. I would suggest to go to the buffet across the casino which is 10 times better."
"A trip to Vegas for us is incomplete unless we have at least one dinner at Noodles.  Tucked away in the Bellagio this gem is worth the wait.  You will typically always wait in line to get a table.  No reservations and no ""special privileges"" that I've ever witnessed. The food is fantastic as is the service.  We love this place!"
"The restaurant was busy and we sat at the counter, which was fine.  We waited several minutes to have a question answered about my shellfish allergy, but finally I was given options about what would be safe to order.

Our food was very good, but a plate of steamed dumplings is rather unappetizing to look at and we thought a small garnish of some sort would have made for a slightly more attractive presentation.

Otherwise, our food was good.....but the bill was typical Las Vegas.  Don't go in with a group of hungry children unless you are prepared to spend at least $100 for a quick lunch."
"NOODLES is a Bellagio treasure tucked away in a little corner next to the high stakes oasis off the lobby.

It is one of the best kept secrets in Vegas.

It offers a wide variety of delisicioso Asian fare at a very reasonable price point (by Strip standards) of between $16 and $30 with effortlessly polite service.

I can personally recommend the Sweet and Spicy noodles with shrimp, the Hor Fun with shrimp and the Pad Thai. If you are in a hurry, a colossal bowl of Won Ton soup goes for just over $15."
"I rarely eat real Chinese food, mostly PF Changs, so the selection was great and the food was unique and tasty."
"Noodles was a great place to eat. Asia Fare. Service was excellent, and the waitress was very attentive. The quality of the food was excellent.  The cost was reasonable for a restaurant in the Bellagio.  Highly recommended."
"I do not think take reservations, but worth asking. Queues are always long. Waiting times are a minimum of 30 minutes."
Food is edible..that is the best I can say.. This is no better than your local chow shop at your local area. How it is in the Bellagio hotel astounds me?.i asked for my order 3 times and it never came until I said I wanted it cancelled..then it was ready..nice restaurant to look at..but as they say..you put lipstick on a pig..it is still a pig
The only thing is that it is convenient if you're in the Bellagio.  Otherwise this is a pricey place with not a lot of vegetarian choices - not real ones anyway (everything is sauteed).  Appetizer Malaysian Roti with sauce is good but the Roti is way to greasy - they need to make this inhouse.  The veg fried rice was excellent.
This is a great spot for a noodle dish at any time of the day. We did not have to wait and were seated immediately and that was at 7:00PM. The food was excellent and very filling. Service is professional although it would have been nice if server smiled.
"Noodles restaurant is the most authentic casual Asian food on the Las Vegas strip! The line was kinda long but went FASt and when Anita greeted us ..... she had a 100% positive cheerful smile and was eager to seat us at out recent 8 year anniversary over the Christmas Holiday last weekend! Anita and the staff work great together!! Anita's has excellent management skills coupled with the ability to be comparable to ubiquitous and the restaurant clicks like my Rolex!!! The food was FABULOUS,  delicious and they have the most friendly staff on the Globe! We had the Duck noodle soup and Thai Shrimp Noodle Soup on Saturday and it was so grrreeeeat we went back on Sunday! (extra shrimp of course this time) The bottom line is Anita and her staff completed our 8 year anniversary with a bang and we felt special unlike Jasmin directly across the casino! We wish we were at Bellagio today to enjoy the Noodles experience with Anita & her friendly staff! Thanks again Anita for your hospitality, great food and friendly staff!! We will be sure to dine with you and your team as soon as possibly when back in Vegas!!!

David & Amy
8 Year Anniversary"
"Fave chinese restaurant i always get the ox tail soup , the soup has so much flavour. cant go wrong with bbq pork,duck and soy chicken. Soy Chicken is their specialty. Also recommend steamed pork buns ,and shrimp dumplings comes out hot and very fresh. Everytime i visit vegas i always eat here and best hangover food!"
"Noodles is good if you want a quick lunch inbetween gambling or walking around the City.   A small variety of Ramen dishes and other things, but there are better restaurants in Chinatown Las Vegas."
"Had dinner in this place for dinner with my family in December.

Ordered few dim sum dishes and other main meals and have to say that the food is very good, We love to eat chinese food and feel the chinese food resemble the real deal. 

Would truly recommend this place if you are craving for some good old fashioned chinese food in Las Vegas."
Our favorite place to eat in Bellagio. Trying new places to eat is kind of our thing when we are in Vegas. This place gets two thumbs up.
"Ate here on our first night at Bellagio. Got in late, only thing open. Service was good, food was good, but like everything at the Bellagio, overpriced."
"Took a while for someone to come take our order, but the food was pretty good. Tables were a bit too close together for comfort. We could hear everything the couple next to us were talking about, and it, uh, wasn't pleasant."
The food was good and the sake outstanding. the service was ok but it was close to midnight so people were tired. I would eat here again.
Bellagio has noodles as one of the late night limited options and it is mediocre.  The pot stickers and veggie rolls were good but the rice plates were pretty sub par and at over 20 bucks a piece the quality could have been much better.
"I've stayed at the Bellagio and Caesars Palace numerous times over the years. I always end up here at some point during each trip. Good food that hits the spot, particularly if you need to carb load before/after drinking. It's small so you may have a bit of a wait for a table but the food comes out fast once you've ordered.  Not really a place to linger after the meal for a cocktail but a reliable spot to grab a good lunch/dinner/late night snack."
Something for every appetite in this place.  Great service and even better food.  I tried the Pad Thai noodles and some edamame and really enjoyed it.  I'll be back.
"We have eaten at Noodles a couple of times.  Everything is soooo yummy.

Only one complaint - we sat at a booth this time and the end of the table has one solid wood side and exiting the booth I hit my knee cap so hard I nearly passed out.  Who would design a table like that?

Try the Crispy Shrimp Balls"
"Tried this restaurant for a light meal and found it to be the best at the Bellagios.  Food was so good we ate the last two nights here.  If we had tried it sooner, we might have eaten there more."
This place is terrible. The food was ok. Not really much I can say apart from don't bother. You expect high standard food considering this is at the bellagio. However I felt like I was in a canteen rather than one of the best hotels in the world
"I really fail to understand the good reviews here.  The food is better in my local takeaway and the prices are a lot cheaper too. 

Was expecting so much more from a place at a hotel like the Bellagio!"
BEST DUCK BREAST EVER!!!!  very good phad tai noodles.  But we felt so rushed. They serve great food....just don't expect to savor every bite.  As soon as they served us they wanted us to eat and clear the table for the next people.
Best Hainanese Chicken!!! Long long lineup in a smokey casino but service and food were very good. Large portions.
This is a great quick late night snack restaurant. The restaurant is quite small so the wait is always long but worth it.
"Went to Noodles for lunch while walking around the strip.  It was EXCELLENT!

We ordered the Malaysian-Style Roti Prata and it was AMAZING!  Very authentic taste.  The prata was warm, fresh and flaky.  The curry sauce was full of flavor and amazing.  It was so good we ordered another!  We also ordered the Satay Chicken - and it was also excellent.  

The service was attentive and very good.  I would highly recommend giving Noodles a try!"
They have very friendly service and flavorful food. The menu is pretty extensive so there is something for everyone.
"We ate here for dinner. The good is that we didn't have a reservation and only had to wait a short time for a table. The server was friendly and effecient.  The food was just a little bland. I ordered the crab noodles which is marked as a specialty dish but it was dry without much flavor. My husband enjoyed his duck and a second entrée of noodles -crispy with beef, which had a good sauce and flavor. It's a good spot if you need a meal and didn't plan in advance and are in the Bellagio. I wish I could give 3.5 stars."
"I had a difficult time communicating with my waitress which resulted in me paying $ 4.50 twice for lemonade. No free refills here! I had the xo crab noodles. Vermicelli noodles, onions, and crab. For the price, you would expect more crab but it's light and delicious"
"The food was good, but really nothing special. It felt more like okay, i need to eat, let me fill up quickly so I don't have to deal with being hungry, which isn't really how you wanna think about food. 

The hostess was very rude and almost made us leave. She was trying to be very efficient, but when asked a simple question such as ""how long will it be"" she answered rudely saying well I did just tell you, so if you could be patient, your turn will come. This was about 15 mins after she told us there would be a 5-10 minute wait because no tables were available. We could see a few open tables from the outside door, but that didnt matter. She finally seated us and was upset when we didnt sit in the order which we walked to the tables and instead sat the way we liked, based on who we were going to share entrees with. 

The Shrimp Chao Mein was okay. The chicken pad thai was a bit better, but nothing will really make us come back. The prices were higher than what we would have expected, and nothing was really great about this place. 

Our waitress was nice and she was helpful so that was a plus."
"A real hustle and bustle atmosphere that serves very well prepared noodle dishes, soups, appetizers and entrees along with dim sum presented in rolling carts.

We enjoyed our dishes and I think you will as well but don't expect classic low priced food. Our lunch (with no liquor/wine/beer) came to $40 a person. Our party of nine lingered at the table for over an hour and were not pressured to leave - a good thing!

We'll go back there the next time we're in LV."
"We ate at Noodles for lunch and we were happy with our choice. I got the crab fried rice which was good and my husband got the pad thai which he loved. The service was friendly and prompt and the food was tasty and a good quality. Price wise it was a little expensive, but it is located in one of the nicest hotels on the strip and was a great quality. I would recommend it to anyone looking for Asian cuisine near the Bellagio hotel."
"Always eaten at Noodles. It is one of my favorite late lunch or late dinner places in Vegas. Great menu choices, always consistent, good service, many of the waiters have been there for a long time. Definitely worth to try if you like Asian cuisine."
"The restaurant is a great find if you're looking for excellent casual Chinese food. Who would think in the middle of the nicest casino you can get a dish big enough for two meals for $20. 

I highly recommend it."
"As we were staying in the Bellagio it would seen daft not to visit some of the restaurant's in the building, so as we all like Far Eastern fare we opted for 'Noodles' one evening.

The food was great, with a menu full of choice for all tastes. The service was as good as the food, so no complaints there. The prices were mid range, which is the bracket this restaurant fits into quite comfortably. 

We enjoyed our meal, but depending on the time of day be prepared to wait a while in the queue, that's the only small fault I can find. Noodles was great."
"To be honest, we pick this because it had the shortest wait.  We got lucky in Las Vegas.  Good Asian choices with very good service.  Small, crowded and noisy, but still worth it"
"I will start this review off the same way as my last one, nothing is more disappointing than being on vacation and paying premium prices for mediocre food . I went to Noodles for lunch and what I got was mediocre. I ordered the pork spareribs and  asked about their fried rice if I could get a half order (which some places do) but I was told they only serve it one size . So I got the steamed rice instead , which was fine, cooked well  tasted fine. The spareribs had a decent taste but we're tough to chew and for $17 kind of a small order . Don't think I'll go back."
Always enjoy noodles every time we have visited vegas. The miso soup is very good. Didn't care for the pot stickers/dumplings this time? The thai noodle were also good.
"I come from HK, so have had many great Chinese food. And still I have to give 5 stars to this restaurant. Great congee and dim sum. BBQ pork is also v delicious. 

So so for other dishes like fried noodle or flies rice."
"A typical Asian dining establishment. Mostly larger dishes to be shared. We were very satisfied with our dinner and it came out of the kitchen piping hot. Our server was excellent and we were well looked after. A few dollars more than you might spend at home but, hey, it's Vegas. I would return again."
"Happened upon this place in the Bellagio, gave it a go and returned several times during our stay in Vegas. The service is prompt and efficient, the food was consistently excellent, and the prices ok for being in a casino on the Strip. We are from Asia so take it from us, this place serves great food made from the best ingredients."
"This is probably the best Chinese food I have had in Vegas. There is a good mix of Chinese, Thai and Malaysian food.  The minor issue we had was the service.  We had a party of ten and they could have done a better job of managing the group.  They were bringing out food as they it was coming out of the kitchen so some had to wait and so on.  But the food was good and that was the important thing."
"On the way to see a show, we decided to stop in to Noodles to have a light dinner and were we surprised. Pickled cucumbers, vegetable tempura and shrimp appetizer were excellent."
"I am a huge noodles fan so when I come to a place called Noodles, I expect a lot. The variety on the menu was great, lots of noodle and non-noodle options. The price was reasonable but the food just didn't wow me. I found it a bit on the salty side."
"Great service, great food, convivial setting, easy to engage fellow diners to  compare dishes. The food was prepared and served in traditional manner. Constant attention made sure you every need was met."
"Nice eclectic menu. Good for family. Good service. Food was very tasty and served hot and fresh. Recommend the set menu. Drinks are expensive. No kids menu but noodle dishes are great for kids. It's the Bellagio, it must be good..."
"On our first night at the Bellagio we needed some food and stumbled upon Noodles as we were exploring the casino floor.

We had to queue for about 10 minutes to get a table but once we were seated the service and food was quick and efficient.

We had a starter to share and a main course each. The main courses are huge and could easily be shared between two. 

God place for a quick bite to eat if you don't fancy leaving the hotel."
A little high priced for good but not great food.... Servers are efficient but there was a language barrier....they are very busy.....
"Have you ever been in Vegas as realized - oh my gosh! It's almost midnight and we haven' eaten dinner!'. If that is the case, stop in at Noodles Restaurant at the Bellagio Hotel. This restaurant offers a wide selection of Asian fare, with a wonderful ambiance, efficient service and great food. You will hardly believe you are still in the casino.
So whether you need a quick bite or a meal, Noodles should not be missed."
"First night dinner, lovely food, large portions, good for sharing, nice staff , reasonable price. 
After a long flight and feeling slightly jet lagged noodles was a good choice, not only were we seated upon arrival, the service was also quick which suited us. Plenty to choose from and helpful staff."
"Just had dinner here and was very disappointed with the quality and taste of the food.  Quite mediocre compared to other sit-down Chinese restaurants.  The inside of the restaurant was very clean, but the tables are too close to one another.  If you're claustrophobic, this is not an ideal place for you to dine and relax.  Service was fast, but it's really the food that doesn't make it extraordinary, considering that it's located inside one of the best hotels in the Strip."
"We chose to eat here because we were looking for a reasonable price and the menu is pan-Asian, not just Chinese. Not much atmosphere, but the service was friendly and the food was better than 95% of the Asian restaurants I've visited in the past few years. A good, affordable choice if you're at the Bellagio."
"We ate here twice during our visit to the Bellagio.  The service was quick and efficient. I had potstickers, miso soup, agadashi, and spicy chicken noodles.  I will definitely be back!!"
"Authentic food.  When you see a lot of people of the same nationality as the food that is being served, you're in the right spot."
Made a late call to eat here on a Saturday night and only waited 10 minutes for a table.Food and service was excellent. Only issue was that the restrooms are across the casino rather than inside the restaurant.
"Maybe it was an off night?  Our party of 6 ordered right off the menu - nothing special.  It was fairly early 6:30 or so on a Tuesday night and they did not seem inordinately busy....  Not really sure what excuse I can make for them, but will try to say some nice things.  The dish I ordered was pretty tasty - tofu and mushrooms - not the best I have ever had but decent.  I also tried the Thai Iced Tea, which was indeed one of the best I have ever tried - not too sweet and not too strong - just right.  The price seemed really high for those two items $25 plus tip.  Our server seemed like a really nice guy too.  Now for the rest - of the six entrees ordered the first to come out was a bowl of Pho.  The server placed it a good 10 to 12 inches away from the person who ordered it.  She had to move the bowl across the table towards her - it was bizarre.  The next entrée came out 5 minutes later - appropriately placed.  The 3rd and 4th entrees came out and were placed in front of the wrong guest.....  The 5th entrée came out 5 minutes later - all the while we were trying to be polite and wait til all orders were on the table, but everything was getting COLD, so we started without our 6th entrée.  Mine was cooling rapidly - I can only imagine that the bowl of Pho was quite cool....  Finally, the sixth entrée arrived-  It was all way out of synch.  We were all quite ready to go after this weird service, but had to wait another seemingly long 5 minutes for the check.  I surveyed my dining companions about their food and the results ranged from ""not good"" to ""okay"" - nothing better than that, so with all the fab restaurants in this town - find something else is my best advice on this one....."
"We decided to go to Noodles prior to seeing the Cirque de Soleil show at the Bellagio. Good Asian food spread across several countries including Cantonese, Thai, Vietnamese which made it more interesting. We chose 5 appetizers to share, and it was perfect, enjoyable but didn't have to sit through the show on a bloated stomach. Good value in a pricey town!"
"good food, not great, a bit expensive for the quality of food portions are of good size .. its a hit or miss..."
Went here on my way home from Las Vegas and wish I found it earlier as the food is reasonably priced and the servings are large. Loved it and thank you. I will be back when I book my next trip through travelhotelsbooking.com and you should too.
"We got here late after a day at the outlets and at a show, so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. We were about to give up and go somewhere else, but I am glad we didn't.

We shared two dishes - the Hong Kong noodles and the seafood noodle soup. The HK noodles are crispy and deep fried (you can taste a hint of the cooking oil), not soft like regular noodles, which gave the dish an interesting texture; the seafood broth was slightly less to our tastes, but the udon noodles in the soup were so fluffy it was like eating a cloud.

Servers were prompt and efficient, did not waste her or our time with banter or pleasantries, but answered all questions knowledgeably and fully. Overall a good dinner."
The service was top rate & the food excellent!  They had a separate vegan menu & the waiter was extremely helpful with our order.
"Me and the wife love Asian cuisine, and Noodles doesn't disappoint. Located just off the main casino in the Belagio, it's easy to pass this place by. We especially loved the pot-sticker appetizers, and all of the entree's we have ordered have always been top notch. As far as restaurants in Vegas go, this one will not break the bank, but that doesn't mean they don't offer expensive plates for those with a fuller wallet. I highly recommend a visit to anyone that enjoy's Asian foods, and the exquisite Belagio casino is just outside when you are finished with your meal!"
Good food at very reasonable prices. Our waiter was friendly and efficient and we managed to get a table pretty quickly even though there was a small queue.
"I know it seems silly since it IS an Asian restaurant, but I am going to point out the obvious and say do not eat here if you don't like Asian food. However, I am one that can always find something I like on a menu even at Asian restaurants and this is not one of those places. We came because my boyfriend raved about it last time he came, and he still loved it. I tried his pad thai and was not impressed. I ordered the noodle soup with chicken, and manage to pick out enough of the noodles to leave a little bit less hungry. This is definitely authentic Asian cuisine and he still raves about it, so if that's your thing I'd say you will still like it. Just don't take your picky friend ;)"
The food is excellent and the service fast and efficient. I live in an area with no good Chinese restaurants so this a must stop place for me.
"A welcome relief from overpriced over hyped celebrity chef dining.
Fair prices, good food friendly service and open very late.
Located conveniently inside Bellagio casino and while not great its good enough for what it is."
The food was great and so was the service.  I had a limited amount of time to spend but the service was quick without feeling rushed.
"We ate relatively early and were seated within a few minutes. 

The restaurant (all indoor areas, in fact) is kept very cold, so wearing  flip flops and linen trousers, I couldn't wait for the meal to be over to go outside for a warm up!

We ordered sake, which they missed and we didn't get until at least half way through our meal after flagging them down. 

My meal was served 10 minutes after my husband's, which I don't believe I have experienced anywhere else. 

My meal seemed to have hardly any flavour whilst I was eating, but for 48 hours afterwards I was breathing garlic- I don't know if the artificial atmosphere causes the lack of taste. My husband said his was ""ok"".

Thinking that a restaurant in a hotel such as the Bellagio will be good is certainly a mistake."
"Great place for midnight snack after a show, portions are large, so good to share, especially the soup. Attentive service and good value."
"Ate here for lunch and liked it so much we wished we had saved it for dinner.  The Sesame Chicken was delicious and portions are more than enough to share.  The shrimp dumplings were amazing.  I could have easily made a meal out of them alone.  During the lunch hour the waiters come to you table side with appetizer size portions of various selections.  Selecting a few of those would make a perfect ""small plate"" lunch.  Located next to the casino but quiet and quaint.  Highly recommended!"
"This was our fault to follow the crowd rather than trying to find a good restaurant based on recommendations. We were passing by and decided to join a long line in front of this place. After 35 min in line we were given a tiny table next to the wall, 15 min later they took our order, 20 min later we got our food. You would expect an amazing food after all this time waiting... I ordered their chef recommended dish with rice and it was a massive portion (at least 0.5kg) of rice with tiny pieces of dry meat and some vegetables. I dont think I ate even a third of it. It was really disappointing, such a waste of time and money when you have some many great options around."
"We decided to eat in noodles while we were staying at bellagio resort 
I had laksa curry and steamed dumplings  and we also had other two dishes which I did not take a picture of unfortunately but the food is memorable for sure"
Nice BUT expensive and was not informed as to the size of the dishes which results in over ordering.
"Waited in line for 25 minutes, ordered from their prixe fixe menu. Food and service were very good, although pad thai wasnt spicy. Definitely would recommend and visit again. Coffee was excellent."
My wife and I always book this restaurant when we are in Vegas as it has a good atmosphere and the food is always good. It is a very vibrant dinning room with the option to eat at the bar or on the veranda overlooking the fountains. Service is first class and it is always busy so best to book in advance. We had a slight issue this visit as my rib eye steak was cold when it was served but once I mentioned this to the waiter he was quick to take it away and provide a new one that was perfect - indeed it was one of the best steaks I have eaten. When the first steak was taken away my wife's meal was also taken away and replaced so that we could both eat fresh meals at the same time.
"As this place is so bad I felt obliged to rate from the table to warn those in the line outside not too bothered. 
Service non existent
Food putrid
They even messed up ice tea
But don't worry your foods on its way......
As told by a different member of staff every ten minutes while one of our group waited for their starter.

Avoid like the plague"
Did not esp like the food. Depends on taste. Others might have different opinion. I ordered shrimp dumpling broth. Which I could not eat due to the smell.  So the waitress exchanged it for miso soup. That was better. But I didn't finish it. Then had veggie rolls which were good. And finally beef lo mein which was okay too.
"Expected a little more at the bellagio, but this was just a regular noodle place, nothing real special. Even for casual dining it lacked the little things. Chicken Satay was overcooked, dry and bland. Pad thai ok, but again noodles overcooked. Not very busy the night we had dinner, but the service was a little slow and inattentive."
"I am an Italian food lover so there no way that I couldn't eat at restaurant called Noodles.  This Asian restaurant is a simple as noodles are.  The setting was a bit underwhelming, the menu was to but WOW THIS SOUP!

I ordered the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle with beef brisket, tendons-spiced herb broth.  If you like beef dip sandwiches you must have this soup.

The noodles were udon style nice and thick, the broth I was just amazing that I want to soak in that deep delicious flavor and the brisket... I was sad when it was gone.

I came with wanting a light snack and left wanting another stomach to eat with.

Asian cuisine lovers must come here."
"I stopped by after visiting the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts.  It was Sunday afternoon so I went for Dim Sum.  It is hard having dim sum by yourself since serving sizes are 2 to 4 pieces.  However, I ordered 6 different dishes and had lunch and a snack the next day.  There was a wide variety of items to choose from.  I spent over $40 (with tip) for 6 items.  At home in Northeast Philadelphia, for $40 I could have ordered 8-10 different dishes."
"We came here for lunch as we wanted a place to get food in the Bellagio which was easy casual dining. It was ok and that was pretty much all you could say about it, the staff were nice but the food wasn't great, appetisers were fine as they were all pretty much deep fried but the main courses were disappointing, we went for special fried rice and the chicken laksa soup curry, the rice was had very little flavour and the curry had just been thrown in a bowl and handed out with tree of coriander on the top, that made everything taste of it. The main course were unfortunately not enjoyable. The price was fine given that we were in the Bellagio, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
"We love coming for dim sum on the weekends when we are in town. It is extremely satisfying to sit down and immediately be served via carts a wide variety of dim sum available on the Center Strip. It can be a little pricey for lunch, but still we manage to visit sometimes 2 lunches in a row!"
"We ate here on our first night and I'm glad we did, the food was very tasty and portions as always were big, service could have been a little bit more attentive and quick"
"My husband and I decided to stop in and eat here before a show one night. we ordered potstickers and each a entree to eat. Potstickers were awful, I've had better in a cheap take out place than these things. Then while we waited for our entrees, two of the employees got in a verbal argument in the middle of the dinning room. They weren't discreet at all! I knew from that point forward things were going to go south really quickly. My husband got his entree at least 10 minutes before I even got mine. REALLY? Is it that hard to get a tables entree's out at the same time? The food was bland and no flavor. I even told our waiter the food was not that great. Did she offer me another option for an entree or do anything about it? NOPE. Just brushed if off I like didn't say anything at all. This place is way overpriced for the quality of food you get. Do yourself a favor and just go eat somewhere else."
open late-nice to have quality food at a late hour-nice atmosphere-friendly staff-located close to the Bellagio
"Read a review on this place in Playboy so decided to give it a shot.  You might actually miss this place if it wasn't for the constant line out front.  It goes fast and it's worth the wait.  The food here was so good, we ate twice in two nights.  Try an assortment of items and go family style.  Large portions and very inexpensive make for a great combination; pair it with fabulous food and you have Noodles!"
"My husband and I decided to stop in and eat here before a show one night. we ordered potstickers and each a entree to eat.

"After an early dinner, show and gambling, we enjoyed a late night snack/meal at noodles. The pot stickers and kung pao chicken were awesome. Less excited by the wonton soup we had, despite it being a specialty. Happy I had noodles to soak up some alcohol before bed though. ;-)"
"Great dim sum and fantastic service. The only frustration is that even having a late, late lunch around 2p - the line moves very slowly even if you are waiting to sit at the counter. 

Since Noodles chose to not have a priority line like most of their other casual places do, the person manning the front should really be scouting the line or at least letting people know that the counter is open. I waited in line for a long time before someone said hey the counter is wide open. 

At least I know now for next time.

FWIW Cafe Bellagio has the same issue. For solo diners, the counter is a perfect option and you really shouldnt need to wait in line if its open."
So many choices!  Loved the Noodles and as always I asked the server for a recommendation.  Highly recommend and would return.  Service was speedy and helpful.
"One of the more reasonable places. Tip, order to go and avoid a long wait in line. The flat noodles tasty. Very nice staff."
Pan-fried dum[lings and sesame noodles were exceptional.  Service was excellet.  Sauces were good.   was the food over-priced - YES but it good.
"We arrived in Las Vegas at 11:30pm. We were hungry after a 4 hour flight. After check-in we decided to go to see the Bellagio and eat there. We were told that Noodles was a good restaurant to eat at. We ordered 2 miso soups, 1 chicken stir fry noodles and 1 barbecue duck. The miso soups were delicious ($5.50). The duck was too salty and was floating in soy sauce. The chicken stir fry was a bit overcooked. The service was very professional. Was the food worth $70? Absolutely not."
"It was at least a 45 min. wait in line around 9 pm on a weekday to get seated. I was alone, so they seated me at their bar type thing. They were sensitive and said they'd avoid putting someone immediately next to me to give me some privacy. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was not pad thai. The noodles were wider than the standard pad thai I've eaten in Thailand and a million times in the US. The sauce was a dark sauce, not the pinker sauce. But I assume it was their version of pad thai because it did come with a side dish of crushed peanuts, but no sprouts...The flavor was good, even though I feel it was a totally different dish....I didn't return it because the noodles tasted like they'd been soaked in another interesting sauce, maybe oyster of fish sauce....A large pot of tea for 2 people was $5. The portion was large, so I took half back to my hotel to eat for lunch the next day. The average dish price is around $20, and tastes just like a dish you'd pay $12-15 for in NYC."
"This is the second time we have been to the restaurant. It is hard to find good Pork Noodle soup. It is very good here, the pork is tasty and not fatty. The helping does not look like a lot but it is very filling. I compare it to Vancouver which is known for good Noodle restaurants and we love it. My husband always has the spicy oriental noodles with chicken. He loves it and always is over full because he says he cannot stop eating it. Once again the prices are higher then home but it seems all places to eat in the hotels are a bit more pricy."
"Can't fault the food or the service. Excellent and authentic.

The one negative was that we queued for 30 minutes, having been told there were no reservations or priority line - it was purely a first-come first-served walk-in. When we were front of line and a table became free, another family walked in right past us with a Bellagio 'host' (I assume that means a guest relations person) and took the table that had just been prepared for us. The restaurant manager was apologetic but it left us with an extremely bad feeling.

I understand the hotel has to cater for its bigger spenders but it shouldn't do so at the expense of slapping regular customers in the face."
Cant go wrong with noodles in any fashion you desire. From hot and spicy and robust flavors to the mild savory dishes . Great service.
Good food - nice servers.  Average wait time.  Had late night dinner of pork fried rice and crispy fried noodle w/shrimp.  Both excellent.
"So many wonderful choices, and they have kimchee that that tastes just like my mom's! You can't go wrong with any choice."
"Great food . We did have to wait in line for 30 mins ,but it was so worth it.
Check out the tooth picks best I have come across"
"This restaurant is in the heart of the Bellagio casino, always seems to busy but the food and the service was excellent, seats are quite 'cosy' close to other tables but otherwise perfect."
"I liked that they serve dim sum for most of the day; good dim sum, the kind one would find in a high quality china town. I also enjoy the variety of noodle bowls they offer, from ramen to undon, the meals are great. The food and service were great, and the price was even competitive. I have no real complaints about this restaurant."
"We were staying at Bellagio and wanted a late night snack. We were very pleasantly surprised. Noodles has a diverse Asian menu at reasonable prices. We thoroughly enjoyed the Pad Thai which was served with wide noodles, which was a change from the ordinary. Can't wait to go back!"
"We had dim sum in a crowded restaurant, but service was great.  The food is really tasty. Shrimp balls, dumplings, chive dumpling, spring rolls.  We kept eating and eating."
"We waited in line for this restaurant for a very long time. When we were finally seated, we waited another 45 minutes for our food. The food was only average and absolutely not worth the wait! The customer service was great though. They just need to find a better process so people don't have to wait so long."
We always dine here during our stay at Bellagio. Never disappoints. Lots of food for the money. Great service.
"We needed a place to eat after checking in at midnight, and boy was Noodles delicious.  It was one of the best chinese restaurants I have ever visited.  Delicious meal with great service."
Yummy Thai tom-Yum soup and chicken sweet & spicy noodles were a hit for our group.  Hits the spot late at night!!
"I went there with my three kids and wife whilst visiting the Bellagio hotel. We wanted something a bit different and we all enjoy Asian food a lot, so this was the perfect choice!"
Some of the best Asian food we have ever had!  We wound up eating here twice during out stay and both meals were truly wonderful.
"Without previous reservations at dinner time we searched Bellagio for a place to eat and every restaurant had a long wait except Noodles.  Since we were starving and it was late we ate here.  Our meal was fine.  No complaints, but it didn't seem any different from any other chinese restaurant."
This location inside of Bellagio is fantastic.  There is also one within Caesars Palace where you can see the pasta being hand-made and tossed.  Great restaurant if you enjoy Chinese food.
Ate lunch here during our stay. Food was good. Of course meals are going to be expensive on the strip. We opted to find other eating establishments not in casinos.
"If you are Asian then you'll know that after a few days you get a craving for a bowl of rice or noodles.   We had been travelling for nearly three weeks and when we stayed in the Bellagio, Noodles was the first place we went to for dinner to get my Chinese fix.  Hubby had wonton noodles, daughter had chicken congee (savoury soupy rice) and I had Hainan chicken rice.  It was all delicious!  We shared a plate of pea sprouts and that was perfectly stir-fried with a little garlic.  Expect to pay top dollar compared to Asia and also queue as very popular."
"Had a pre-show dinner here and we enjoyed every morsel.  We are not big on ""authentic"" asian cuisine so maybe I am not the best to critique this type of food, but everything we had was tasty!  I must say that the menu reflects authentic asian cuisine so if you are looking for for that, this is the place!  Yummy and large portions!"
Another visit to noodle bellagio - chai men noodle with chicken- nice staff very quick to be seated and to be served. Very yummy and good plates - big portion. To be tasted very good Asian restaurant!
"After over-paying at another restaurant in the Bellagio, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality, service and prices at Noodles. All three of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals."
"We found this place when visiting Vegas in 2012. We absolutely loved it. We finally went back in February and it was no where near as good as we remembered it. Food was bland and oily, we felt kind of rushed by the staff."
"Ended up here after looking for somewhere more casual to eat whilst staying at the Bellagio. 

Overall the food was great for the price (especially in the Bellagio), the line up was a bit daunting when we arrived but the staff were more than accommodating and realising that we were only a couple they were able to seat us at the bar rather quickly. 

We ordered two dishes to share and serve of rice. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and arrived within a good time frame and the service staff were attentive."
"This is one of the best combination Asian restaurants in my experience.  I would be happy with any dish on the menu, but unfortunately limit myself to 1 or 2 each visit.  A pleasure to dine here."
"We had the set meal, 3 courses for $35 each. 

Eating in the Bellagio is expensive and found this place to be very reasonable in comparison.

About a 15 min wait to be seated. food arrived hot fresh and generous portions. 

All the dishes tasted very nice, and service was very quick.

Would eat there again if I was stopping in the Bellagio."
"Really enjoyed our dinner here. They serve great Asian comfort food in a modern, appealing setting. I loved the sweet and spicy noodles!"
"We had an early dinner at Noodles.  We each ordered a different noodle dish and we all loved our meals.  We were seated quickly and the service was excellent.  We were able to get in and out pretty quickly, which was what we wanted that evening.  Prices were very reasonable and the portions were generous.  I will definitely eat at Noodles again."
"I went here with my mom in the afternoon. We each had hot tea and she had potstickers, I had sweet and sour chicken. The food was really fresh and had great flavor. The portions were huge, we had plenty of chicken for both of us even though we each ordered our own meal. The chicken was really nice white meat chicken breaded nicely. It had a bit of a cinnamon flavor to it, the sauce. Mom said she enjoyed her food as well. Service was great and I was shocked how quick the food came out. We considered coming back her later in the week again for a late night snack but ended up deciding on something sweet. If given the chance in the future I will go back to Noodles for sure!"
"Just arriving to Vegas after a delayed trip from México, our lunch in Noodles was a very satisfying experience. Great food, nice atmosphere."
Stays open until about 2am and has authentic Chinese fare. We LOVED our server since she was from Hong Kong and got to chat about our holiday in her city.
"We stayed at Bellagio and ordered food while playing poker, picked it up and brought it back to the room.  They serve the food in a disposable tray with a lid so the food stays warm, which was great.  Also, you can order until 1:45AM, which is nice.  We had the mongolian beef and fried rice.  The beef was very flavorful and not overcooked.  We'd definitely try it again."
"offer dim sum for lunch during weekends.  Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  regular menu if good too, especially set menus such as lunch special."
I love noodles and rice and this is one of my favorites. Every time am in Vegas I come here. Everyone should come to this awesome place. Udon is a must and any rice will do. The price is let's say fair and the service is good. You may want to book or wait for about 20 minutes to get a table
I love you Mr. Noodles! Huge foodie hunter and absolutely love this place. Please be my friend Mr. Noodle! I love you!!!!
We had to do a 30 min line up. Then we waited like 30 min if not more for your lunch. Pad Thai was good. Service and price ok
"Almost always seemed to be a line to get a seat in this small slice of noodle heaven!  Each member of the staff I encountered were very friendly and most accommodating.  I had Wonton Shrimp soup and Shrimp Dumplings.  Both were very good!  

The menu had many selections of noodle dishes but I only had the opportunity to taste one.  If I had the time I would have gone back to try some others.  I think they will deliver meals to your room during their operating hours.  All in all a very nice dining experience...except for the waiting in line. Relatively small dining room just off the casino floor."
"Located right in the middle of the Bellagio this restaurant is not only convenient, but the food is high quality. Ask the server for recommendations and you will not be disappointed."
"Pretty much as the title goes. This is the best Asian food I've had, almost!
The best place I've ever eaten is actually the Thad Thierre in East Dean, East Sussex.

But this place is right behind it for sure!

The noodles, the rice and the sweet and sour pork! So so So so GOOD!

I loves it. If I'm ever back in Vegas. I will make sure I go back. Just delicious!"
"We were lucky enough to be in Vegas during a Friday and Saturday, which are the only days (from 11:00 - 3:00) that Noodles serves Dim Sum. My husband and I had never had the experience of eating this way before, but have wanted to for quite awhile. We were very happy with the experience and had to force ourselves to stop ordering the yummy little bits from the carts that they brought around. We visited twice, during our stay, and my husband did order off the menu on our second visit. That was very delicious, as well. If we return to the Bellagio, this would definitely be a restaraunt that I would return to at any time of the day."
I wanted to grab a quick (yet healthy) bite to eat before my poker tourney and decided to eat here. The service was great (efficient) and the food was very good. It is also very family friendly and provide a great selection of food/drink.
Great chinese food. Excellent noodle dishes and good service. Usually crowded and usually a wait and they don't take reservations
"When we first arrived we needed a quick bite and this was quick and tasty. The Brunch had a really long line, but we ordered take-out dumplings and the staff was very helpful."
"I stayed at the hotel and I was unpacking while watching the house channel. The head chef was talking about the restaurant and constantly used the word ""yummy"". It was adorable and I knew I had to give it a shot. Despite a fairly long wait I really enjoyed it. Truly, it was yummy.

I had the fixed menu and it was pretty reasonably priced. I had some wonderful wine and dessert as well. The mango pudding was prefect!

I was on my own and ate at the back counter. Everyone back there sorta took me on as their ""table"" and every single one of them were friendly and helpful. 

Loved it!"
"You have to wait a lot if you visit here at night. But foods are very delicious, tasty, well cooked and heated. Price is not that expensive considering that this is LV"
name said it all.  place does get crowded because its in one of the busier hotels.  staff is very friendly and the place is very clean.  price is mid to expensive.  don't expect a cheap meal
"We ate here twice -- really liked that you could order small dishes to share.  Order a few small things, then if you are still hungry, order something else.  Steamed pork buns are good.  Really good was the Malaysian Roti with curry sauce - sounds like it would be pretty dull - but it was soooo good."
"Prices and portions were OK, however both entrees we had lacked any flavor.  I had the Chow Mein with BBQ Pork and my wife he the XO Vermicelli with Crab.  Quality seemed more on par with fast food then a restraunt at Belagio."
A great selection of pan-Asian food at good prices (the Haianese hicken was fabulous). Service was fast and the restaurant itself is  nice little escape from the noisy gambling floor!
Good service and delicious food.  We enjoyed the dim sum selections. My favorite drink in the past was the Reaching Nivan-a. So good.
"Very happy to have tried this place. My buddy and I both were extremely satisified with our meals. Service and decor are fine, nothing amazing but for the high quality food of the food it is very reasonably priced. 

Definitely worth having a meal here if you're at Bellagio."
"For a high end hotel this was a poor quality noodle house in my opinion. Portions were small for the price... I really didn't expect a lot but for a 20 dollar noodle dish to have 4 mid size shrimp on it was not much. Won ton soup was extremely fishy with a dirty broth taste. 
 Service was quick and curt , with no kindness about it. Granted my plate was almost empty but I was still eating . To watch my plate disappear off the table before I could say anything was almost comical. 
I listened to several guests say they have eaten here and it's just OK. They said they eat here because its quick. 
I won't eat here again."
Good service and delicious food.  We enjoyed the dim sum selections. My favorite drink in the past was the Reaching Nivan-a. So good.
"Maybe it's only us, but we visited most of Bellagio's eateries, Noodles is our favourite. The waiters are simply great, the selection of food is fantastic, most especially when they walk around with those cars full of freshly made dim sums... The soups are phenomenal and we could not go there often enough to try everything we wanted...."
"Food is just okay. Service was slow, but many people. Beef soup not the best the beef was way overcooked."
"Our first meal after a transatlantic flight, jet lag was kicking in and this was the perfect place to eat. Food is very good and the beer cold, with very pleasant staff what more could you ask for.  
We would definitely eat here again."
"For those who feel like some simple soothing Chinese food instead of those fancy western cuisine on the Strip, the Noodles would not disappoint you. Noodles and congee here are among my favorite. Though I said the food is simple, it does not mean it is not delicately made. The decor of the restaurant includes idyllic elements such as jars to store grains and straws from paddy field with modern design, just like the food, simple and soothing."
The chef and the food are all Hong Kong authentic. A quick place by the casino floor with excellent Chinese food.
Every time I go to Vegas I have to go to the Bellagio to get my Noodle fix.  This place is by far the best place to eat.  The foods is so fresh and tasty and the portions of a decent size.  Welcoming staff.
"Depending on the time you arrive be prepared to queue, as this venue gets very busy especially with visitors from the Far East, if you can avoid around 8pm as we tried to get in at that time and were told it could take up to one hour, so we left and came back another night earlier.

The staff are very attentive without being intrusive, if your drinks are running low they ask if you would like another one.  The menu is comprehensive without going over the top, my wife went for the beef chow mien whilst I went for the chicken chow mien, both dishes had ample portions and the meats were cooked to perfection and very tasty too.

Service was very quick and we had our meal and dessert and were out within the hour, but at no time were we rushed, as I have stated this is very popular with people from the Far East which is a good sign (I do the same with curry houses in this country, if Asians are eating there then you know it is good), so Noodles had a big thumbs up from my wife and I, if you are going to the show at the Cirque then this is an ideal venue for a pre or prior theatre meal."
Very rarely do you get such a lovely setting in a dim sum restaurant.  We love the variety of selections and my only criticism is that sometimes the fried items can be a little greasy.
"In the midst of the casinos, are lots of junky food choices.  Noodles has a great international noodles menu, along with drinks to pair with those fun dishes.  The decor is clean and modern.  the service was helpful and friendly.  Prices were moderate.  Overall, a really nice option at Bellagio"
"Could have been dining in Hong Kong or Melbourne...really, really good food. Subtle and unobtrusive service and well-priced. Great for dining overnight"
We stopped in at Noodles after our flight to Vegas late at night. Great service and good food. My mom raved about the pad thai.
Stopped for quick lunch and enjoyed!!! We had the rice and fried noodles and the flat rice noodles which were very good. We got good service and enjoyed.
"Staying at the Hotel Belaggio made our stay in the first place in Vegas, but exploring this restaurant made it even better! Not once, but four times in seven days...

And if you ask why spend so much time in Vegas in one restaurant, I'd answer it's because the authenticity. Not just because of the design, which is very cosy but in the meantime modern and sharp, but because of the meals. Took the Pad Thai noodles first which was not really my type of saucing, but the next visit I took the rice with crab which was outstanding with my miso soup. 

Staff is very friendly and polite, if you have any questions they happy to help, although the waiting line is always very long, but the waiters don't hurry to sit you down, even though there is free table. That's why the excellent is waiting ahead, the waiting is sometimes way too long to bear.  

Spending the lunch-time there while resting a little bit after shopping - is the best place in the area, but I advice you to make a reservation if you know you will be very hungry, as the place is always crowded and full. I will make one next time!"
"Visited with my wife and two teenagers. Had Chilean Sea Bass, Xo Crabmeat Vermicelli, Cantonese Roast Duck, and rice. No overwhelming flavors. Everything perfect. Service was attentive. Overall, a nice casual place with an upscale, contemporary look. Please do not wear lousy shorts or torn up jeans to this place. Hate it when people fail to look at themselves in the mirror before they go out."
"Never have eaten here and were pleasantly surprised that everything was wonderful, the service was very good and the food was exceptional. We had Shrimp Tempura and a great like house fried rice, followed with a very good rice beer. We will return."

"Went there during our stay at the Bellagio. Worth the price, the only downside was the long lane. It took us 20 minutes, service was nice and friendly, food was very good."
Ate here with no reservations and didn't have to wait. The food was good and what you would expect for LV prices. Big portions.
Nothing to dislike all good....service fantastic....really friendly staff.....food was on the money....place was really busy and still waiting time for food was 5/10 minutes max
Amazing!   I wish this restaurant was near my home. I would eat here everyday. Best Pad Thai I have ever had. The Kung Pao is great as well.
Have been to las vegas 3 times and always go to Noodles. The service is attentive and the food fabulous.
Their food is amazing!! This is as authentic as it gets! Any dish you order is  going to be great! They have dim sum on Fri Sat Sun.
Service could have been better though the food was a generous portion and excellent taste.  Good ambiance in restaurant and open till late.
"Aside from a very prominent language problem,  the Vegetarian Udon was the bomb, as was their Field of Greens salad and their prices!
The decor was bright and original as well!"
Fast friendly service with great food.  BUTTTT very expensive for what it is.  Vegetable dishesand dim sumwere at least 2X what youd pay in a good Asian restaurant.  But its good for lunch or a fast informal dinner.
Great choice at Noodles and they catered for my vegan husband which was fantastic.  We didn't have to wait too long for a table - but depends on the time you go at.  Tasty food and very popular.
"My husband and I went to Noodles during our stay in the Bellagio in Vegas. We had been on a previous visit and found it great food and good value for money. We ordered starters and waited longer than any previous visit. My husband was given his eventually but we were convinced they forgot mine. We mentioned I had ordered the satay chicken and it did then arrive. They then brought out our mains straight away, despite us barely starting our appetisers. This is not what has happened here previously so I genuinely think they were delayed with our starter ( we noticed our waiter had spent over twenty minutes with one table of many diners) so I guess they were late in sending the starter out. It was too soon to have the main but that would be my only complaint.
Despite this the food is always great and the portions generous; neither of us could finish the meal but it was very tasty none the less. My husband had Laksa which was spicy and full of flavour and very authentic. I had the pork chow mien and again it was delicious with generous amounts of pork. All in all very nice, just felt a bit overwhelmed having the mains served with the starter. Had there been a sensible gap between courses I am sure we would have eaten the lot. It won't stop us going back as you can't fault the food, the portions or the value. It's worth giving Noodles a try."
"Diferent from Brazilian food. Loved it! Tip: have the bloody mary. Dinner time, make reservation. Big meals. If you dont eat a lot might share"
"Authentic Northern Chinese food in a very interesting setting. The place seems to be popular with the Chinese and that is always a good sign.

Ordered noodles and congee and both were excellent!"
Didn't thing I would go to Las Vegas and eat at a noodle shop but it was surprisingly good.  Wide  variety of dishes inspired by different types of Asian cooking.  Enjoyed it but service was a little slow.
"There was a huge language barrier between us and the staff. The menu was overpriced, average flavor and slow. I had the Kung Pao Chicken - it was nowhere close to what I'm used to multiple places in multiple states. Hubby had Sesame chicken - same deal. Rice was dry. The staff wasn't very friendly and we would definitely spend our money elsewhere."
"If you are looking for a meal in the Bellagio that won't break the bank, Noodles is a good choice. The place is popular with Asian visitors, a good sign. Ingredients  are of a high quality, and service is friendly. The wait for a table can be long during peak hours.though."
"Looking for a decent Cantonese food on the Strip and found it here.
20 min wait on Sunday evening however food came quickly once ordered.

A fish dish, chinese vegetables, fried rice, and roast pork filled the spot.

Service was ok and prices were reasonable for the Strip."
"We love this place!
The sweet and spicy cucumbers are a favorite and the pad Thai is wonderful.  They tend to cater faster to their ""own"" but service is good and fast.  Expect to wait for a table.  Dim sum at lunch looks good but we usually order off the menu."
"While going to an art show at the Bellagio a friend and I stopped by to have lunch. Several tables were open, however we were seated by the door to the kitchen. The food was good, the service was OK...nothing extraordinary about this restaurant except the prices. You can get a much better meal, much better service and a more friendly atmosphere a few blocks up the street at the Red 8 inside the Wynn for the same price. It's worth the monorail ride!  Convenience is it's only feature...I think coffee and a pastry would be s better option to hold you over until you can get to a place that will appreciate your business."
I usually arrive later in the evening from the airport so after I'm checked in I head straight for Noodles to have a bowl of their delicious soups.  I start looking forward to it on the drive from the airport!
"We visited here 2 years ago and it was just as good on our return.  We ate here the night we arrived and wanted something relatively quick and easy.

When we arrived for dinner there was a bit of a queue, but it soon went.

The food is very fresh and tasty.  They were more than happy to adapt dishes and make them vegetarian.

My partner rated the Calamari."
"After visiting the Bellagio fountains one evening and walking through the conservatory, we decided to stop and have dinner at Noodles. It’s a small place, and there was somewhat of a line. We ended up waiting about 35 minutes before being seated. The service was impeccable. The menu is very interesting and extensive. We ordered Curry Chicken Rice and Combination Barbeque Rice, and we were extremely impressed with our meals. Our waiter did a great job of explaining without being asked that our dishes would not be the typical fried rice dish that you might get in an Asian restaurant. 
We would highly recommend this spot and we plan to go back the next time we visit Vegas."
"We came to Vegas with our family of 4 (kids are 10 and 12) over spring break, staying at the Four Seasons Hotel. A special part of our trip was tickets to O at the Bellagio. We decided to see the fountains a couple hours before the show, then find a family friendly restaurant to eat at. Much easier said than done! We wandered around the Bellagio and found very nice restaurants but none which looked welcoming to children. Noodles was the exception! We made the mistake of each ordering our own dish  and thus had much too much food, but it was delicious! My daughter and I had Pad Thai Shrimp which was amazing! This is not an inexpensive restaurant, but it is a very good choice for families: a relaxed comfortable atmosphere, very nice service, delicious food,  just steps from the theatre within the Bellagio. Can't go wrong here if you love noodles!"
Stay out late and then had a quick bite of chinese food.  Good selection of meatless dishes and chinese food.  Wait staff was very quick and accommodating.
"This was the first time I had ever been in Noodles.  My wife and I went while on vacation in Las Vegas.

We arrived and were promptly seated.  We weren't there looking for a heavy meal, so the Dim Sum carts made for a great lite lunch.  We ordered some of the Sesame Balls, dumplings, etc.  Everything we tried was really, really tasty.  The carts kept coming around, so there was always something different to try.

For Dim Sum, I would definitely go back."
We always have a great meal here at Noodles at Caesars Palace.   I get the combo chop suey and my husband usually gets the hot garlic fish.  Both are very good.  We had some dumplings to begin our meal - shrimp and pork and they were delicious.    I always come back when we stay at Caesars.  Good Asian without wandering far.
"Being from Vancouver where Dim Sum is an event and is always of great quality, this place simply doesn't add up.  The Har Gau and Shiu Mai dumplings were small hard and basically overcooked and tasteless.  I also ordered a plate of fried noodles (Chow Mein), with chicken.  It was overly greasy and lacked much character of flavour.  Another annoying part was from the moment I sat down, the staff were rushing me, taking the menu away, asking if I wanted the bill to my room, and once I ordered, they were quick to want to clear me out of there.  I was sitting at the counter, not a table...this service as pretty bizarre.  I would not recommend going here, instead take a cab to the Noodle Shop at the Palazzo Hotel, it does a much better job.  Finally it was overly expensive for such poor quality - $60 for one person simply isn't worth it."
"New visit to this restaurant.
Very nice staff very quick
Great portion on rice or noodle
Very good and fresh dim sum brought by a staff with a small truck at lunch time 
Large choice of plates and yummy!
To be tasted! Attractive prices"
"Friend tried to call for reservation but they just told us to come down, only had to wait 15 minutes but the book said they take reservations.  food was great, service was good, a bit pricey but very good"
"This place does take out if you are staying in Bellagio Yeah!!!
We had the steamed shrimp and pork dumplings, soup and mandarin beef stew all were excellent."
"While staying at the Bellagio my husband and myself decided we would like to try most of the onsite restaurants.  We stopped here after an hour or so of people watching and slots!  We were seated pretty quick and our server was great.  Typical Asian favorites, all done very well. The food was very good overall and came out in a reasonable time.  Would def recommend."
"We went for dinner before the Cirque show attempting to simplify the night by eating in the same hotel as the show. The food was decent, which was the high point of the experience. It took an inordinately long time to place our order, receive our food and finally get the check. The staff seemed unaware that there were patron seated that may like some attention, like a refill on their water. 

Had I only checked TripAdvisor before going in, we could have gone for a better experience."
"My friend and I visited ""Noodles"" after touring the Conservatory. We ordered the vegetable appetizer and chicken refried rice. Our waitress was excellent.  The décor was very attractive. We enjoyed a nice leisurely lunch, felt very comfortable and  never felt hurried. Very nice experience."
"Noodles (I  mean literally) were great, as was the rice dish. Genuine oriental food. Informal atmosphere, tables a bit close to each other, and a bit noisy, but good for a pre dinner meal. Avoid spare ribs unless you like fatty boiled meat, nothing like what we know at home. Main courses were by far the best part."
"We came here a bit late, maybe 9pm by the time we got to dinner, and the place was full.  There wasn't a line yet though- the hostess told us they were just waiting for a table that had paid to leave and then they'd clean a table for us.  It took maybe 5 minutes to be seated.  I noticed later in the meal there was a decent size line.  In any case, we were seated and the service was very good and efficient.  We did a fixed menu price for $28 each and got miso soup, spring rolls, and a noodle dish.  I also ordered thai iced tea that was awesome and my daughter got a mango pudding dessert she liked.  No complaints- good food and service for a reasonable price."
"One of the best Asian restaurants in Vegas. We ended eating here 3 times our last trip. The line to get in can be long during peak hours, but definitely worth it. Like most places in Vegas, a little pricey, but food was delicious. Highly recommended"
Portions are on larger side so don't order too much :-)  Noodles are always good choice here.  It could get busy at time so come before or after dinner time if you don't want to wait long for a table.
Had lunch here and was surprisingly pleased with the quality of the food and the attention of the staff.  Would definitely recommend
"We ended up here twice while on our trip but that's not because it was so good that we couldn't stay away. It's because they were one of the only restaurants open really late. 

On our first trip in was shaky. The line was out the door so there was a wait, which is fine, but once we got seated the service wasn't very good from the beginning. The staff seemed rude and we got the impression that we were inconveniencing them. We chalked it up to a long day and a busy night until they totally forgot to make my wife's order. They brought her soup but after several attempts to get her meal we gave up. I ended up sharing my chicken pad thai with her, which I will say was quite tasty. The soup and pot stickers on the other hand were average at best.

We are all about second chances and know that everyone is entitled to an ""off"" night so we decided to give it another try a couple of nights later. On our second trip in we got everything that we had ordered and had a much better experience. The food came out quickly but it still wasn't as good as you'd expect for the price. I got the Wing Zing (wings) and decided to give the pot stickers another try. The wings were pretty good but even though this time around they were pretty large, the pot stickers were still average. My wife got the BBQ pork chow mein. I didn't try it but she said it was pretty good. 

All said, they redeemed themselves (somewhat) and the food was good enough."
"We had just arrived and unpacked, noon and hungry. Lunch time, busy, seated us promptly. The restaurant was clean, nice atmosphere. We ordered to share a couple plates. Ordered the dry side ribs and stir fried vegs, rice bowl. We were still very, very hungry when we left. For the two of us it came to $50 some odd dollars. Way too much for the small amount we received. Service was friendly and someone was always coming by to ask if we needed more coffee, etc. Tasted good. Looked around and we saw other dish's bigger quantity, guess we ordered the wrong items for being hungry!!!"
"We didn't have a booking but the wait was only 20 minutes and it was well worth it. Lovely, clean eating with a great variety of food. Service was very friendly but a little slow due to the limited wait staff that was available. I would allow some time to enjoy the ambiance and the company of your loved ones as you dine."
"I dined here whilst staying at the Bellagio and wasn't disappointed.
This time I dined for one and they were more than happy set me at a table although I had no issues sitting at the bar area.
I was there for afternoon dim sum followed by a lovely crab fried rice.
The dim sum was very good and as I have already stated my crab fried rice was lovely, I would recommend a visit if your at the Bellagio a very smart restaurant but it's inside the Bellagio and everyrthing is smart haha, lots of choice inside the hotel but worth a shout.
The End"
"We have dined at Noodles several times over the last few years and have decided that this will be our last time.  The first time we tried them, we both enjoyed the meal and even the second time the meal was decent though expensive.  The third time we were not impressed, less impressed the fourth time and totally dissatisfied this last time.  The soup had no taste and was very difficult to eat.  Our appetizers were not worth the price we paid and the rest of the meal we only picked at before deciding we just didn't want to eat something we didn't enjoy.  The service was very slow, took forever to get waited on and then ignored until bill arrived.  Don't know what happened to the place but it definitely has changed and not for the good."
"The food was served barely warm.  We had to ask several times for  soy sauce.  There was a ""whale"" at another table, it was fun watching the staff be at his beckon call.  His food came out steamy and hot."
"We stayed at the Bellagio 9 days and we loved going to Noodles for brunch. Anytime we are starving or have to eat quick, we go to Noodles! On weekends they have dimsum in carts so the moment you sit they come to you and you can have your fill while the kitchen preps whatever else you order from the menu, although dimsum alone is good enough for lunch. We never had any issues with their service or food -- it was always good. Best part of it all is the price! It's hard to find reasonable pricing in the Bellagio or anywhere in the Strip and I thought Noodles' pricing was just right."
"On a whim one evening after a long days sightseeing we decided to indulge our craving for fried rice by going to Noodles restaurant in the Bellagio hotel. The wait time to enter the restaurant was long, we stood for about half an hour. This service could potentially be improved by perhaps issuing a numbered ticket to allow guests to perhaps grab a drink and sit down while waiting. The service was adequate but not excellent. We waited a long time for our order to be taken and when it arrived my order did not appear until about ten minutes after my sisters did, I had to ask and remind them of my mine. The food itself was delicious, potentially the best Chinese food I have tasted in fact. The portion size was huge so I took the remainder of my meal I could not finish back to our hotel room to eat later when I was more hungry. 
A small complaint would be that the general cleanliness around the bar area could be improved. We were sat at the end of the bar next to the entrance to the kitchen and the floor was soiled with trodden waste food. Not very appealing. 

A good place to stop for a quick and tasty meal."
"My bad- I ordered the spicy thai shrimp soup. It was so hot, my nose was dripping and my throat was burning! 
In a big table: my friends orded the beef brisket soup which was AMAZING! Meat was so tender. 
The fried rice looked good but the Pad Thai looked like it had way too much sauce. 
Word to the wise- us 7 girls each ordered an entree and this place is really meant for family style sharing. Don't over order and watch the spice level."
"Was in Vegas for a conference and had dinner here one night. I had the beef fried rice, and it was incredible. Probably one of the best I've ever had. The waiter was also super nice. They gave me the incorrect order the first time, but fixed it in under 5 minutes. No doubt I'll be going back."
"Even if you don't like ""Chinese"" food this is worth your visit.  The servers are excellent and helpful with us white folks who know nothing about ordering.  And they are a lot of fun, with great personalities.  The food we had was excellent.  The beef noodle soup was the best and the dim sum was awesome.  We had a chicken dish with broccoli that was okay, but not as good as the other items.  I guess we should have stuck with their signature dishes witch the dim sum and beef noodle were.  Plenty of food and the prices are great.  It is at the Bellagio and I would have expected a lot more in cost,  If we get back to Vegas we will return.  A fun place to eat.  Tip, go early.  They don't take reservations and regulars know that they have to wait in line during peak hours, but they aren't reluctant to wait because it is that good."
I was in Vegas for a conference.  I went here for dinner.  I loved every part of it. The drink was great.  The food was great.  I ordered the plum duck and rice.  It was fantastic.  I have been to Vegas a lot of times and this one is a find. I will be going back.
"The wife and I always stop at Noodles in the Bellagio and have a nice time. 

The service is top notch and the doshes are very good. They have a nice selection of drinks also. 

Prices aren't that bad for the amount of food you get. They leave you very full and not much room left for dessert."
This is only a small restaurant which could do with being bigger given the number of people that want to come here. It doesn't take reservations and there always seems to be a queue. not surprising as the food and service were both very good and at very reasonable prices.
At at this restaurant during the Chinese New Year. The service was a little slow but the restaurant was packed! The food was really good. We had a seafood noodle dish and chicken skewers. Despite how busy the restaurant was the servers took the time to talk to us and we felt part of the New Year excitement. If you are an M-Life member and qualify for the line passes it might be worth getting a pass for this restaurant. It cut our wait down by at least half.
"Did not like that they do not take reservations, had to wait 15 minutes. Very good food at very reasonable prices in the B."
Great food! The noodles are fun to watch being made and delicious to eat.  The shrimp appetizer was like nothing I've had before. So good! A must try if you get the chance.
"One of the few casual dining in Bellagio, no reservations. It is small so try not to go at peak hours.  Had the sea bass, chow mein and dumplings.  All were good but PF Changs is better for the price.  Good variety though, very large menu with dim sum items.  My cousin had one of the soups and kept adding chili to it. She said it was good but a little bland compared to what she is used to in Singapore. 

We stayed at the Bellagio so good enough to go back twice during our stay but more for convenience than extraordinary food.  

Service was good. Overall no complaints just no wow factor for me."
"Hands down best food I've ever had in Vegas!

The staff are friendly and attentive! You will not go hungry, portion sizes are large!

The food was so good, we got take out for our plane ride home!"
"Try the Pad Thai!
So delicious we went back the next day to order take out for our flight home!
Service was excellent. Friendly staff."
"I have tried many noodle places, some are interesting but none seem to be so constantly safe and pleasing. A (relatively) quiet haven inside the Bellagio, late opening hours and so many asian customers. The right address even for something as simple as a chicken noodle soup."
"After a long drive from Tucson and after check-in we asked about a nice casual restaurant  for lunch. 
Noodles was recommend, What a very good idea.
Mark had Duck and it was soon of the best he had ever had."
Had dinner here while staying at Bellagio.  I ordered a fried noodle dish with chicken and vegetables and husband ordered Seafood noodle soup.  Both were excellent.  Lots of seafood in the soup and my dish had a ton of chicken and was very fresh tasting.  Ricky was our server and he was friendly and fast.. loved Noodles - wish we had one here in Detroit!
This restaurant is located in the Bellagio Resort.  The food is delicious and the service very attentive.  I recommend both the  noodle soup and the miso soup.
"This morning, I woke up a little late and went downstairs from the Bellagio to have breakfast at this place called Noodles. I was served by these apparently busy looking staff members. I ordered their wonton noodles which is their signature dish. This dish is common amongst Asian countries. My opinion of it was only ""meh"". Bear in mind, I am an Asian who grew up eating this dish. I was somewhat left expecting something more from it.

Food aside, after finishing my meal, I was given a hint by one of the waiter to leave (not so subtlely). He came and asked if I was done almost straight after I finished and took my plate away, followed by the question ""is that all sir?"" The bill landed in front of me within a minute of this event. As you can imagine, dining solo, it made me extremely uncomfortable.

Considering this restaurant sits in the same building as 2 AAA five star restaurants, the serving standards can be better. If this restaurant was not the new kid on the block, I would have immediately failed it on service alone. Since the food was ""acceptable"", based on that alone, I would give it a passing grade. Hope this review will help you fix your staffs' issues. Perhaps a cross cultural training is overdue."
"If you are looking for a fast, tasty and authentic Asian meal at the Bellagio, Noodles is a great option. We went there for lunch and were pleasantly surprised at how fast our food came. We ordered the Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles with barbecue pork and the Japanese Seafood Udon soup. Both were excellent. The BBQ pork was tender and flavorful and the Udon soup was unique--with large pieces of squid, pink fish, shrimp and, of course, the Udon noodles. They offered Dim Sum cart service as well but we were in a bit of a rush. Would definitely return for dinner!"
"The food was over the top.  I think the setting should have been
more formal for the quality of food.  Great service and even better
food."
"My wife and I had dinner here over the weekend and were both really dissapointed at the entire experience. The key ingrediant, the food taste, was subpar. Both the chicken and meat in each of our dishes tasted like microwaved meat reheated. The fried rice was bland. Appetizers less than appetizing. The service was the same as the food...poor. Finally we got up to pay at the front since our waiter could not be found anywhere. We espected FAR more for a place located in the Bellagio. Perhaps we caught them on an off night?"
"Amazing restaurant food was amazing and didn't want to stop ordering as there was so much choice , service great. Great atmosphere. A must visit"
Got up early to grab some breakfast but wasn't feeling like the buffet. I noticed the Noodle house was open and said what the heck. So glad I did. The dim sum was awesome . Fresh and tasty. I'd do breakfast here at Noodles in the Bellagio a regular thing :)
"We eat at Noodles every time we visit the Bellagio. The food is great, service is quicked (albeit a little rushed at times) and the prices are reasonable (for a restaurant inside a Strip hotel). We will frequently get take-out from here when we are staying anywhere with an in-room kitchenette or microwave."
"YUM! This place is awesome. Great service, really good food. Wonderful options for Dim Sum and a great menu. It was also fast. It fills up so watch the line but worth the short wait."
"Nice location. Servers seemed rushed and may have had limited English speaking skills. Our food was fine; however, not exactly as we thought it would be. My food was very spicy and the other dish with more noodles than meat."
"Great dum sum menu, good service, excellent beer/sake selection. Here's a hint though, if you think a dish looks like meat strips in a sauce - it might be chicken feet. Wouldnt hurt to ask first..."
"Ten years ago I have experienced delicious Chinese food from this restaurant. Last November I was delighted to discover that the restaurant is still serving the same quality, mouthwatering, authentic Chinese food I had several years back! Though the restaurant is a little pricey, consider the place it is located in, and the quality of food it serves. Between the restaurant serving similar dishes located at the next hotel, Noodles beats the competition hands down. For a satisfying, real Chinese food in a beautiful resort setting, don't miss going to this restaurant. You'll save yourself hundreds of steps, frustration, and money. Like any noteworthy Chinese restaurants, expect it to be noisy and the service rushed, but the food surely makes everything well worth the little annoyances."
"Nice restaurant with a very ample menu on chinese food, we had dinner and opted for a few options at tsble center to share. Good seasoning, they also offer asian beers and sake. Located inside bellagio."
"Full disclosure -- I'm not a connoisseur of Asian cuisine, so I have no idea if Noodles offers an ""authentic"" menu or cooks dishes in a traditional way. 

But what you see is what you get. Good place to grab some noodles or soup and enjoy a little dim sum. Very good option for a quick bite that will fill you up.

The booths themselves are aesthetically interesting. But they're uncomfortable. Grab a table/chairs and enjoy the meal."
The atmosphere is calming. The food is tasty and fresh. The service is attentive and friendly. My only problem was the table next to us had a man that kept coughing. He was a tad annoying.
"Food was OK. Ambience and service were good. Dining alone can be a challenge as sometimes service is not the best as the expected tip is less. Not the case here, staff very attentive and friendly. Food was not as flavorful as I would have liked. Hot and spicey soup was good but not as hot (temperature wise) as I would have liked when delivered to the table.  Overall a little expensive for the quality. Other Asian venues available but I did not have a chance to try them. Maybe next time."
"Very surprised that this tucked away restaurant had delicious Chinese food and speedy service, we ended up eating here twice on a three night stay."
"Hard to get people to pick up a phone, long wait, servers are unhappy you are making them busy, food was as good as any. Expected far better from a 5 star resort."
"Had lunch here after checking into the hotel. My chow mein was great, larger portion size than I was expecting. My won ton soup however had exactly 4 won tons in it and the broth was barely above luke warm. No chance in flagging down our waiter to have it switched out. We could barely get her attention to get our check at the end of the meal. Tasty and cheap, but nothing special."
"Great food at a reasonable price
Tended to get snacks from here while suffering from the England hours jet lag
Late breakfast sandwiches and coffee filled the spot"
"Nice for casual late lunch or early dinner.  The food is very tasty
and very large portions!!  Enjoyed it to sit and chat with colleagues."
"We had a family dinner here, so we appreciated having a good selection of dishes to please everyone in our group. We arrived around 5 pm and still had to wait in line, so it is a popular place. 

The service was very attentive and prompt, even though it was busy that night. The abalone congee was very good (though pricey) with a delicate and refined taste. The noodle in broth dish was ok -- the broth and wontons were delicious, but the noodles were not great. The meat and rice dishes were just ok, nothing special. 

Overall, the food was just ok. There are so many other dining choices that we will probably not go back."
"I'm a bit of a noodle snob, and I found this to be only so so.... I have been to a lot of traditional Pho houses around the US, none of them are upscale so that may be the problem.  The broth didn't seem to taste as good or as slow cooked as most of the places that I've been to, and overall for the money and location it didn't make my favorite list.  It did, however, make my quick list as they got us in quickly for lunch!"
"We particularly liked the duck dishes. The service was prompt, the servers helpful and accommodating."
"This is a great place for a fairly quick lunch or dinner the food is authentic, fresh and priced fairly. Service was good."
"“Noodles” came highly recommended by family so I had to make a stop.

We visited on a weekend so dim sum is served from 11a-3p.  Since we arrived shortly after opening, we were seated quickly (when we left there was a long line).  Tucked in a hidden corner next to the Baccarat area in Bellagio, Noodles is worth a visit (though hotel signage there was slightly confusing). 

I had the black bean noodle stir-fry with beef (“Hor Fun”).  Flavor wise- it was excellent.  My only critique was that some of the noodles were clumped together and it didn't have the traditional mix of vegetables you would normally find in this dish.   My fault for not reading the menu closely.  If you are used to eating traditional “Hor Fun” you should really be ordering the “Pad Thai” there instead.  

During my visit, the restaurant was filled with Chinese (myself included).  We received prompt service majority of the time but I felt we were not treated as attentively and warmly as our neighbors from mainland China were. 

My fiance spotted a “Pineapple Bun” on the dim sum cart, proceeded to point to it to seek confirmation from which the server said “yes.”  To our surprise, there was char siu in the middle instead of the usual custard.   Still very tasty (sweet bun outside paired with savory pork inside)-- just not what we were craving or imagining.   Though I guess it wasn't really their fault since they were not fluent in English as I was speaking in Cantonese with them initially.

For the most part, food was pretty authentic. It wasn't the best Chinese meal I've had in my life but it was satisfying in its own way.  The noodles and rice plates are quite large and are a good value for Las Vegas.  Dim Sum selections are limited (27 menu choices total, including 5 mysterious “chef choices”) and ranged from $3.75-$7.25 a plate.   4 Dim Sum choices + 2 regular plates + tea service came out to about $70 before tips.   Their shrimp dishes were especially wonderful (our family actually raved about their “Won Ton” and “Sea Bass”).  Overall a tasty meal but there's room for improvement service-wise."
This was a great stop to eat at the Bellegio before the O show! We had good service and the atmosphere was very nice!
"I think one of my biggest issues with restaurants at The Bellagio is that I expect more then I typically get - so I'm somewhat setup for disappointment.

Noodles has great promise at first look: Attractive decor, ""authentic"" servers, and a menu that includes authentic items (like the totally gross ""Century Egg"") - that all indicate that it's going to be an outstanding experience. Unfortunately, it's all just a show.

I dined at Noodles with a colleague as we wanted something different, and didn't want to go off property, or wait in a huge line. The restaurant was suggested by the concierge (yeah, they're not jaded, are they?). Anyway, the place is fine - but it's just nothing to write home about. I come from NY, and we have hole-in-the-wall takeout places everywhere here - and we have some good ones, and some bad ones. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate this place a solid 6. You're probably not gonna get anything gross in your food, you're just not gonna get anything that makes you want to go back for more.

Again, it's all about expectations - if you just wanna chow down some chow mein, fine - go and have at it. If you want a great dining experience, and food better then you're used to getting - go elsewhere."
"We split a noodle entree and tempura app, and it was enough for two people.  Wish i'd had room for the mango sticky rice, but it wasn't cheap.
Nice decor."
"We visited Noodles and had to wait for a long time at the door if the restaurant. We were not acknowledged and staff avoided eye contact. We could see free tables so thought that seemed a little poor. A 'hello' or 'be right there' would have been nice. Another customer mouthed to us 'don't do it' to discourage us from going there. The good wasn't great - it was very greasy. Both courses and incredibly over priced for the quality of good and service. The Bellagio is a fantastic hotel and unfortunately I feel Noodles, let's it down."
"Our first night at Paris Las Vegas, the in-hotel noodle place was an easy meal to enjoy before hitting the sack!   Very busy though, so service was patchy."
"We arrived at Noodles late but there were still plenty of customers in the restaurant and many more came in after we had arrived it was late so we didn't have a huge appetite, i made the mistake of ordering a dish i am familiar with, Chow Mein, it was by far the best i have ever eaten tasty and filling and fresh. The decor is also super cool, i have no idea how anyone can make dried noodles in jars look so awesome."
"My husband and I were in the mood for something light for a late dinner.  This was just what we needed.  We ordered one sweet and spicy chicken dish and one vegetable stir fried rice.  We had plenty of delicious food to share ( plus leftovers).  One caveat, if you ask for a soda refill, you will be paying for an extra drink.  We paid close to $50 for our light dinner for two people, soft drinks, tax and tips included."
We should have booked a table so we did not have to wait 45 minutes. But it was worth the wait. The food was very delicious. We shared a starter of calamari in batter that was deep fried. Our main courses were stir fried noodle dishes. The prawns were delicious. I counted five - a pity that there were not a few more. Excluding drinks the meal cost USD55.
"I was in a hurry for my Cirque de Soleil show, Noodles took my order and served fast my food. The food was tasty. The brewed coffee was excellent. The ambience with noodle decoration is good."
"A super meal enjoyed here but you must book beforehand as it is so popular but well worth it.The food was to die for & all the staff were so friendly & took the time to speak with you. It was a bit on the expensive side but as a special treat,it has to be done."
"My daughter and I had dinner here late one night after an exhausting day of travel. The service was wonderful, the beer was really cold and the food was excellent with huge servings. I'd recommend."
and really not worth the amount they charge..the food was okay at best nothing to write home about...over priced!
"This place can have long line ups.  It's not fancy, but if you're in the mood for a good soup while in Las Vegas, this place is worth trying.

I have had some of the other menu items and I haven't been overly impressed.  There is better Asian food in Las Vegas, but the soup is good."
"The four of us enjoy Asian cooking. The host seemed genuinely happy we ordered a big pot of tea to start. He convinced us to try their green tea (we usually drink Jasmine or Oulong). An older gentleman brought the pot of tea. He introduced himself as the owner. He described the great lengths he went to to source the finest tea from China and import it for his restaurant. When he discovered we were from Canada, he sat sown with us and told us his amazing story of coming to America. He was a gracious host the whole evening, even after he left to look after other diners. The food was very good -fresh and flavourful. I would go back there the next time I am in Las Vegas."
"I can only review the dumplings and the soups but they were both very good. I had the shrimp wonton noodle soup which was delicious. The shrimp wontons were so good. The dumplings were good, I ordered them steamed, they were a little overcooked but they had great flavor. The hostess is not the most charming but our waiter was very good. We waited on line about 15 minutes but once seated, we were served very quickly. My husband has Japanese udon soup which he loved. All in all we had a very good experience here."
"Just bad food.  Duck seemed ok, but just on a plate with peanuts - nothing else.  My stomach started complaining about 4 hours later - not good.  Noodle dish was bland, with rubbery, tasteless meat.  Avoid."
"I am basing this review solely on my disappointment on what I consider to be a fairly common Thai noodle dish - Pad Thai. Noodles attempt at pad thai left much to be desired. I also got the Tempura Vegetables, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but would have liked a little more dipping sauce for the vegetables.

The atmosphere at the restaurant was nice. It's casual dining, so need to worry about what you're wearing. It's open till 2am, which is great if you're coming in on a late flight. Also, the portion sizes are large for things like rice and noodles, so keep that in mind when you're ordering. It's great for sharing.

To me price wise, it was expensive, but relative to how much things cost in Vegas, it is on par.

I would probably give the restaurant one more shot in the future, but I would definitely order something other than the pad thai. The person next to me seemed to thoroughly enjoy the Signature Fried Rice."
"Tasty menue, they have simple dishes to exotic dishes. Good experience if you want a different dinner experience. A must try."
"Just bad food.  Duck seemed ok, but just on a plate with peanuts - nothing else.  My stomach started complaining about 4 hours later - not good.  Noodle dish was bland, with rubbery, tasteless meat.  Avoid."
"The portions are Huge, so be prepared to eat. Most American restaurants are large portions however compared to Canadian. Busy so the wait can be long later in the evening."
"When I arrived at Bellagio after traveling all day, I could not wait to sit down and have a bowl of noodle soup at Noodles. I had shrimp dumpling wonton soup with udon noodles - YUM!! Good for the heart, good for the soul! They have very flexible hours too so you can enjoy this during the day or late night. I have done both!"
"I like this place for good wonton soup, and noodle soup, but I found the dim sum is not as good as I have eaten in Toronto or San Francisco, Pricey too, in keeping with the location. Some of the ingredients vary from traditional Hong Kong style food.  Very nice service, good place for a quick lunch or late night soup. The whole restaurant is quite small, and you may have a line up to deal with."
We shared 2 courses which were substantial good quality beef in black bean and  chicken noodle. Good service but pricy wine.
"Returning to my favorite restaurant was a huge disappointment this time.  Waited over and hour to be seated while the front desk hostess carried on a loud, noisy dispute on the telephone for over a half hour.  Watched while 5 people, 10 people, 15 people, 20 people exited the restaurant and not one single person diner was allowed  in or seated.  Once we entered the restaurant it was deserted, tables piled high with dishes that hadn't been cleared.  Fortunately, the food is still very good, but the service was so very disappointing."
"We had a good meal here but nothing exceptional. The service is excellent and a real advantage if you are in a hurry.

You need to go a little outside the main meal times or you will have a long line to get in."
Delicious food and the place was very easy to get to. The wait was not bad and the staff was friendly and prompt. Prices are what I expect for Las Vegas dining. Be sure to bring a jacket as it does get cold and if the smoke smell bothers you it does occasionally waft into the restaurant. All in all a good experience!
"reasonable price, we had the set menu and i had a  small warm sake which went down very nicely. Although busy we where seated quickly and served quickly"
A great idea and open nearly 24 hrs a day. Great noodles with lashings of extras. Staff warm friendly and inviting great experience
Best Wonton noodle soup open til late night. Tasty Hongkong noodle also fast service.. We 're very satisfied everytime we visit this place.
"One of the best Asian restaurants I have ever been too.  Even the cart with the appetizers was amazing.  They have a flavor unlike any other I have ever had.  A truly unique fine dining experience.  We stopped here on the way to the airport to go home, and it was hard to leave!"
"Another great restaurant at Noodles at the Ballagio, great dinning and service, helpful and friendly staff, Great value for money, Very busy and had to queue but worth it"
Our food was delicious but they had computer problems two night in a room.  The first night we couldn't eat there.  The second night we couldn't use our gift card because the system was down but they found a workaround.  Reasonable priced for a hotel on the strip.
You do need to pick carefully if you don't like spicy food. The portions were huge - we could have had one between two! Very very tasty though and good value overall
the food is average. I've had better chow mein from the chinese take out. the ambiance is good. the staff was fantastic. in my opinion not worth the price.
we went two nights and they remembered where we sat and asked if we wanted to same table.  Jasmine tea was delicious-
"After travelling for 6 hrs to get to Vegas, Noodles is an excellent place to gather your strength and prep for a long night out. The fixed price menu with soup, dumplings/rolls and choice of noodle dishes is great and good value. The pork bbq meat option works best on the chow mein and the chicken for the pad thai"
"We were very disappointed with our experience of this restaurant. My husband ordered fried noodles that were soggy when they arrived and full of starch, with not enough prawns or general toppings. I had laksa which was better, but again, there was surplus noodles. 
 Very disappointing, and incredibly expensive for quite basic dishes."
5 of us had lunch and tried 5 different dishes and all stunning! spicey chow mein was excellent as was my shrimp chow mein but only complaint would be not enough shrimp 4/5 shrimp in my dish but very tasty meal
"The food was great with very large portions.  We found the service to be excellent and frankly, our waitress was just down right funny.  We all enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  Nice place."
"The atmosphere is lively. You can have an option to eat a noodle soup, of course, but you can also find more plain Asian food or only some snacks. Good thing is that it is open until 2am so you can go after a night club."
"It seems like a common problem among Bellagio restaurants (except Prime) that we've noticed during our week here. Every place had great staff and nice ambiance, but the food is average at best and terrible in some places. Noodles is just bad.

We started with crispy calamari, which was actually good. The sweet chili dipping sauce was very basic and likely made offsite, but this appetizer was edible. My wife had the sweet and spicy noodles, which looked like a plate of leftover spaghetti that was microwaved. It tasted as disgusting as it looked. I had the Kung Pao Beef, and it was terribly disappointing. The flavors were bland and tasted like it was made with canned ingredients.

This place is not worthy of being inside the Bellagio!"
"Tasty food, large variety of Asian dishes served efficiently in this bustling restaurant.  Go early--lines form after 6, and try the Dim Sum which are served on the weekends.  The soups are soothing and a good choice if you have indulged in too much Las Vegas.  Portions are generous, and the food is served without frills.  I ate there twice while at the Bellagio and found the lunch and dinner offerings quite tasty.  The menu is very varied and has interesting varieties of noodles and other dishes.  I enjoyed the eggplant and sauteed tofu dish a lot.  No white tablecloths or fancy settings; good food, well-served, good for all ages."
"The only restaurant I have seen in a Casino consistently with a waiting line is Noodles.  (Buffets do not count)  This restaurant puts out consistent quality of tasty Asian fusion food in large portions.   If you do not leave here full and satisfied, that is your fault."
"The roast duck is the best I've ever had. Everything is excellent, but I'd go just for the duck! Unfortunately they don't take reservations"
Food was good but the service was slow and un-friendly. Place was packed early but the service was not up to the standards one expects at the Bellagio.
"Simple,quick and efficient. Walk in not a problem. Traditional chinese food,large portions.Staff reasonably efficient.Perfect before a night of gambling and drinking!"
"Good food quite big portions so split, bit more expensive in the hotel than eating out but better service."
"Noodles is located in the casino at the Bellagio and not a place you would notice the first time around, but when you see a line on the side of the high limit tables, you just found Noodles, as there is always a line. The best noodles in Vegas, prepared in many different ways, love the noodle soup and classic deep fried noodles."
"Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup, unfreakin Real, best I've ever had! Ordered it up with Room Service, was Amazing! Everything on this menu is outstanding and authentic. It's a MUST have..."
"So what better food is there after a night out then DIM SUM.  Its a small (to small for vegas) restaurant, but it gets the job done.  The Manager Was GREAT.  Funny, Accommodating, and made sure our table was getting what it wanted.  The rest of the staff was a little rough, but we got through it.

The Dim Sum was more than edible but it wasn't as good as downtown Seattle, not even close to the street vender food in San Fran.  The first steamed humbow was great, the 2nd one had water get into the bun and get it was a little ruined.  That was my only complaint.  

The pork/ crab TASTY

The shuimai was great, you can tell they use a better quality meet then the street food, but it lacks the funcky chewy porky amazing that you get from stuff that makes street food street food.

If you like Dim Sum and your at the Bellagio, its a good stop!"
"Of course this place has been Americanized in some recipes and the ingredients, but if you are smart or lucky enough to get good recommendation, you will end eating delicacies just if you were in Asia. No wonder why this place is always packed."
"A small restaurant so get there early.  We chose the Prix Fixe menu with one appetizer, soup, and a main course for $29. The food was good and the portions were very generous.  We had sweet & spicy beef and chow mein. When we left there was a line that I'd estimate was half an hour long."
"Waited in line for at least 30 min for what we thought would be a nice meal. We were fooled.
1 / asked the waiter about a curry was told it was Malaysian that's it.
2 / Kung Pao Chicken was tasteless, and had an entire red onion in it.
3 / Website said Dim Sum was over at 3pm but it was on the menu. When asked waiter said yeah they had some and walked away.

Panda Express would have been a better alternative."
We were really looking forward to our meal in Noodles restaurant in Las Vegas.  We waited in line for over 40 minutes for a table and were then disappointed with the quality of the food. Would not return to this restaurant.
"We ate here 2x during our 4 day trip to LV.  We were here previously 6 years ago, and were excited to come back.  For starters I must say were came both times during lunch.  No issues with waiting or anything else.  Service was great, no issues.  

Food... good, if not great.  I had the dumpling soup once and the seafood pho soup.  Both were great.  Looking forward to come back."
"We could not get into the Jasmine because of their dress code (long pants for guys).
So we went to Noodles. We were seated very quickly and then sat and sat. We only ordered two main dishes, one was Singapore noodles which had a total of two shrimp and a small amount of barbecue pork and lots of noodles. The other dish was barbecue pork and noodles, and again lots of noodles, little meat. Too much money for this food even in Vegas and very slow service."
"I've seen long lines and heard of hour long waits to eat here. It's good, but in no way unique enough to be worth waiting that long for especially when there are so many other restaurants in town that do the same thing just as well.

I went for lunch around 1pm during my last visit and had no wait at all. I had the calamari appetizer followed by the beef brisket noodle and both were very good although a bit pricy which is expected in Vegas.

I would recommend this restaurant during off peak hours for lunch or dinner but only if the wait is short."
"we went here for an after show meal. as there were only the two of us we decided to forego the family style dishes and opted for the Prix Fixe menu that consisted of wonton, potsticker, and chow mein. the wonton's were delicious but the potsticker tasted like it had ground balony as a filling, and the chow mein was exon valdez worthy in terms of a grease spill. outrageously greasy. Perhaps had we ordered the more traditional chinese fare we would have been more pleased"
This is a must stop for me every time I'm in Vegas.  The wait does get long especially when they offer Dim-Sum but it's totally worth it.  The service is great and the food is delicious.  I always get their Penang Fried Flat Noodles.  Soooooo good!
Our wait was short due to the time we ant--around 11:30 PM.  We just needed something quick and good.  Pad Thai with shrimp was very good--and the others in my party go similar stuff and enjoyed it as well.  I was not cheap--but just what we needed at the time.
Long wait. Slow services. Bad food. Better off going to the fast food drive in. And I hate fast food.
"Nice to have a noodle restaurant in the hotel but overpriced and service was slow that day.  There are many other better restaurants to choose from in the area. As I recall, there is a decent noodle restaurant either in Treasure Island or Mirage, can't recall at the moment."
On weekends they offer a very nice dim sum lunch.  We shared 3 small plates from the dim sum carts and then ordered a noodle dish to share.  I only wish I knew there were several carts passing through the restaurant and we could tried a few more options.
"Had a lovely lunch in Noodles, we had some dim sum as an appetiser I followed this with Vietnamese noodle soup and sweet and my wife spicy chicken. Both courses were served efficiently and were very tasty. The portion size were on the large size as you come to expect."
"It amazes me that people in Vegas queue for so long for restaurants. This is not a criticism of Noodles specifically, because it was the same story in many places that we visited. However, after completing our meal, we really didn't see the value in waiting or the price paid.

The service was good, the beer was authentic and the food arrived in a timely manner. However, the quality of some of the dishes was not up to scratch. The dim sum and soup were very good but some of the noodle dishes were particularly greasy. I had a beef chow mein and was surprised at just how tasteless the beef was - it didn't look or taste appetising at all. My partner had spare ribs and found them tricky to negotiate. 

We left feeling disappointed at the cost and time we had to wait to get in, but if you can get in quickly and you know the menu, you'll probably have a better experience than us."
"Absolutely loved the food at Noodles! There is usually a wait to be seated if you are trying to eat during peak times. It's well worth the wait! Great spring rolls, won ton soup and delicious chicken with veggies! We loved the food so much the first time we went back for lunch 2 days later!! The wait staff is very helpful."
"Like most people said, this place isn't anything special, but, if you have a craving for noodles and are around the Bellagio area (this place is located inside the Bellagio), come try it out.

The food was nothing spectacular, but the food quality and quantity was okay (a bowl of noodles was expensive, about $15-20 per bowl). Are there better places, sure, but this place was convenient for me. I would go back again.

Went on a Wednesday about 7 p.m. (two people) and there was a 20-minute line."
"Very informal.  Almost canteen-like.  However, thoroughly enjoyed my food, Vegetable tempura was delicious as was main course of slightly spicy beef with peppers and onions."
"This was our 40th anniversary trip.  We chose our restaurants carefully.  We also love Asian food so really looked forward to our Noodles experience.  The won ton soup?  Be prepared.  They call it authentic.  It was just plain fishy.  I sent mine back, and so did my husband.  They poured a little chicken broth in and it was still fishy.  We also had the pad thai.  Not bad flavor ---- but a plate full of beige.  No color and not eye catching.  For spending $80, it was a downer.  Don't go!"
"Visited about 6.30pm on a Wednesday & it wasn't too busy. We waited just a few minutes for a table & the staff were very polite & friendly.
Plenty of choice on the menu.
The main course portions were quite large and represented good value for money."
"Whilst the food we ordered was tasty, we could not help but notice that the dishes that contained rice or noodles were substantially larger. Our Sea Bass and Duck meals nice but not filling."
"Excellent noodles for this small restaurant in the bellagio. Large choice in the menu, staff very nice, large quantity with one plate! To be tasted!"
"The hotel staff recommended this restaurant and we were looking forward to a good dining experience but it was a complete let down. Will not recommend this place. Bellagio has many other restaurants, try one of them."
"Great value, fantastic broths in the noodle soups. Portion size is huge! Too many tasty things on the menu to choose from. All kinds of noodles and soups to sample. Come with a crew so you can taste all the great variety!"
"I asked for a crab rice, awful, the only thing I could taste was the greasy flavor of the egg, my husband beef soup disgusting, Please go to noodle shop at Mandalay, I made a mistake thinking it was the place"
I didn't have much time and wanted to grab a quick lunch here.  Efficient but friendly service and the food was delicious.  They had lots of veggie options too
"Had a descent meal that wasn't anything out of the ordinary compared to your typical Asian cuisine, though the price will have me think twice about returning."
Convenient since it’s in the hotel but the food was average at very high prices so overall disappointment. service was average. Recommend a miss.
"The food and the service was great. However, we waited in a queue for approx. half an hour to get in.
Price was reasonable and once we were in and our order was take the staff were quick and always around if you wanted anything without actually hanging around your table."
"Had a descent meal that wasn't anything out of the ordinary compared to your typical Asian cuisine, though the price will have me think twice about returning."
"I laugh when I see reviews from folks ordering anything else other than noodles in this little restaurant.  What is the name of the restaurant again?  Noodles.  Yes, that's what you should order.  That's what tastes the best in here.  Discovery this place walking around Bellagio and decided to give it a try.  Waited about 5 minutes to be seated.  Typical Chinese restaurant service, not exceptional but not bad either.  My wife and I both order noodles.  We loves them.  The noodles were cooked right, flavor was great, just the way it should taste.  Remind me of the noodles we had in Macau.  Believe me, my wife and I are both Chinese, we know authentic Chinese food.  The price was a bit high, but you have to remember where you are, in Bellagio, nothing is cheap there.  But here, you got what you pay for.  Good good.  At least we think so.  In fact, we went back the next day for lunch.  Still awesome noodles.  Next time in Vegas, whether staying in Bellagio or not, we would come here if we want noodles.  Yum."
"I used to come here often when I was in Vegas in the past.  So, I decided to try it again for lunch. The place was not packed during the lunch rush.  

We ordered the wonton noodle soup, a chicken, a shrimp chow mein and potstickers.

the potstickers were good.  The wonton noodles were average.  They used to have some of the best wonton noodles around anywhere.  Now, the noodles didn't seem like egg noodles at all as they seemed pretty pale in color but he wonton were good.  The chow main were not good at all.  The noodles were soggy and lacked flavor."
"My husband and I waited in line for about 10 minutes before being seated. Our waiter was an older gentlemen who was kind and attentive before being bombarded with four to five new tables.

My husband ordered the black pepper beef and asparagus dish, which was delicious and cooked perfectly. I was disappointed with my order sesame chicken, which was supposed to be a bit spicy but was too sweet with too much sauce.

The item we enjoyed was the vegetable spring rolls but I felt they weren't worth $3 for each roll. Overall, I was disappointed with my sesame chicken dish. Spend $20 to $25 (per person) on a buffet -- better value."
"We were there on a Sunday at about 12:30 in the afternoon.  It was dim sum time which excited us since we love dim sum.  We only waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated, but we were seated at a counter spot and felt right in the way of the carts as we were across from the service counter (where the napkins and glasses are) and every single time a cart stopped by us, we were left waiting while the cart had to keep moving for people to walk by.  Our service wasn't super-friendly at all (we had just arrived in Vegas and were in really cheerful spirits so it was a letdown).  We felt like they wanted us to get out as fast as possible.

The dim sum was not remarkable.  The best was the steamed pork bun and shumai dumplings.  The worst were the chicken feet (cold and gummy) and some really gummy fried dumplings.  And it added up quickly.

I would not return."
"We opted for the more casual restaurant for dinner and chose Noodles.  The line was long, the service spotty, and the food was expensive for what you got.  $20 for a plate of fried rice.  I felt sorry for the couple next to us as they received virtually no service."
"This restaurant is at the Bellagio, so the atmosphere is amazing. The air smells wonderful as you await your food's arrival. I had the dim sum, shrimp balls, and barbecued pork spare ribs. For an American place, I would say it is pretty good."
"Went on a Tuesday night. We waited 45 minutes and we're finally seated. The wait service seemed rushed. The food was rather expensive and my noodles were not fully cooked. For this price my noodles should at least be cooked. When I asked for a to go box, they insisted that they would box it for me. Unfortunately they put the empty shrimp tails with my noodles which made for a crunchy leftover meal. Overall the flavor was good."
We ate here 3 times in the 5 days we were at Bellagio. the dim sum and XO noodles are ridiculously good and the service was just like a cantonese place should be.
"We had to line up for 30 minutes but this seems quite comon in Vegas when its busy. We decided to have the set dinner menu which has limited choices but was a reasonable price. 

We were very happy with our selections and really enjoyed the food with the Shrimp Wonton Soup the highlight. 

The food was a welcome relief to burgers and fried food."
"Review - We asked a taxi driver for the best Chinese in Vegas, he said Noodles but it is quite expensive.

We were greeted to a 15 minute wait at 11pm (tells you this place is popular) the wait seemed long but we waited none the less.

The girl who seated us spoke perfect English, our server spoke shall we say broken English. We ordered 2x spring rolls and 2x satay chicken amongst four of us which was ample to get us ready for our main. The problem was the satay chicken came out after 30 mins whilst other couples were being seated after us and getting there starter/main before us. Once the satay chicken arrived the spring rolls were no where to be seen, after asking a member of staff where the spring rolls were I was informed we hadn't ordered them (wrong answer) the manager brought two lots 2 minutes later on the house, still a bad start but dealt with the issue in a fair and timely manner.

The mains were huge and really the waitress should have made us aware of this as one dish could feed 3 people. Some might say it's not there job but in 10 days this is the only restaurant I feel should feel obliged to say. Anyway back to my dish for $32 there was ample meat although it was a touch salty (chicken/duck/pork) The taxi driver advised this chef is top drawer and from New York, he might well be but I can only stand by my uneducated taste buds. Actually, one more point if you get seated near the door (like we did) you may well feed uncomfortable with people watching you eat. The queue should be kept outside the doors not next to a table."
"Firstly we waited 30 mins to get seated, I didn't mind this as it was suppose to be worth it. 

Once we were seated we we're sat right next to the door and the people cuing we're stood right next to our table which was very unprofessional. 

Then a lady took our order and to say she spoke limited English would be kind. So it was a struggle to get across what we wanted. 

After waiting 30 mins.. Yes, 30 mins for a starter! We complained and then it came straight away and we was missing our springs rolls because surprise surprise the lady didn't put them on the order! 

Then our main meal came out 2 mins after the starters and one dish could of fed an entire family which we wasn't told so there was a lot of wasted food. 

The meals aren't cheap, a dish of rice is $18!!! 

We didn't tip and we couldn't get out of there quick enough! 

Give this place a miss!!!"
"Open til around 2AM, so great place to grab a bite after the show! Very nice selection of soups, ranging from Miso, to udon. Food ranges from tempura to more traditional stir fry selections with rice noodles."
This was a pretty decent restaurant with reasonable prices and ok food. We got the prix fixe menu and it was ok but not exceptional. It was priced right though at about $30 each for 3 courses. The main course was a little bit oily but good.
"This was one of the best meals we had in Las Vegas, the staff were friendly and attentive.  The food was lovely and it seemed to arrive at the table before you had ordered it, they were so quick.  We chose a few items on the menu and everyone shared and it was all very very nice.  Will definitely return next time we are in Las Vegas."
"The queue is badly managed, the food is rather tasteless. I am used to authentic Chinese in London and this is a poor relation. Staff have limited English, and I received abruptness to the point of being rude. I am surprised the Bellagio permit this as service everywhere else was of the quality I would expect."
Noodles at Bellagio in Las Vegas has a good selection for those that want a light dim sum lunch. The service is good and efficient.
"This was our third time here.  Couldn't get into any of the other Bellagio restaurants last minute without a reservation, so we went back to Noodles.  Food is good.  Lots of various Asian offerings from Vietnamese noodle soups to Malaysian Roti appetizer (have had better at Penang in Boston).  This particular night the waiting line moved very slowly.  The staff did not seem to be in any rush to clear tables and seat people.  However, it is a good Asian restaurant in a pinch."
"We were a group of six and it was perfect food to share.  The dumplings and dim sums were amazing but I was really disappointed with the Kung Pao Chicken, it was too saucy and not spicy enough."
"Authentic Asian cuisine, but nothing special, probably reflected by the price, not very big inside so there are queues to get in."
"If you like asian, this is a nice place to go. All sort of asian food for a fair price. No need for reservations, just wait in line if there is one. Not a place for romantic dinner but great to eat there before going out."
"Do the Dim Sum lunch at Noodles if you do NOTHNG else in Vegas. This was the most affordable, delicious and fun meal we had while there!!! Some of the carts were hard to wave down but it was beyond worth it!"
"I was staying at the Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay along with my son's family.  We wanted to avoid a cab ride off the property after a long flight so we went to the shopping/restaurant area on the hotel grounds.  My daughter in law said she would like to try the Noodles restaurant.  I nearly never eat American Chinese because of MSG, sugar, fat, and breading.  Generally, I avoid these places, but she wanted to go and she had that beautiful two year old granddaughter, so I said OK.  The place looked nice,  but there weren't many patrons.  We were seated promptly in a roomy booth and the service was very good.  As we looked at the menus, I figured it'd have the Kung Pao Chicken.  Since I'm unfamiliar with the cuisine, it was a shot in the dark, but for the $15.00 menu price, I could go out later and have some REAL food!  When it arrived, it looked and smelled good so I tried it.  It was so good, I dumped my white rice in the ""gravy"" so as to not miss any.  It was very good.  A few nights later I was on a ""date"" with my granddaughter and we were looking for a place to eat, and decided we could do it once more.  I liked it even better the second time...I'm not sure if it had any or all of the objectionable ingredients listed above, but if it does, so be it!  I'm a convert...heap it on!"
"After returning from a 17 day trip to China, then leaving for a long weekend in Vegas, we decided to try Noodles, which was right next to the sports book at the Bellagio.  Great food, great service, a little expensive for what it was though, but can be expected in Vegas."
We'll I ordered chicken chow mein. No vegetables in it basically noodles and three small pieces of chicken. My hubby had the orange chicken and he said it was good. He had way more chicken than I did. Will not go back there. Didn't even get a fortune cookie. And the staff had a scrap right behind us
"This place was lovely - really chilled and quite a cute venue. 
We both had a noodle dish and both have special dietary requirements. I'm gluten intolerant and my friend is vegetarian - they instantly brought us our own special menu's, which we were impressed with. Our meal was very tasty, too."
"You have to try the deep broth bowl it is awesome.  You have to try this place, it's very much comfort food on steroids with out the drug.

very good for the soul!!"
The food was good but very overpriced- like everything in Vegas.  We were looking for a quick lunch between meetings.  If we had more time- we would have gone somewhere else.  Nothing special.
"my expecations were too high for this place as it had been recomended to me by some friends, needless to say I sent them the bill b/c it was not everything that they had said it was.  It was ok; but nothing spectacular."
We were adjusting to East Coast time and wanted to have something light before seeing a show so we ate here.  We eat Asian food very often back home and the food here held up to that.  We had excellent service and food was freshly prepared.  We ate at about 4 pm on a Saturday and the room was nearly full so I suspect it gets busy for dinner.
"It's not just our addiction to Asian food - this place rocks. The variety of the menu, the very basics of the Thai / Vietnamese / Chinese cuisine are put into perfection here. The noodle soups are fantastic, my favourite is the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodles, but the spring rolls and the fried rice are also outstanding. I wish we had the time and the space to try everything on the menu.....!"
"Wow, what a treat! This was the freshest, lightest, Chinese meal I've had in the States. Lovely soft wontons in the soup with juicy huge prawns! Crisp, light, fresh and crunch sorting rolls. Freshest, lightest, noodles I've ever had. Worth the wait, it was a brilliant meal with great service!"
"Our starters were very nice - spring rolls, satay chicken and battered shrimps.  We all went for different noodle dishes for mains. All were fine, but not spectacular.  Tasty enough, but compared to other places we ate, this was probably the only place we wouldn't rush back to, especially with the many other options for Asian cuisine on the strip."
"I visited Noodles to try the Dim Sum, which is available on Fridays and the weekend.  The selection is standard, and the items on the cart are hot (when hot dishes) and fresh.

If you go close to when Dim Sum starts, 11 AM, you can avoid the lines and have your pick of the carts."
"We wanted to try wonton noodle in the Strip based on a friend's recommendation. We happened to pass the restaurant and it looked promising. There was a short queue when we arrived for dinner. Consistent with the look inside Bellagio, the interior also looked upscale. The waitresses spoke Chinese and served us politely.

We ordered wonton noodle and one of the bean curd dish (tofu with mushroom and bokchoy). The noodle was refined and up to the standard expected from an expensive restaurant. The bean curd was rather tasteless but refined nevertheless. We paid about $40 including tax and tip. I'm not sure I'll be back to this place because of the high price tag (would prefer to try other options in the Strip). It was good, but not good value."
"My wife and I were staying at the Bellagio, and this place was recomended by the staff. It was $96.21 (with tip), for the two of us. We were seated quickly, and had our meal within 15 min. It was very tasty, and we could not finish all of it. We will be back."
"We were late to find a place for dinner and wanted to find something without the usual background ""volume"" at Mandalay Bay. We saw the Noodles sign across the casino floor and thought we could have something light. As we entered we were greeted by a shout from friends from China and Taiwan who were already seated. I knew then that the food would be good...and it WAS! Service was fine, there were a wide variety of Chinese choices, and thy all were freshly prepared and delicious.  We had been to Mandalay Bay many times over the past 10 years. and had never stopped in to Noodles before thinking that it was ""just a noodle shop"". We will be sure to visit it on future trips!"
"We have been here a few times.  The food is always excellent and the service always very quick.  Sometimes there is quite a line-up however we try to come either before or after the rush hour. Convenient location, right inside the casino."
"Noodles is a well hidden gem inside the Bellagio. Given my love of Asian cuisine, i had to try it out. I am glad I did. 

The Dim Sum is great with an extensive selection. I had one of her noodle soups and fried rice and they were outstanding. I dare say, equal to if not better than some I had in Hong Kong. 

You must find and try it. You will be glad you did."
"This is a new Asian restaurant in the Bellagio on the Vegas Strip. We went on a weekend day at lunch and got right in. The place was crowded but the service was fast and efficient as the tables turn over quickly. We had Dim Sum, chicken satay, a noodle dish, and a large soup-certainly plenty for both of us. A limited but adequate wine and beer list to complement our dishes. I was a little disappointed in the blandness of the peanut sauce with the Satay, but my wife said it was fine. Otherwise, each dish was very tasty. I am told that the line to get in for dinner can be very long."
"This restaurant is located inside the Bellagio casino. Their foods are pretty good and there are quite many options. The price is more expensive than what you often get in Chinese restaurants but acceptable because of the location. Their staffs are efficient and friendly enough. Although some may think they are rude but I do think it is just a cultural difference. 
They have togo option which is very convenient if you stay close by and want to avoid the line. I stayed at the Bellagio so I just called and ordered what I wanted. Twenty minutes later I came down to pick the food up and enjoyed them comfortably in my room. The foods were still hot and tasty."
"We went here on our last day in Vegas around lunch time. I'm so glad we waited the 20 min to be seated. The restaurant is small but cozy. Polite staff.We had the shrimp dumplings, chow mein mandarin noodles with chicken, and the fried rice with beef. Yes, this place is pricey but the portions are huge and can be shared. Definitely try the hot tea! It was perfect after 4 days in Vegas. This will be on our go to places on our next trip! Thanks again!!"
Service was good. Seated immediately and served right away. Had the Soup of the day and a Calamari dish. Soup was flavorful but the chicked in it was just chopped pieces and had the bone fragments still there. Do not appreciate having to pick the bones out of my mouth while eating at a restaurant. Calamari was lightly breaded rings with a sauce. No flavor whatsoever. Must drench in the sauce to get any flavor. Will try other restaurants in the area next time. No reason to go back.
I always eat here at least once on every Vegas trip.  It's expensive but what isn't in the Bellagio.  We had a late lunch this time instead of dinner and it's wasn't as good as normal but still a must eat for me.
Great food and service for a quick reasonable meal. Try the Mongolian noodles- One of the best dishes on the menu
"Someone had recommended this place to me but unfortunately I did not like one thing we had ordered, in fact everything we had was pretty awful. How can you mess up this type of food if that's what you specialize in? Tasted like one of those low budget Chinese/Vietnamese buffets to me. Will not be going back."
"We waited for 40 min to get in and were very disappointed with the quality of food. Vegetable spring rolls were mushy inside, pad tai and chow mein were mediocre at best. For the price we paid we could have had better food in a buffet."
"Enjoyed dim sum for the first time.  Great selection to choose from. The place was very busy, but we were offered seating at  the ""bar"" which turned out to be the fun place to sit!  Food is very good,"
"We went here for dinner before a show. It was by far the best meal I have ever eaten. The service was good, quick and efficient. If you like Asian food, you have to try this."
Ate here twice during a stay in March 2014. Great Dim Sum and it was as good at 12.30am as it was at 8.00pm
One of the more affordable options at the Bellagio. Don't miss the Fri-Sun 11 - 3 pm dim sum! The Pad Thai was quite good as well. Small and cozy restaurant with authentic service!
"Had this as a late dinner, while staying at Bellagio.  My parents are Malaysian and I have been back a few times.  I had the Laksa which was surprisingly authentic. I was not expecting much, but it was pretty impressive. Of course, it was not comparable to actual Laksa from Malaysia & Singapore, but this was quite tasty. There were a lot of ingredients in it besides from just noodles which made the dish very filling. However, it was $20 for a bowl of noodles is very expensive. I only ate the Laksa, so I cannot comment on the quality and authenticity of the other dishes."
The food was truly very good. The restaurant was clean and staff was friendly .After visiting the Paris hotel and really not in tired to eat anywhere there I found a place that was healthy and very good
"Short wait for a table for two on a busy Thursday night. Friendly service.
The Singapore noodles and chicken Kung po were both very good and plenty of food for two people to share without an appetiser. Reasonable prices. Good for groups or couples. Would be happy to visit again."
"We had a late night snack at Noodles, and found the food and service to be excellent.  Its probably one of the better late night options available at Bellagio.  It’s not the most inexpensive option, but great food never comes cheap.  I would have no problems dining there in the future."
"Ordered a deep fried noodle dish, it looked ok when it arrived.  Tasted it and was very disappointed, it lacked any flavour, spoke to the server and she said I should order another dish.   I ordered Singapore noodles.  This dish was better but definitely not the quality I would expect.  Without sounding too harsh, I've had better Chinese food at the local fast food shopping mall at a quarter the price.  This was not what I expected for a restaurant that was not expensive but not cheap either.  I would not recommend and I wouldn't go there again."
"Like the atmosphere and the food is awesome.  Pea shooters, cucumbers, dim sum on weekends, big huge bowl of noodles, wish I could have taken to room for later!! Wait staff is fast and excellent service"
"There is a reviewer who called this a crap fusion restaurant. However, I don't think it's fusion at all! Some of the rice and noodle dishes are authentic; nothing in the menu suggested that it's fusion cuisine. I'm not sure if they make their own noodles but the noodle dishes I had tasted fresh with good texture. I go there every time I'm in Vegas."
"There were 12 in our Party and everyone left satisfied with the Noodles Experience.    The Dim Sum was great, highly recommend the shrimp."
The restaurant is a more casual atmosphere and they have a lot of options. Do not order the pad Thai it is not authentic and doesn't have much taste at all.
Menu is extensive and overall food quality is very good.  It can be somewhat pricey if you are very hungry.  I would recommend for light dining and pricing is on the high side for a casual restaurant.
"Had lunch here during our stay at the Bellagio.  My wife had the Hong Kong noodles, she want crazy about the beef or the sauce.  I had the yaki udon noodles with chicken and it was delicious!"
"Noodles was good.  There was a wait, about 20 minutes, and it was an off hour.  Beware of wait time at whatever time you go.  We enjoyed the food here and the service was fine.  They are always busy with a lot of tables so I wonder if that's why some people are annoyed with the service.  As long as the wait staff hustles, I don't mind waiting at all.  We started with the vegetables dumplings, really excellent.  The sweet and spicy noodles…amazing.  Super good, get them.  Hong Kong rice was very good as well.  To me this place is worth the wait and while the service can be a little slow, be patient….it's the volume of folks they have seated that slows them down a bit.,We appreciate you being a loyal guest of Noodles. Our team will be delighted to hear they can make every visit memorable for you. We look forward to your next visit."
"I was the first person to walk in when they opened for lunch.  I took a look at the menu before placing my to-go order.  I started to give her my order when a group walked up to be seated.  The hostess said she would seat them and then take my order.  In the meantime, a large line was forming.  She continued to seat every single table until the entire line was seated before taking my order.  I ordered XO green beans with Chicken and Chicken Chow Mein.  Noodles were over cooked and almost no veggies. XO green beans were disappointing as well.  I expected a sweet and spicy flavor, but it tasted more like the green beans were dipped in soy sauce.,Thank you for choosing Noodles as your dining choice. It is disheartening to hear your stay wasn’t as you hoped. We strive to provide Five Diamond service and do apologize in this instance. I have sent you a private message to further review your experience. I do hope to hear from you and we hope to be serve you in the future."
"30 minute wait to get in and it would have been nice if someone had walked the queue to update diners on the wait time.   Food was decent enough and good value.  Service was good whilst in the restaurant.,Thank you for choosing Noodles and we are glad you enjoyed you dining experience. We do apologize for any waiting periods as we do not take reservations and are based on a first come first served. At certain times they make be a longer wait due to the occupancy. We hope you will dine with us a again in the future."
"We chose Noodles for dinner after seeing the ""O"" show.  We took seats at the counter because it was Super Bowl weekend and the beginning of Chinese New Year!  We were surprised not to have a long wait.  Two appetizers - the chicken satay and sui mai were both very good. The peanut sauce for the chicken satay is really great.  We shared a main dish - Hor Fun with barbeque pork and flat egg noodles in a black bean sauce - terrific!  The portion size was generous; definitely enough for two.,We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your dining experience at Noodles. Our chefs will be ticked to hear you relished the delicious chicken and pork dishes. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future."
"looking for easy-chinese meal, and really enjoyed the dim sum there. Though by the time we went the tray was almost empty but the waiter managed to secure some plates for us. Tried the noodle dishes and it taste great. Only thing is that you need to queue during rush hour..,Our staff is glad to know they met their goal in creating a great experience for you. Our Dim Sum is very popular and we do suggest coming earlier to ensure a quick turn over. We look forward to welcoming you in the near future."
"Living in Seattle I'm used to good Asian food and wasn't disappointed at Noodles. My daughter and I shared the sweet and spicy noodles with chicken and a plate of pan fried pot stickers. The pot stickers might as well have been boiled; they were a bit limp. The noodles on the other hand were spicy, the chicken plentiful and enough vegetables to allow my daughter to get away with saying she'd had a vegetable with dinner. :-)
Our biggest issue was feeling like we were crammed into the restaurant like sardines. Since there were only two of us, they seated us at the counter. More than once I bumped elbows with the woman sitting next to us. At many counters you also have a view of the activity in the kitchen but, nope, not here. You have a wall to face that is literally less than 18"" from your face. The counter seating also meant we had to physically turn around to see the dim sum tray that was seemingly rolled past us every 2-3 minutes. 
If you go, insist on a table. You won't regret it.,Thank you for choosing Noodles as your dining experience. We are glad you and your daughter relished the assorted dishes. We do apologize you were unhappy with your seating area, our staff will me more than happy to seat you in an available area you would feel most comfortable in. On your next travels to Las Vegas do come and see us again."
"Lola stayed home but a fellow bridge player joined me for dinner. One of the regular pro poker players at Bellagio had recommended this place.

  I am going there again tonight.

 Extremely upscale Chinese style  food. Impeccable doting service. We  had hot spicy cucumber and har gow and shiu meu with a premium cold sake. Then hot spinach and garlic and a vermicelli with crab dish. We finished with glasses of a superb reisling acompanied by a plate of duck and pork.

  At $200. for two this place offers value.,We appreciate your friend’s recommendation. Our staff will be thrilled they could help create such a fantastic experience for you and you enjoyed the delicious menu items. We look forward to welcoming you back."
"Ever since I discovered Noodles has Dim Sum on the weekends, we have made it apart of every trip to Vegas. We have been there 3 times in the last 12 months and it is fabulous. I can't vouch for their other food, I am sure it is fine but it is the same stuff you can get anywhere. Dim Sum, real Dim Sum is something you can usually only get in ""China town"". We have been to Dim Sum in Seattle (our home city) and it is tough to get to, always crowded, and no one speaks English. So it is hard to ask questions. So the best part of Dim Sum at Noodles is that it has all of the classic dim sum dishes (steamed and pan fried dumplings, pork and shrimp dumplings, shrimp balls, etc) and some chef specials that are reasonably priced with people who will tell you what everything is and no rush. I think if you have never had dim sum before it is the best atmosphere for a first timer and if you love dim sum like us it is a great place to enjoy it while in Vegas without leaving the strip. Dim sum is sort of like Chinese breakfast tapas. You get a lot of different bites and it's pretty cheap. We literally gorged ourselves and it was like $60 bucks with tip. This is more than it would be in Seattle since they have some specialty dim sum items that run $6-8 and in Seattle none of the items are over 5 but it was well worth it. One of the items was a scallop dumpling (chef special) and the other was a lotus leaf full of sticky rice stuffed with an assortment of Chinese meats. So yes,  everyone eat dim sum! They offer it weekends 11-3 but earlier is better.,Thank you for the wonderful review and we are ecstatic our Dim Sum keeps you coming back for more. Our chefs take much pride in creating flavorful dishes. We do not take reservations at Noodles so we would suggest an earlier arrival. We look forward to seeing you again for our Dim Sum."
"Good selection of Noodle soups and other dishes. Service is fast and courteous and the portions are big. You can get by with just eh soup and make a meal of it. Try it with duck.,We are thrilled you chose Noodles as your dining selection. Our staff does their best in getting our guest served quickly and efficiently. We are glad you enjoyed the duck with the soup and trust you will be back again."
"Great noodle bowls and they even had watermelon juice. So many wonderful dishes and got so stuffed had to take nap after. Ha! 
Not too pricey. The juice was kinda high,Thank you for choosing Noodles as your dining selection. We are delighted you relished the scrumptious noodle bowls and enjoyed the refreshing watermelon juice. On your next visit to Las Vegas we look forward to welcoming you back."
"For the price and quality of food, you are better off going to Panda Express. The food is below average and over priced. Also, after the chefs prepare food, they put it on a counter where it waits for the waiters to pick up as customers walk back and forth by the food. We thought that was unsanitary.,We appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your recent dining experience at Jasmine. It is disheartening to hear your visit wasn’t as you hoped. Our food is made to order and our chefs would be more than happy to alter any items on the menu to satisfy your liking. We have various items on the menu we hope you can come back in the future to explore the delicious dishes."
"Every time we come here we are glad we did. The food is always top notch.  The service may not always be the best but you cannot argue with perfect dumplings and noodles.,Thank you for visiting Noodles once again. Our chefs will be glad they can create perfect dumplings and noodles that satisfy your taste. On you next visit to Vegas we hope to see you again."
"Food was delicious, large portions and cooked perfectly.  Service was great and we got seated every time we visited relatively quickly.  It's a small restaurant so tables are close, but for the price and quality of the food and service I'd say it's a must (especially if you're staying at the Bellagio).  Don't miss Dim Sum...it's the best!,We appreciate you being a loyal guest of Noodles. Our team will be delighted they can create an unforgettable experience each time you visit. Thank you for recommending the Dim Sum, it is our most popular amongst our guest. We look forward to your next visit."
"We were hungry.  There were lines everywhere.  We didn't want to spend a fortune, and didn't want to battle traffic trying to find our way to another restaurant.  So, we ate at Noodles.  

Food:  We tried three different dishes.  Each one was tasty, and portions were unexpectedly large.  Good job here.

Service:  Not friendly, let's say.  Water and a bit of soup broth spilled on us due to the energy with which items were slapped on the table.  Maybe we didn't look like high-rollers and they needed the table turned.  We definitely were there during a shift change (around 6 p.m.), which accounted - we think - for some of the slowness.

Overall:  Food was decent, but the ""not happy to see you"" atmosphere was sobering."
"There is a wide variety of options on the menu. The won ton soup with nood;es is almost a meal in itself and we should have shared it. The pad thia with chicken and the Mongolian beef were both wonderful. The wait staff were both friendly and professional. As with most restaurants in the Bellagio Hotel, the prices were on the high side but the freshness of the food made up for it. Although the restaurant is just off the casino floor, once you enter you forget that and you do not hear the casino noise at all. A great option if you are trying to keep your food budget in line."
"We ate an early dinner at Noodles and had a variety of dishes two of us shared.

Hot Jasmin Pearl Tea was excellent and the perfect drink for our meal.  We started off with the Shiu Mai (5 Cantonese steamed shrimp and pork dumplings) which were very average.  I liked them and my mother didn't.  Next was Char Siu Pau (4 steamed barbecue pork buns) which were small, but excellent) and then Sesame Chicken.  We order it mild but it should have been ordered with a bit of heat as it was good, but too sweet.  We ended our meal with Vietnamese Seafood Pho (shrimp, fish ball, fish cake, bean sprouts, cilantro, chicken stock).  This was a total disappointment.  Where was the fish sauce?  Where were the bean sprouts?  Too many noodles and not enough broth.  This is nothing like true Pho.   $85 for the meal ... expect to spend $80-$100 for two people and a lot will depend on your drinks. 

They do have a huge selection of items to order, so there will be something to please everyone.  The selection of beer and drinks are impressive.  

The biggest negative was a group of people who were loud, obnoxious and obviousness to the disruption they were having on the entire restaurant.  Management should have said something to them.  We ended up finishing up quickly to get out of there.  So what should have been a fun, relaxing, leisurely meal ended up being anything but.

Service wasn't good.  Had to catch our server's attention to order our food (we ordered one item at a time while we decided what to have next).  Then had a hard time flagging her down for our check."
"We had an excellent late evening meal at Noodles and were at no point made to feel that the late hour was a problem. Like all restaurants at the Bellagio, this is no cheap option, especially with $20 bottles of beer but it is an experience. The menu is varied and has some individuality about it. Best to book if you are planning an early or mid-evening meal."
Tasty Dim Sum...... Varying noodles dishes from different regions.....After long nite of gambling and drinking the noodle soups will help will revitalize your body.....The Pad Thai is very good and the fried pot stickers are a must.....
"Noodles offer’s a great atmosphere for a midnight snack since the other restaurants close around 10/11pm. They have a great variety on the menu, you a sure to find something you would like to try. Also, they offered a variety of drinks from their full bar."
"When the other restaurants in the Bellagio were closed, tried this place.  Authentic food served by nice staff.  Had the soy sauce noodles wok fried with shrimp, and also a side of choy sum with oyster sauce (nice waiter offered me a half-order on this even though I did not read one was available).  Delicious."
"We had a nice lunch at Noodles.  I had a house fried rice and the other person in my party had a noodle dish.  One Tea and a coke...$50. 

The place was crowded, felt impersonal and like they were just trying to feed us.  Service was just OK.  I had to flag someone down for the bill.  

When in the Bellagio, not a bad choice if you like Asian food.  Expensive with average service."
Quick eats . We like the soups and steamed dumplings. Nothing fancy here: just good quick food. You can sit down. It is not a food court. It is just not gourmet with a lot of ambience.
"We recently got married at Bellagio and we met with family for lunch at Noodles. We enjoyed some of the dim sum and the Pad Thai was excellent. However, the pho was not very good but perhaps we have been spoiled by eating pho on the streets in Hanoi!  We did appreciate the good service and the effort to accommodate our large party in this small restaurant. Some of our party enjoyed the food enough to go back a second time. this is a good place to eat at the Bellagio if you are looking for a lighter meal.,Congratulations on your recent celebration of eternal vows. We are delighted you were able to join us on this special occasion and savored the Dim Sum and Pad Thai dishes. Our team will be thrilled they were able to create an unforgettable experience for you and we hope to welcome you back in the future."
"This is a small, Asian restaurant in the Bellagio hotel.  I had to rate this as only very good since the staff was indifferent at best.  Once our food was delivered, we were never approached by our waiter without our asking.  The food was excellent, though."
Chinese - Japanese restaurant. There was 8 of us so we all ordered various food choices and shared.  Had the fried and boiled noodles.  Fried Shrimp which was probably my favorite.  The duck had very little meat on it and too many tiny bones.  Lamb was good.  Curry chicken seemed to be the favorite on our table.  Great spicy kick to its taste.  The fried chicken pieces was very dry. Is expensive but worth trying.  Décor is really unique and different.
"Although the staff seems overworked, the place offers rather good Asian food, albeit somewhat Amercanised. The dim sum chef did not have a great day, but we were quite late. There is a notable difference between the quality of the dishes, but crispy duck is supposed to be crispy.,Thank you for choosing Noodles as your dining selection. We are delighted you were able to join us for Dim Sum and do apologize some of your items were not as you wished. Our staff would be more than happy to recreate or alter any dishes for your liking. On your next Trip to Las Vegas we hope to welcome you back."
"We popped in her after a show and were able to be seated within 15 minutes which seems fast for Vegas.  The miso and shrimp soups were delicious and the pad tai and sweet and spicy noodles were very good and had a nice bite to them.  Spring rolls were a little doughy so I would pass on them in the future.  Our service was excellent, water was plentiful and dishes were timed well.  A little bit Americanized from authentic noodle shops but a very nice meal with large portions."
"After a very disappointing lunch at Red 8 in the Wynn Hotel we took one my sot at dim sum in Noodles in the Bellagio Hotel. Boy are we glad we did.

We were looking for a light dinner before our evening show and this was just what we were looking for.

We wnet back to basics. Sauteed veggies, some unique offerings and something they call seafood warpped in tofu skin and it was good beyond anything we would have expected.  

Okay, this is not out ""best bet"" in LV for a good dinner, but it was not far behind the best. Give it a go and you will not be disappointed. Be advised if you do not get there early you will stand in line and wait to be seated. For a restaurant just off the casino floor, this was exceptional."
"My wife and I ate here after getting married, we both love Asian food but this was one of the best Asian meals that we've ever had. That includes eating in Hong Kong."
"Ate here on third evening of our stay. Good election of dishes, I selected the salt and pepper shrimps very tasty and big portion."
"I wasn't sure on going here as I heard it was not that good but, once I went in there and I saw it was full of asian people I started thinking it might be a good place. And it was.
The food is tasty and the portions are huge, so make sure you are hungry! It is true that the staff make mistakes with the orders (not with us, we were lucky (: ) so watch out when you get your order at the table.
Good value for money."
"We had Pad Thai and Sweet and Spicy Noodles with some tea.  Everything was very good and we enjoyed the atmosphere.  It was early and not quite a packed house for lunch.  We were the only Americans in the whole place and I took that as a good thing.  The wait staff was very helpful but our order was kinda straight forward.
The place smells delicious and that is reflected by the food.  A few of the tables nearby were a little snobby but that did not bother us.  It can be expensive if you let it but we were full at the end.
We'd return and be a little more open minded with our orders.  I've tried some exotic Asian cuisine and this is middle of the road."
"we had vegetable fried rice, fried rice combo ( seafood ), egg flower soup. Every dish was good. ( the fried rice was a little dry on one occasion and perfect on the other. so it depends on your luck ). clean and quiet place. you can watch the action on the big screens while you eat. 

no traditional fortune cookies at the end !"
We took a break from gambling for mid afternoon lunch and ordered a combination of Dim Sum and dishes including the Pad Thai and beef with a black bean sauce.  With no alcohol our bill was over $100 for three people so definitely recommend paying with comps if you can.  The food was nothing special--something that could be found in most middle America Chinese restaurants.  Don't expect a special find like you find stumble upon in San Francisco or NYC.
"Huge menu, delicious food, found some of the traditional favorites but also some new exciting dishes. Service was nice, restaurant is located in the Bellagio, prices are good for the qualify of the food. Share the portions as they are huge!"
Good food and swift service.  Portions are huge so considering splitting the noodle dishes.  I suggest skipping the appetizers... they taste like something you could get at your local chinese restaurant.
"Was excited about the dim sum--but was disappointed. The noodles themselves were fresh, though--but I've had better."
"Nice restaurant in the Bellagio.  Prices were wonderful for the quality and service!  Try the Duck, it was scruptious!"
"I believe that my dish must have set under a heat lamp for quite some time... it arrived barely warm and the noodles were clomped together, hard and chewy.  Yuck."
Really lovely food and very reasonable price. Very popular though so would advise to book in advance
I was really hungry for a late night snack and grabbed some Pad Thai to go and was blown away! The portion was large but the flavors really stood out. Wish I would have gone again to try all the other items on the menu.
"Feel like stroganoff but worked all day and you are tired?  Stop in here and pick it up, fresh and hot. You can add beef or chicken to your order, for just a bit more.   There are several types of pasta and sauces to choose from and a variety of proteins to add. Salads are good and food is well prepared."
"We enjoyed our dinner but felt the food was average yet quite expensive.  We decided to order their soup, appetizer, noodles and a tofu dish.  Their miso soup was delicious but their Penang noodles were quite mushy and too salty. Tofu was passable."
"great little cheap find in the Venetian, looked it up on urbansppoon/tripadvisor as wanted good noodles on the strip, yes you can get cheaper and probably better in the Chinatown area but if you want to stay on the strip this place is surprisingly good and good value (which is all too rare on the strip these days)"
"We sat near the Bellagio walkway and enjoyed watching the people. I got the Carpaccio appetizer, which was very good. My wife got the chicken dinner which was very average. Service was fine."
"expecting a bit more than dated atmosphere and ambivalent servers. Late lunch-pre dinner. Chose pork dumplings...super fluffy-but filling overly sweet and not enough meat, boring side sauce. Tempura  crisp and fresh but also bland...presented without any sauce. Bar seating has great view of dish washing area and piled up trays. My waiter very pleasant (others seemed haggard), pricey for product and presentation. Other dishes looked a bit more interesting, but clientele not overly excited. A  tad disappointing based on other reviews!"
stayed in the bellagio for two weeks in june we dined at noodles we were not impressed at all overpriced and long wait left most of the food  much better places to dine in vegas.
"This was my first time to dine here, but I will definitely return on my next visit.  The freshness of the food was amazing. The noodle bowls were very good and a large variety on the menu.  Sometimes a long line, so ask if you can eat at the bar, shorter wait time.  I will return."
"Definitely one of the best and most memorable meals of the holiday. The food was all delicious without exception, we would especially recommend the chow mein. There is often a long queue outside so expect a little wait but the food is worth it! Quite expensive, but again, the food is so good it doesn't matter! Will definitely be returning!"
Asked to reserve at Noodles and was told no reservations are taken and I had to make the line and wait. After 20 minutes in line I approached the hostess and asked if there was an estimated time. She replied that everyone just sat down and that it would at least take 30 minutes. Neither to say I was very dissappointed and ended up going somewhere else.
"Had a dinner here before the ""O Show"". The food is really good but seems to have MSG as during the show, we were all very thirsty. The food is very very expensive! Almost $20 a medium sized noodle bowl. But seating and environment is calm."
"We ended up going to Noodles 3 times during our visit!  It was a great spot for lunch or an after-midnight snack.  The steamed shrimp dumplings were incredible, and they also have great pot stickers.  The soups are very generous and they have a large variety to choose from, as well as noodle dishes and fried rice.  The wait staff were very friendly and helpful with suggestions."
"Very good Asian food at reasonable prices for Las Vegas.

They offer some very true Asian dishes. My wife ordered the oxtail soup..and the server pressed her on the fact that it actually had oxtail, which we love, and I often cook. The coup was great and the oxtail rich and fatty.

I had the Singapore curry and it was good. Could have been spicier, but lots of BBQ pork.

Highly recommend Noodles.

One of the more reasonable restaurants in LV."
"Excellent food, but very expensive.  Go to the Noodles at the Venetian and you will get a much better value.  As far as value at the Bellagio, you are better off going to the Snacks counter, which is a good deal."
"If you love Chinese food but your partner loves Thai, then Noodles is the place for you both! They combine a variety of classic Asian dishes, all freshly cooked to order and delivered quickly to your table. It's not a classy restaurant but you'll leave with a suitably full tummy and a feeling of good value for money."
"I liked the service and portions very big but i disliked the taste. The waitress pauline was awsome !!!,We are honored you chose Noodles as your dining destination. Pauline will be delighted to know she helped make your dining experience memorable. It is disheartening to hear you were not satisfied with your meal. Our chefs will always be willing to suggest options for you or alter anything to your taste likings. We hope to welcome you back in the near future."
Order one of the hand stretched noodle dishes.  Good casual lunch place with an amazing atmosphere and good service.
"I you enjoy a good curry in England and can't find one in Vegas, go to Noodles in Bellagio and try their Curry Chicken with boiled rice. It isn't Indian food, but by golly it is really good with a lovely mix of spices and curry heat. Truly recommended!!"
"You can pick any dish on the menu, you cannot go wrong
 Of the dishes we tried and liked: the Chow mein with barbecue pork. And the beef noodle soup, both were Amazing.  
 Perfect place for lunch. (Little bit on the expensive side)"
Order one of the hand stretched noodle dishes.  Good casual lunch place with an amazing atmosphere and good service.
"A great place.  A wide selection of noodle dishes at a good prices.  I will not say 'cheap', but a nice price point for Vegas (15-20$).  The line can be a bit long at times, but they move people through at a nice clip.  Great place for a late night bite."
"When a restaurant is called noodles, the noodles better be good. Let me tell you something, they were AMAZING! There are a lot of reasons why I want to go back to Vegas, and that pad Thai dish is one of them."
"Our family was staying at the Bellagio for a week and wanted to have a reasonably priced meal and still stay in the hotel.  Most of the restaurants inside the Bellagio are absurdly expensive.  We tried Noodles.

There was no wait at 7 PM on a Sunday which should have been a clue.  My 29 year old daughter wasn't feeling well and only got the miso soup which she proclaimed fabulous.  My wife got a chicken dish which she said was just fine.  My 21 year old son was more interested in the Japanese beer but said the food was OK.

I got what I would call Mongolian beef.  Everything but the noodles were very good.  The noodles were undercooked bordering on chow mein crunchiness.  It's like ordering meat and potatoes and the potatoes are inedible.  Overall an average meal at an OK price.  $147 with tax and tip for four.,Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your recent visit to Noodles. We are thrilled to hear you and your family was able to have a lovely evening and we are glad your family enjoyed their meal options. We would like to apologize you were not satisfied with your dish. Our chefs would be more than happy to remake or alter any dish to your liking. On your next trip to Las Vegas we hope to welcome you back to Noodles."
"I knew when I saw the long line of people waiting to be seated at midnight that I wanted to try this place and that it was likely good.  Indeed it was.

Dim sum was the way to go.  I was able to try a variety of small dishes.  Loved the steamed dumplings and the almond crusted shrimp.  My husband had a nice seafood stew. Great Sunday lunch.

Sitting at the bar upfront was also fine, didn't mind it at all.  Cool decor inside as well.,We are delighted you chose Noodles as your dining destination and we are thrilled you savored the Dim Sum option. The almond crusted shrimp is a favorite of our guest and we are ecstatic to know you enjoyed the ambiance throughout the restaurant. We hope to welcome you back soon!"
"Excellent food, service and ambiance makes this a good place to dine.  The menu is extensive and complete for all tastes."
"Went for a quick lunch and it was just ok. Nothing to write home about. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.,We are grateful you chose Noodles for your lunch experience. Our menu has an array of options as we serve authentic regional noodle dishes from Thailand, Japan, China and Vietnam. We hope you may explore our menu on your next trip to Las Vegas to experience our variety of dishes."
"You paid about twice the price but the food is excellent.  Don't miss the soup of the day, Cantonese style soup simmered for hours.  The wonton noodle soup is awesome.  We've visited this place about 8 to 10 times and have never been disappointed with any dish that we ordered."
"Fantastic dim sum
 waited in line for 15 minutes but once we overlooked the poor table management we found out the food was incredible 

Everything was light fresh and extremely flavorful"
"Staff was excellent, but not sure the food was worth the long wait to be seated. The decor is nicely done. Our server was friendly and efficient. Better food at Pei Wei.,Thank you for choosing Noodles as your dining choice. Our staff will be delighted to hear they could help create a memorable experience for you and we are thrilled you enjoyed the ambiance throughout the restaurant. We hope to welcome you back to try other items on our menu that is to your liking."
"This restaurant is very reasonably priced for Vegas. The food was excellent, I had the pad Thai. The portions were a very good size, the restaurant was nicely decorated but the service wasn't excellent."
"We stay at the Bellagio twice a year and always look forward to having lunch at Noodles.  I love the sweet and spicy BBQ pork noodles so much that it's the only thing I ever order.  My husband's go-to dish is the Hong Kong egg noodles.  On the weekends they bring around the dim sum cart where you can choose from many authentic dishes in addition to regular menu items.  The last time we were there, we finally tried the Thai iced tea, which was very good.  I can't wait to go back in December!"
"This restaurant in hotel Bellagio serves the very best food.  We had been here at about 9.30 PM on Friday and it took one hour in the line to get a table.  However we felt the wait was OK when the food was serves.  We had ordered for Malasian Roti, Malasian Fried Rice and shrimp noodles.  Malasian Roti was was very tasty as it just melted down the throat.  The noodles and rice were good too though the place appeared to be crowdy"
"Pros: The food was amazing!! My husband and I shared our meals. He ordered the Sweet and Spicy Noodles and I ordered the chow mein mandarin noodles. Both dishes were excellent! Very fresh and flavorful! We also ordered a side of the BBQ pork and it was to die for. I think that was the best part of our meal. We both looked at each other after taking a bite and we were in foodie heaven! My husband loves thai iced tea and he said the one he ordered there was delicious. Very good food and reasonable prices. 

Cons: We looked through the book in our room at the Bellagio and this restaurant was the only one listed that did not require reservations ahead of time. It specifically stated that reservations were not suggested. We went down pretty late for dinner (10pm), so we thought we would get right in. Boy were we wrong! The line was not exceptionally long, so we decided to wait. The person at the front desk told us it would be about a 15 minute wait to get seated. Boy was he wrong! We stood in line for 45 minutes until we were the next to be seated (not to mention the fact that we had belligerently drunk people in line behind us). We were looking around and there were several tables that were empty, so we figured we would be seated. The gentleman who was seating people started walking towards us to seat us (I swear he even had menus in hand), so we started walking in when the phone rang. He held up his hand to us, put the menus down and proceeded to answer the phone. He then took a to-go order, which took about 5 minutes. We figured we would then be seated, but yet again WRONG! A woman came out from the back of the restaurant and dropped off a to-go back to the man at the desk. The people who were there to pick up that order showed up and he waited on them and cashed them out. By the time that transaction was over the phone rang again. I was getting very annoyed by the fact that we had already waited an hour now and we were starving and hungry. That combination of things just doesn't work for me! The gentleman then went out back before finally coming to seat us. All together we waited 1:15 minutes when we were initially told it would be a 15 minute wait. They could clearly tell the annoyance on my face. Luckily the food was the redeeming quality for this place. I would suggest that anyone who visits here and does not want to wait a long time in line should call in a to-go order because they will wait on you before they wait on anyone standing in line."
"A nice relaxed atmosphere and an opportunity for a little informal dining in Bellagio
The dinner was superb quality and good value"
"Simplicity at its best. 

Had to wait for a while before we were seated, they were busy and the service was rushed. 

The food was good and flavorful and didn't disappoint us. Loved it and would surely go back."
"We did not have to wait to be seated, but we sure had to wait for our food! It took over 75 minutes to be served pot stickers, spring rolls and Udon noodles. We asked why our food was taking so long and was advised it was delayed due to shift change, however a party of seven was seated, ate and left before we received our main entrée and another party of two was seated, ate, paid and left before we were served our simple entrée ordered off the menu. The servers speak broken English were not able to answer simple questions and were not attentive. The steamed pot stickers were good but the spring rolls lacked flavor, were greasy and boring! I have had better spring rolls prepared at home from the freezer! The Udon noodles were stir fried with a few vegetables and were unremarkable. We had Jasmine tea for two ($9) that was mediocre at best. We will not return to this restaurant and Bellagio should be ashamed."
this was a good spot for a quick lunch.  Not too long a wait and reasonable prices.  The food was good and they accommodated a change to the menu item that was much appreciated.
"Noodles, Ballagio Resort & Casino, Las Vegas.  We first ate at Noodles in February of 2011 and so throughly enjoyed our dim sum, that we told many friend going to Las Vegas, that if they had the opportunity, that they owed it to themselves to experience Noodles.  Due to surgeries, we were not able to visit Las Vegas in 2012, but we were just there for a 5 night stay.  The first day, after our arrival, we were chomping at the bit, as they say on the horse farms, to visit Noodles again and we did so for our first lunch.  We had four different dim sums, 3 of which were made with shrimp, which we remembered so well.  What a let down.  I have no idea what could change so drastically, but change it did and it went from one of our highest recommended lunch places to one that we would never, ever think of recommending.  Maybe our first experience was just an exceptional one and maybe our last experience was an unusual one in a bad sort of way, but either way, it will be out last one !!!"
"The tile says it all...

We were craving or some Chinese food.  It was a long wait to get in.  Service was mediocre, and he food was just OK.   I was expecting higher food quality and  more attentive service given the price point."
I usually don't give any negative reviews but this place wasn't very good. Between our appetizers and entree took about 45 mins. Seems like the waiter forgot about us. The food wasn't that good either. Have had much better pad Thai and Singapore noodles else where. Won't be back.
"After waiting in line for about 25 minutes we were really very disappointed.  Service was very slow and only got round to ordering our drinks about 10 minutes after being sat down.  Our server tried to get away but we insisted that we order right then incase of another lengthy delay before we saw her again.

Our meals were slapped down in front of us by a separate very rude server promptly after ordering and we had almost wished they hadn't.  After having watched the in hotel promotional channel about their restaurants and seeing the chef continually rave about how 'YUMMY' all of his food was, we can only conclude that he was very wrong.  The food that was served to us was YUCKY, YUCKY, YUCKY.  We ordered one chicken and noodle dish which was reasonably tasty but was covered in grease.  The other dish we ordered was some kind of beef concoction which tasted nothing like beef, but in fact well-aged fish!  Needless to say the beef was also coated in some kind of grease.

Definitely would not recommend this restaurant and certainly wouldn't go back."
"Easy, somewhat affordable place in the Bellagio to get pretty good Asian noodles of all varieties.  Expect Bellagio prices."
We waited in line about 20 minutes but it was worth it. Our waiter was very friendly and funny. The food was very good. We will definitely return.
Long long wait to be sat next to the kitchen door so I kept getting bumped by staff yet they didn't seem to notice that they never served my husband his food until I was ready to go.  Absolutely horrid experience
"We ate here on our first night in Vegas and we were quite disappointed with what turned out to be some very uninteresting food. 

We ordered two noodle dishes: the waitress cautioned me that the Pad Thai that I ordered was spicy. I can take very very spicy food, but I didn't find any type of chilli or spice in the meal. In fact it was pretty much without any flavour. And in presentation, it looked exactly like the second dish we ordered ... although that dish had some trace flavour to it. 

The third dish we ordered was Gai LAN, which had a nasty background flavour. When the waiter collected the unbeaten Pad Thai, he asked me what I thought as I clearly hadn't enjoyed it. When I let him know that it lacked (any) flavour, he went over to the waitress who had taken our order: she may have been a supervisor/manager ... but I heard her advise the waiter in Cantonese that I didn't like spicy food - my feedback was ignored. 

And at nearly $70 for all that, we at least were left with a sour taste!

I'd say there are plenty of better places to eat!"
"This restaurant has been one of my favorites since the Bellagio opened. I recommend their dumplings, noodle dishes and the steamed Chilean bass."
"Sweet and Spicy noodle were very good as were their dumplings.
Staff was attentive and helpful, food was very good."
"After passing over several more expensive dining options at the Bellagio, my husband and I opted to try Noodles a try (it's located off the main casino area).  It has very limited seating, so we ended up having to sit at the bar area which means you face a walled area.  The food was good, and the portions were generous.  The server did a good job of checking up on us, asking if we needed anything.  Would return again, but next time would like to be seated at a table!"
"After attending the 7:30 pm show of ""O"" at the Bellagio, we decided we needed something to eat. Around the corner was Noodles, an upscale, short wait to get in and what turned out to be a really good restaurant. There were a lot of people around the area and long lines at other reataurants so we decided to try Noodles. We were met with a smiling hostess who showed us to our table after about a 15 minute wait. The menu is simple and the food was fresh. I had the Pad Thai with BBQ pork and it was better than the what I just had in Indonesia. My wife had the Asian Fried Rice with shrimp and it also was delicious along with left overs. We split a Sapporo large beer and the bill came in under $50.00. It made for a perfect evening. The hot sauce was HOT so beware. There are appetizers that can be easily split or even the entree can be split, especially if you get more than one entree. It doesn't appear to be child friendly unless your child likes Asian food. The service was fast and efficient and the food arrived at our table hot with the beer ice cold. A perfect meal.  While waiting to get in, we noticed numerous guest coming in and picking up food to go so it must be know locally as having good Asian type food."
"We visited noodles one evening about 8pm, we had a 30 minute wait for a table as they do not accept reservations but the time passed quickly by people watching!

We were shown to our table near to the kitchen and drinks arrived quickly. The atmosphere was bustling and loud. We felt incredibly rushed during our whole meal with staff hovering to take our order within minutes of being seated.  One of our starters turned up, they forgot the other one so it came with our mains.

The food was tasty and fresh if a little pricey for what it was.  Our bill arrived before we were offered dessert but we happily left, we prefer to be able to relax a little more over dinner than Noodles allowed."
"We went for the Dim Sum, the flavors are good, but by the time they get to your table they are a bit cold!"
"I do like this place and always get the same thing, congee.  The service is ok, but the food is very good.  The restaurant is clean, everything is fresh.  This is a must stop for me every trip."
"We stopped here for lunch and didn't have to wait terribly long.  The food was good, authentic Asian fare with decent drinks.  Pricier than I would usually pay for lunch - anywhere but in Las Vegas.  I'd go back."
"My first time at Noodles - we had made a reservation and it was great to walk straight in to a fabulous table!  Service is excellent.  Nothing too much trouble.  Food was fabulous.  The miso soup was very tasty - we had that with some edaname beans.  The main dishes with noodles were also fabulous - large portions too!  Definitely recommend this, and I'll be going back!"
"Tom Yum soup at its finest. Excellent and quick service. If you are between activities and want something different, then this is the place to try."
"If you enjoy piping hot food and really great service ... this is the place for you . All the dishes we had were very tasty . The service is non-stop and very fast . The portions are generous so its great if you have more people ... then you can try more dishes ... that being said, my husband and I went, and had a few appetizers and then two mains ... very yummy."
"Noodles was a pleasant surprise, Located immediately off the casino floor so it's best to request a table away from the doorway. The smell of sole or casino noise is not an issue.

Service was excellent, staff was attentive, accomodating and knowledgable.

And now about the food. We stopped in for a late lunch and ordered the spring rolls and noodle soup. The spring rolls were very tasty. The noodle soup was excellent, the broth was very tasty without being ""fatty"" and the bowl was filled with roast pork, vegatables and noodles. 

Our portions and of those around us were large and well presented. Prices are ver reasonae making this a high value restaurant.

We would highly recommend"
"After much thought and reflection, I am unable to give Noodles higher than an average rating. 

Pros - the taste of the food is very good, the portions are generous, the wait time is reasonable and the menu choices are varied. 

Cons - there is no lobby or waiting room; you have to queue from the restaurant into the smoky casino. The service is sporadic and impersonal. There is no door or wall between the restaurant and the casino, so disgusting tobacco smoke wafts into the restaurant.,Thank you for choosing Noodles for your dining destination. We are delighted to hear you relished the variety of menu options and enjoyed the delicious noodle dishes. We apologize for the smoke smell you endured due to its location and the level of customer service you received. Noodles is a traditional Asian open kitchen establishment giving the feel of a family style restaurant. We will pass along your comment to our management team for review and hope to welcome you back in the future."
"Great food, reasonably priced. A bit cramped in bits but excellent service overall. Would definitely recommend."
"Always visit when in vegas, had the Oxtail soup and BBQ pork & duck combo. All was just soooo good. So hard to choose from the menu. Just so many great choices."
"I like going to this establishment as I am always able to find something on a Chinese menu that I recognize from home. The portions are well sized and tasty. This is my go to place when I want to relax and not have to over dress to eat a meal.,We appreciate your continuous loyalty to Noodles and are delighted to hear of your comfort level in being able to find dishes recognizable from home. It is nice to hear you are able to relax and discover a delicious dish from our menu. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!"
Beautifuly decorated. Great food. Very authentic but confortable and kids friendly. Definately coming back for more.
"stopped here for a quiet dinner and loved the food! It took a while for us to get a table, though the place was empty and there was no line (they seemed to be ignoring us almost). However once we sat down our waitress was lovely and the food delicious. We had a duck plate to share and the singapore noodles - two delicious dishes. And the wine was also good :)"
"This place is right in the casino, so if you are gambling, it's very convenient. There is a lot of variety and some great dishes and dim sum to boot!  The oxtail soup was great as was the char siu pork and others enjoyed the beef noodle dish and the pad thai noodle entree. Top that off with some hot tea and you are ready to go!  It's a bit pricy but if you like noodles and other Chinese staples, it's worth the time and $ to visit!"
"Being in the Bellagio, I expected much more.  The host and server were not very welcoming and although the portions were big, the noodle dishes we had were underwhelming & needed more sauciness/savoryness & flavor.  The only good thing is they messed up and only seemed to have charged the tip to our room.,We appreciate you writing a review of your recent experience at Noodles. We would like to apologize for the dissatisfaction with the customer service you received. It is very disheartening to hear we fell short of our goal in this instance and we have passed along your concerns to our management team for further review. I have sent you a private message and hope to further discuss this recent experience in detail. I look forward to hearing from you and hope to welcome you to Noodles in the near future."
"Came here on a friends recommendation, can only assume he had better service. Mediocre, lukewarm dim sum, very limited variety, expensive and SLOOOOOOOOW. Steam cart came by only 3 times in 75 minutes, and we were seated right on main aisle. Skip it, there are waaaay better places to eat.,Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your recent experience at Noodles. We would like to apologize for the dissatisfaction with the customer service you received. It is very discouraging to hear we fell short of our goal in this instance and we have passed along your concerns to our management team for further review. I have sent you a private message and hope to further discuss this recent experience in detail. I look forward to hearing from you and hope to welcome you to Noodles in the near future."
Phad Thai good...Asian spaghetti bad. The curry was nice but gentle. The wine selection could be better.
"Overall the food was excellent, but the price seems a little steep to comparable restaurants. I was quickly sat, but waited a while for the food. The appetizer and entree came out at the same time which was disappointing."
"Vegas priced, long line ups, bland over light atmosphere.
Not many midle range priced restaurants at the Bellagio. This one is just o.k. Service was slow, and methodical."
We enjoyed our meal.  There was no line but the place was full.  We sat at the counter which worked just fine for my husband and me.  Great service. The prices were a tad bit high but it was convenient. As we were leaving about 9pm the line was out the door!
"I found noodles by accident right after I checked into the Bellagio. The staff was very friendly, efficient and the place was beautiful. I highly recommend this if you are in the mood for casual Asian fare."
"I ate here twice while in Vegas. The staff is friendly, the food is good and reasonably priced. Some of my wedding guests ate here as well and enjoyed it. The staff were able to accommodate my gluten allergy.  Just beware that some of the soups have soy sauce added and soy sauce has gluten. I needed a easy and light lunch on my wedding day. Our waitress was so excited for me and went out of her way to make sure I had just the lunch I needed.  I would eat here again and again. The restaurant was also smoke free and quiet.  We also liked the little carts of dim sum the staff brought table to table."
"We ate here one evening and we could not have been more impressed.  The food was hot, fresh, delicious and the service was top notch. We will be eating here again. A hidden gem behind the Baccarat Bar"
"Good food, slow service even though not crowded. That's it! Not worth the convenience of being right in hotel.,Thank you for choosing Noodles as your recent dining experience. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed the delicious menu options but we would like to apologize for your dissatisfaction with the level of service you received. Our team is focused on serving our guests as quickly and efficiently as possible and we are sorry we fell short in this instance . Your concerns will be shared with our management team for further review. We hope to welcome you back in the near future."
Enjoyed a very tasty quick dinner at Noodles. My wife and I shared BBQ Ribs and Pork Rice after an appetizer of Pot Stickers. All was well prepared and in ample quantity.
"In a city where you pay a lot for food, it's very refreshing to find an excellent restaurant that offers great food at pretty reasonable price. Service was fast and food was absolutely delicious. Highly recommended."
"This was the second time my wife and I ate at Noodles (also March 2012).  The menu has quite a few selections so there is something to please everyone.  Its a causal restaurant so no need to dress up.  The only downside with both experiences was that the waitstaff aren't the best at speaking English and you can order the wrong thing.  And yes, it happened to me.  No big deal as it added to the authentic experience and gave a better feel for Asian culture.  We will return again next year."
We had the opportunity to try some dishes we would not ordinarily eat. Very pleasant dining experience.
"We wanted a convenient but nice meal in our hotel (Bellagio) before heading out to a 9PM show, so we decided to try Noodles.  We waited about 20 minutes in line for a table, which was reasonable considering it was around 7PM.  We had a group of 4, and were seated at a booth, which looks pretty, but the benches had no backs which can get uncomfortable after a lengthy meal.  Unfortunately, for me, this set the stage for a mediocre meal (though other members in my group really enjoyed it).

We had the pork potstickers/wontons for an appetizer, which were delicious and reasonably-priced ($9 for 5).  I ordered chicken Pad Thai, and based on the appetizer, had high hopes.  Unfortunately, I found some of the noodles undercooked and chewy, with many of them clumped together as if they had sat out for a while before being served to me.  The sauce was not very flavorful, and it was thick, almost making the noodles and chicken taste dry.  The portion was large, but there was only a tiny sprinkling of peanuts on top.  Additionally, there were no sprouts/onions/carrots or anything of color on the dish - just chicken and pasta, with a few scattered pieces of egg.  I was really disappointed in this basic dish.

Another member of my party had Kung Pao chicken (great flavor, with plenty of crunchy red/green peppers and without the cliche battered meat).  The others had dishes with shrimp and udon noodles (the shrimp were large and well-cooked and also flavorful.  So, the reviews were mixed on flavors within our group.

Another downside was the service.  We waited quite a while to have our water glasses refilled, which I consider a basic service all restaurants should be efficient at.  Additionally, the dishes were not brought out together for the entire table, they were brought as they were made in the kitchen - I got my food, my husband got his 3-5 minutes later, and the other couple we were with got their plates another 5 minutes later.  This made it difficult for us to eat together while our food stayed warm.  Finally, when we asked for the check so that we could get to our show on time, there was a lengthy wait for the server to bring it to our table.

Again, the reviews from our group were mixed (everyone seemed to love the food except for me).  But we did all agree that the serve was lacking.  I expected more from a restaurant that stands within the walls of the Bellagio."
"We went to a late night dinner @ Noodles on Valentine's Day....it is an absolute delight.  Great atmosphere, food & staff.  We enjoyed  unique shrimp ball  as well as delightful    kalamari appetizer's, our main courses were of course some of their famous noodles, 1 with extra lump crab...unbelievablely yummy.  The wait staff will guide you and everything is perfectly arranged to the eye as well as the pallet....a must stop when in Vegas....we will go back!"
"This is an eclectic Asian noodle restaurant located at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.  Walls and other areas are decorated with jars of noodles from rice to buckwheat and all kinds in between - just waiting to be cooked, I guess.  Dishes include Vietnamese Pho, Japanese Udon, Thai curried noodles and Chinese varieties.  Other unique Asian dishes are on the menu also.  Families can sit at large tables and singles (which I was on this trip) can sit at the bar."
"Super food, the dis sum selection is small but very good, try the crab fried rice it's exceptional, other dishes from the menu was also very good"
"The service was thoughtful, if not a touch slow, but polite.  My daughter loved her bowl of noodles, but mine was just okay.  A bit pricey.
Would eat here, again, if in a pinch.  When we saw the line to the buffet nearby, we were so hungry, we ate here at Noodles, instead.  A very nice atmosphere."
"Distastful  food, tempura one of the worst, also nasty pad thai with 2 small shrimp and old tasting maybe even spoiled rubbery chicken. All together ABSOLUTELY not worth the money. Really one of the worst eats in LV for sure.
Took prilosec and peptobismol to get rid of this dining experience!"
"Good quality food,  not pricey, good service.  It was centrally located in hotel. No dislikes. Would eat there again if at hotel.,Thank you for choosing Noodles as your dining experience. Our staff will be thrilled they could assist you in making your experience enjoyable while savoring our dishes. We look forward to welcoming you to Noodles on your next trip to Vegas."
"For Asians wanting comfort food, this place has a great selection of familiar Asian dishes.  All are prepared well so you won't be disappointed.  However, the line can be somewhat unbearable as the place isn't large enough to have a quick turnover.  Although they technically don't take reservations, you can call ahead for a large party.  Also, the service, although quick, is not particularly friendly but you weren't expecting authentic tasting food to come with good service anyway, right?"
"Tucked away along a small corridor in the casino Noodles restaurant served delicious food by gracious servers. I didn't quite understand the decor (one side felt like a beautifully lit open kitchen pantry while the other side suggested an african themed wall). Regardless - its a great place with a fairly reasonable price. Saw quite a few business travellers there, although we were there for fun."
"The soy sauce rice noodles were fresh and not oily at all, and the bamboo steamed veggies were cooked to perfection. Great meal!"
A little expensive for a Noodle restaurant but a great late night dining spot to soak up the alcohol! Be ready to wait there is always a line although it goes very fast.
We love Asian so we decided to give this place a try.  My wife ordered a chicken dish which was wonderful.  I ordered duck as I love the duck dishes at our local Thai food restaurant in Vermont.  This was horrible!  It was tough and bony and had little taste.  The leftover parts of bone and tough skin exceeded the edible portion.  We will not return as there are many other asian places in Vegas that are much better.
"This restaurant has become a tradition when I visit Vegas, and it has never failed to provide a great dining experience. Located inside the Bellagio , this small restaurant always has the best service and food. Our group was promptly seated and enjoyed freshly cooked appetizers. The waiter suggested spicy noodles and I really enjoyed the well prepared noodles. The food was excellent and everyone enjoyed their entrees. The servers were knowledgeable and courteous and no one had an empty glass or plate. As always, a great meal and looking forward to the next visit."
Loved the variety in the menu but the drinks were a bit overpriced even at dining room levels.  Waiters were prompt and we were moved when a group of loud and intoxicated gentlemen intruded on the ambience.  Would return.
We decided to eat here for our 'post' wedding celebration.  The staff was very nice along with our server who was friendly and attentive.  Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal and I especially liked the hot jasmine tea and spring rolls.  I recommend stopping by Noodles if you are in the mood for fresh authentic Asian cuisine.
"Let me start with the positives as I generally tend to view the world as half full.  The place had great promise as we stood in line and waited.  The decor was very original with straw sculptures hung on the walls and a full wall decked with canisters of noodles and the like.  The lighting was muted and glowing and created a elegant feel.  The music was muted and understated and the dim sum trolleys all added to a great sense of expectation.  And to be fair the appetizers were OK.  We ordered some dimsum, tempura and spring rolls. However the main course was a HUGE let down.  The  food was dull, uninspired, insipid and lifeless in terms of flavor. For the prices charged, we left feeling that the place was a complete rip off.  If you are looking for Asian food in a similar setting try Chin Chin at New York New York for some super authentic food that makes my mouth water even four days after!"
"I visited this restaurant over 10 years ago, it was excellent back then and again just recently went
back and the food quality is excellent again, great to see their consistent in this area. My only comment would be to do some upgrades in decor as this has not changed and it would be great to see a fresh transformation of this restaurant.,We are delighted you shared your experience with us and are thrilled to know you relished the food quality. We will be happy to pass your suggestions along to our management team for future consideration. We hope you choose to dine with us in the near future."
"I love this place. Great dim sum and excellant noodle dishes. Tucked in the corner of the Bellagio Casino floor next to the baccarat. I had not been here in 5 years yet the food was still perfect. Service is no nonsense fast, not a place to chit chat with the waiter. I had three different types of dim sum and a mixed seafood noodle dish. This place reminded me of a casino restaurant in Macau. Every time I'm in Vegas I have to eat here at least once.,We are excited you choose Noodles as your dining selection every time you visit Las Vegas. Our staff will be ecstatic to know they reached their goal in assisting you fast and efficiently. We are happy you loved the different array of noodle dishes and look forward to your next visit in the near future."
"This is a great little spot just inside the casino on the front desk side. Nice selection of noodle dishes, appetizer plates, and wide-ranging Asian entrees. I always default to the noodle dishes, particularly pork or duck. Portion size is large, and very reasonable for inside casino dining. As others have noted, it is off in the corner which offers a nice place to get away for the Vegas chaos.  Enjoy!,Thank you for sharing your enjoyable dining experience at Noodles with us. We are thrilled you enjoyed the wide range selections within our menu the savoring noodle dishes. Our secluded restaurant location is a nice getaway just off the casino floor. We hope you choose to dine with us in the near future."
"After half an hour of reading Yelp reviews and deliberating over whether we wanted to pay higher than LA prices for Asian cuisine , we sucked it up and decided to give Noodles a try.  

Decor and ambience: not at all pretentious.  Moderate Asian influence, minimalist decor, and comfortable atmosphere.  Seating is away from the gaming floor so you forget you are at a casino.

Food: had the sweet and spicy noodle and Mandarin beef stew.  Flavors were good and meat was flavorful and tender.  The place is known for its wonton soup, but we were not in the mood for it this evening.  Looking around at other tables, classic dishes like the fried rices and BBQ pork looked excellent.  The menu is a fusion of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese flavors / dishes.

Service: excellent - we arrived hungry and ready to over order.  To our surprise, and in an environment where we expect to be upsold, our waiter was extremely helpful in deciding how much to order and flat said No when I wanted to get a third dish, Lol.  This was a huge service because being on vacation, I would have had no where to keep the leftovers.  All staff were courteous and very accommodating as well.

Portion size is relative.  Contrary to many of the reviews in Yelp, we found the portions to be adequate.  Granted I don't eat like I used to in college, but two entrees are enough for two average sized bellies to leave feeling slightly uncomfortably full."
"This is a nice Asian themed place, if you are looking to take a break from the casino and have a nice snack, drink or meal. 

My wife and I were there this month and had dinner and drinks. Very friendly staff and the food was delicious!  

The prices were reasonable, we felt, and we would return on our next trip."
Tired and hungry and you want some decent food without the fuss.  Try the Singapore noodles at Noodles Bellagio.  They were delicious and the staff were very accommodating. It also has an authentic atmosphere.
"We went to the Bellagio to take some pictures of the hotel during Chinese New Year and we found this restaurant (we both love this cuisine). We decided to try it. It was very busy but they seated us right away. After reviewing the menu, we knew we made the right choice. My wife had Chicken Satay with peanut sauce (4 skewers of tender chicken) and I had the Pork Dumplings (5) for appetizers. We split the Chicken Pad Thai and were glad we did. Everything was fantastic! We both raved to family, it was the best meal we had in Vegas."
"Noddles from all over Asia. This restaurant is not a fancy one; however, there is always a crowd waiting in line to get in. Dumplings are delicious here. Congee with Abalone is really good. Noodles will not break your budget, and at the same time, it will satisfy your palate."
"It goes without saying that the strip is expensive when it comes to food and I do expect to pay a premium. But even Noodles couldn't convince me that I was getting any value for the dollar. My wife humored me by agreeing to come here for lunch. For our meals, we had 8 pork shu mai dumplings (4 dumpling per order), a bowl of wonton soup, a cucumber salad, crab fried rice, and 2 sodas. This came to with tip close to $80 dollars. The dumplings were good, the wonton soup was bland, the cucumber salad was ok, and the crab fried rice was a bit bland as well. The food wasn't bad overall, but the value was not there."
"I loved my noodle dish, I forgot the name, the decor was very hip, the service was great, my only problem was the cost...a little pricey."
"This was a very good restaurant--and in fact, it was the best restaurant I tried at the Bellagio.  The noodle bowl I had was absolutely delicious--as good as any I've had in San Francisco, which is known for its great Japanese and Asian fare in general.  I ordered the spicy Thai bowl with shrimp and it was fabulous!  The service was also very quick--you can get in and out very quickly for lunch.  It was also reasonably priced--which is another plus since most of the Bellagio restaurants are quite expensive."
Fresh and tasty. Reasonable prices and excellent staff in this small restaurant. Enjoyed so much we went twice!
"Dim Sum offers great selection of baked, steamed, or fried items. Located in Bellagio, rather hidden behind the Baccarat Bar.  Less noisy than the other lunch options in the Hotel.  Service was ok...not the high end service so much of Bellagio offers.  But the food is what brought us to Noodles!"
"In Vegas, we all tend to indulge in some gambling and booze.  Sometimes the atmosphere in Vegas makes us forget about eating.  Noodles in the Bellagio is the perfect place to refuel.  A bit pricey, but it is Vegas.  Hard to find real Japanese Noodles in my home town, so this was a great treat.  Plus a nice heavy meal to absorb some of the excess was well needed."
"As most everything in the Bellagio it was a bit expensive.  That being said,, the portions were large and an appetizer is not needed.  Not knowing what to expect from Pad Thai I can't exactly judge whether or not it is truly authentic Pad Thai but I can say my dish was huge and very tasty.  In the Bellagio you should be very pleased to get a meal for two under $50 and be full afterward."
"We've been to Noodles a few times.  What we call ""Shrimp Balls"" are actually called Shiu Mai.  The first time they were incredibly delicious.  The second time there were good just for whatever reason not as good.  Don't know why, but will still go back."
we were a party of 7 and we were seated pretty quickly. i wasn't feeling too well but i ordered potstickers that were super yummy! service was quick and the restaurant has a nice cool vibe to it.
Basic chinese fare. Not bad but nothing special. Not a bad place to grab a quick lunch but don't expect much.
"All of our meals were really good. No reservations, but if you go early you can get in easily.  It was relatively inexpensive.  Not really a romantic place, but great for a fairly informal meal.  Will definitely go back."
"We went here one night for dinner for a change of pace.  The food was amazing.  Asian flare with so much flavor.  We each ordered a noodle dish, we could have shared one.  
Service was great, and it didn't take long at all to get our food.  Prices very reasonable for being inside the Bellagio."
"Small restaurant but decent good food.  Try the various appetizers (Malaysian Roti, Gyoza, Tempura and the usual spring rolls)."
"The service was absolutely pitiful! Slow, and gave three of us our meals at three different times, at least 20 mins in between each!"
"Tucked away in the corner of the Bellagio is like Oriental restaurant. The entrance is a little narrow (particularly with a queue, which there often seemed to be) but inside is quite spacious and modestly designed with nothing pretentious about it but still looking nice. The one exception to this was the experience of eating at the bar rather than waiting for a table; the bar seats are separated from the kitchen by a solid wooden partition that goes up above head height and is a plate width from the edge, essentially meaning that you are facing a wall for your meal, which is an odd piece of design.

The food is good though – not amazing perhaps but certainly of a high standard and it was reasonably priced considering its location, the menu has a good range to chose from and everything looked good and my orders were fresh and filling. Service is efficient and polite without having much character and generally it was a really nice place that is reasonably priced for its location (which also contributes to the queues I guess) but I wouldn’t advise sitting at the bar unless it really cuts a lot of time off your wait."
"Big portions of tastefull food mainly noodles with beef, pork, chicken. You may easily share it for two persons"
"Noodles is what I call a ""canteen"" vs. ""upscale restaurant"".  Although its prices are much higher than what I dubb ""canteens"" it is well worth it.  It is is Vegas and at the Bellagio so expect higher prices.  But the food quality and taste is simple the best of all canteens.  Since I am first a foodie I would say I'd rather eat at Noodles that most upscale Chinese restaurants.  In many ways I feel so lucky...as I ""used to"" play a lot of poker at the Bellagio (before getting married and had taken 2 years off of a regular job to hang-out, including playing lots of poker) and so needed an ""everyday"" place to eat and Noodles was so good I could eat there everyday (and did for the most part).  Love everything there, but especially the Chow Mein, Mandarin Beef Soup Noodles, BBQ and Chicken Curry."
"Since we've been traveling for 2 weeks away from my beloved Philippines, I missed Asian food. Dining here satisfied my hunger for rice and wonton noodles.  Had my usual BBQ pork with rice."
My husband waited in line for 15 min (not bad). It was our first meal at the Bellagio and it was delicious. We had the spring rolls and sweet and spice chicken noodles. We thoroughly enjoyed both sitting at the bar. Our server Susan was very warm and accommodating. We took her suggestion on the dessert and it was fabulous - congee with mango. We will go back before we leave because it was great and reasonable. (We shared - which helped with the price.)
"since we were seated immediately on new years eve should have been our first clue that the food would not be great. The services was fine and the food was just ok! nothing was horrible but not great either. (kind of like mall chinese food)  was surprised at the check price after ordering chicken chow mein ,lettuce wraps, and two glasses of wine. i wouldnt go back, there are too many options in vegas that i would not return unless it was very good. if you reserve a table the atmosphere is probably better, since we walked in we were basically sitting on the same bench as another couple so you can hear eachothers conversations, not very romatic"
"There was a 45 minute wait to get in, but that's not too bad. I took it as a good sign that most of the people in line were Asian. The food was good and the service was fine, but nothing really stood out at all for me here."
Ate here our first night at the Bellagio.  It was outstanding the service was as well.  We ordered too much food but couldn't help it.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious.  There was a line to get in always but it moves fairly quickly.  It's worth the wait.
"Fresh Pasta, fairly subtle Pad Thai and Sweet and Spicy sauce. Very good Sesame Balls (they are small but fresh) and Tempura Vegetables were okay. It's a small restaurant, so if the line is long consider the wait. Two entrees will put you over $50 fairly easily, but everything at Bellagio seems even more expensive. No bathrooms in the restaurant, you have to walk across the casino next to the Jasmine or up next to the Buffet, so do that first. Me and my wife were there in 2010 and now in 2012, and both times were satisfied."
"Great Option for great Chinese food. They have the BEST wonton soup anywhere! A bit pricey, but worth it :)"
"My favorite open-24-hours Vegas dining. The service is top notch, as are the noodle bowls. The Wonton Noodle dish is solo succulent, with great shrimp flavor. I also love the Japanese Seafood Udon bowl, with a great panoply of flavors and textures. And they have a nice selection of large size Japanese beers."
Went first time in taxi...learned they delivered within 2 miles. Had awesome meal for $6.95. I would strongly recommend on a hangover!
"Ate here while staying at the Bellagio.  Food was okay, really really bland.  However, great prices when comparing it to the other restaurants at the casino."
Had a remarkable lunch at Noodles in the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. While the prices are a bit steep the quality of the food is excellent. Had the best string beans in XO sauce I've had. Not a bit salty like at so many other places. Service is attentive and courteous. Worth a visit when in Vegas.
"Middle of the road. Food wasn't bad...just there. Seemed a bit overpriced, even for Vegas, for what it was. That said, waitstaff was very nice and attentive, service was fast, and it was a decent experience."
We loved the mai tais and the homemade wonton soup.  Great location (right off the casino in the Bellagio).  Really authentic dim sum and the oyster sauce is delicious!
"quick service, good quality food, decent service, particularly good dim sum

small queue compared to other restaurants on site"
"Great dim sum on carts, all sorts of interesting soup and noodle dishes -- good to go with a few people so you can sample lots of dishes."
"Looking at the menu outside the restaurant, the prices and queue of people waiting for table (but mind you it was Saturday night) I thought this must be great noodle place. I had dumplings which were usual good but nothing exceptional. I opted for some steamed vegetables which were lacking some kind of condiment at 18$, next was Tom yam Soup which is one of my favourite soups ever but this one was really dissapointing, again at 18$ for a soup. No kick to it at all. With bottle of water my take out (I didn't eat in) was 56 $...just for me. I wouldn't mind paying this price if food was outstanding or at least good, but it wasn't. Maybe other dishes are better and I didn't have luck with my choice. I would have been better with buffet at Bellagio that evening!"
"The staff were quick, friendly and attentive. The food was very tasty and there was plenty of it; and the price was very reasonable. 

If you want to stay at the Bellagio for the evening but not spend a fortune this place is perfect."
"needed something light after a long flight to LV, and being late at night this was perfect. Food was great."
"After being married in Vegas & staying at the Bellagio, my wife & I return to Vegas (& Noodles) annually and always enjoy the food. It's so good that we overlook the seemingly miserable staff. Any questions about menu items are met with hasty & mean replies that make you feel stupid. All the diners around us were addressing the same issue; our waitress was plain nasty. Also, there are no free refills on the $4+ soda. Maybe it's cultural, but despite that, it's always very busy, with a line out the door.  Like others have said, go for the food... only."
"Room at the noodles was good, especially dim sums. The service average at its best - the staff seemed very unhappy."
"needed something light after a long flight to LV, and being late at night this was perfect. Food was great."
"So sat there thinking every casino needs am Asian spot to attract the addicted gamblers from the mother land. This was bellagios. And overall I liked the food just not the price. 

Beef noodle soup a tad on the mild side but good
Thousand year egg and pork congee was very good 
Calamari was pretty yummy too. 
This and side of booked Broccali was over 60."
"I love Noodles!  They have outstanding food, especially if you know what to order.  The place has not great atmosphere - in fact, some would call it poor, but the food is awesome, and you get a lot.  The service is always iffy, but you are not there for the service.

Here's what I do: After a day of gaming or whatever, including dinner, at about 11pm. I want a little something to take to the room at the Bellagio.  I swing by Noodles for some War Wonton or shrimp or some chow mein and get it to go.  I take it back to the room, turn on the TV and chow down.   Always terrific.  If you eat there, it's fine too, but the service is real hit and miss."
The food had lots of oil in it and was nothing out of the ordinary.  The food was also luke warm.  Would not eat here again.
"Yummo, we popped in for Yum Cha on a Saturday morning and enjoyed every mouth full. Great to have this retreat in the middle of Vegas. Busy with quick serve, delicious snacks. A great find"
"There is always a line at Noodles, but the wait is worth it.  Dim sum is fabulous as well as the crispy duck, the seafood fried rice, and chow mein.  Prices are reasonble considering it is at the Bellagio.  I keep returning to Noodles for the amazing food."
"Go for the dim sum, not a huge selection but all very good.  Service is fast and the prices cheap for the Bellagio.  Very busy at lunch and fairly loud."
"Our meal was really good but I forgot to ask what kind of broth was used in the noodle soup and it was a fish broth.  Since I don't like fish broth I wasn't a fan of my soup but the spring rolls, Mongolian beef & rice were excellent.  With more inquiry I would have had a completely fantastic meal."
"I found this place in one of my stays, and I keep coming back. It's a small place inside Bellagio, with modern decor and great food."
"While the service was ok, the food was really yummy. I have had better pad tai at my own local restaurant, but the spicy noodles were amazing! We went right after seeing O, and pretty much bolted out of the theatre to get to Noodles before the rush, and I'm glad we did because other wise it would have been quite a wait."
"The dim sum and entrees are fantastic but the service was a not great, the servers were unattentive and seemed stressed. but if you can put up with that the food is good"
We had a group of 7 and were looking for a good dinner before going out for the night and found it here. The noodle dishes were delicious and we even had the leftovers the next day and were still very good. I had a noodle dish with shrimp and was fantastic. would definitely go there again next time in town.
Food fab but service was marred by miserable staff who threw menu and food at you as if it was an effort to be there - also expected a tip and banged on the table in disgust when she didn't get one - we always tip especially for good service!
"Neat atmosphere, with many different asian style dishes offered.  Dishes seemed to lack any distinguishing flavors, almost bland.  Overpriced considering the quality of the food.  Service OK."
Crab fried rice and soy noodles with shrimp---yum! Plenty for 2. Fast service. Good prices. Highly recommend this place.
"Visited twice love it here for casual eating
Yum yum
Try the sweet and spicy chicken thin noodles
Serves lovely fee ice water so don't buy drinks"
"We ordered takeout from Noodles one evening and were not disappointed.  We ordered the crispy calamari with chili sauce (sauce was very spicy) and chicken pad Thai.  I really liked the pad Thai although it did not taste like traditional pad Thai that I have had in the past (not much of a peanut or thai influenced taste). It was good though.  When I went to pick it up, there was a line of people waiting to be seated so I was glad we got ours to-go. The food was ready within 10 minutes of ordering.  Great place for Asian cuisine in a casual environment.  Portions were large and prices were great for Vegas."
"the food was great, the location as well...prices are reasonable.. I recommend this restaurant for lunch."
"If you're into Asian fusion you will love this place... The decor is nothing special (think of your standard sushi joint) the food definitely made up for it though... We shared a couple of things from the menu, but everything looked great!! Would def recommend the pork buns!!!"
"We ate here as a family of 4 late on our second night in vegas primarily as it stays open until 2 am ish.  We had a good table, friendly service and great food.  Planned to come back and eat after seeing ""O"" in the bellagio theatre later in week.

Visit 2 - what a difference a week makes, we queued after seeing ""O"" but had enjoyed the food so was worth the 20 min wait we thought, however warning signs were empty uncleared tables in view for the whole wait even with a queue.  Our server Pauline was not the friendliest and tried to fill my glass with water while i was drinking it, despite being told a refill wasn't necessary, food came after a long wait but one meal was missing, asked repeatedly if it was coming as we all wanted to wait together and kept getting assured few minutes, this wasn't a complicated order and the restaurant wasn't full.  Eventually I asked Pauline again on the wait and told her it was unacceptable to wait this long for the final meal, that we were half way through ours and very dissapointed with our second visit, this was all said very politely as is the british way without raised voice or swearing. Her response I'M NOT THE ONE TO ARGUE WITH I'LL GET THE MANAGER! ""  well i wasn't arguing but fine speaking to the manager works for me, a few minutes later she came out and asked what the problem was, explained again that the wait was unacceptable and we had wanted to eat as a family, at this stage an apology and assurance that the meal was on its way would have been suffice but her response was ""what do you want me to do about it ! ""  erm your'e the manager I want you to sort out the meal and train your team to deal with basic enquiries.  However i replied I'd like the 4th meal as soon as possible and for it to be removed from the bill.  She walked away and didn't come back. When we got the bill it had been removed and suddenly as it was tip time pauline started making polite small talk.  The food was just as good the second time but we will never go back there and wouldn't feel right recommending it unless you get a pre ordered takeaway."
In previous reviews the reviewer mentioned the unattentive service they got.  Well guess what that must be their mode of operation. Because our experience with some of their wait staff was exactly like that.  It was by far our worst dining experience in our Las Vegas stay.  The noodles were passable but nothing to rave about.  We will take them off of our list of restaurants in Vegas that we must go back to.  I hope they wake up soon on how to treat customers because if they don't then they may not have worry about haing any customers.  Being a lover of all kinds of Noodles this is a bust for me!.
"The food is edible but if you want to eat Americanized Asian food, PF Chang has better tasting food for a better price and is a 5 minute walk across the street. Potstickers were hard little balls of meat inside thick, chewy wrappers, fried rice was ok but didn't have the proper stickiness of authentic fried rice and none of the ""umami"" flavour that separates the good from the great. Also, we were seated in the back and no one came to take our order for 20 minutes, and then they forgot our beers when the food came. It could be a great place to eat... but it's not."
"I was visiting the Bellagio Casino and I found this restaurant there. I tried the shrimp dumplings and the Sea Food Udon Soup.

The menu offer a variety of options and the service is just excellent.

Great atmosphere and decoration."
"Tucked away off the casino floor in Bellagio, we were pleasently surprised by the variety on the menu. The vegetables tasted as if they had just come from the Farmer's Market. We started with spring rolls, shared a shrimp dish as well as pad thai with chicken. We ordered boch choy with garlic and that was probably the best boch choy that we have ever had. Go!"
"we had the dim sum and chicken noodles, the restaurant was so busy as all of the restaurants are but it was worth the 30 minute wait!"
"We were walking the strip all day and just felt like Chinese food, every thing was very good we came at 10 pm seated right away, service was great food was great not the best but very good"
"Having an especially select pallet for Asian food I only eat in the best, and this place fits the bill.

Reservation accepted, seated immediately, two course dinner, amazing food, awesome service, value for money.

Peaceful setting and full of fellow business diners. Plenty of room to set up your iPad or Laptop along with your Blackberry to work while you dine.

Can't recommend enough. See you next year!"
"The best Dim Sum in town - served only on weekends, it is worth the wait. Most of the customers you see are Asian, which should serve as testimony to the food there!"
"We enjoyed our meals here, especially the dim sum, and spring rolls appys.  I thought the Chinese fried rice was very good also,
The service definitely could've been a little better and while I certainely understood the ""corked"" glass of wine they brought me is one of those things that just happens, I did not appreciate the waiter telling me I just wasn't use to Sauv Blanc, as if he knew how much wine knowledge I have.  If the glass is bad, take it away and bring another, don't tell customer they don't know wine."
"after spending money and gambling in the exciting city of vegas all we wanted is to relax and dine with chinese food!! entered into this noodle restaurant, as we stayed in bellagio, we were impressed by the service first of all!!! the atmosphere is simple and beautiful with a touch of modernicity . the food was excellent, really authentic chinese dining and we left truly satisfied!!! i guess bellagio cannot go wrong with the choices in dining ... and that was the first but not the least.... well done noodles!!!"
We loved the food n the service..thr were a lof of veg options too..n the best thing is tht it is open till late!
"Very busy restaurant.  Good service, food was great and staff explained the menu very well.  Would deffinately visit again."
"We ate here on our last day in Vegas while staying at the Bellagio. If you're craving Chinese dim sum, this place is pretty good for that. They also have a wide selection of noodles. We had the won ton soup and it was very flavorful with very tasty won tons!"
"I had dinner here a few nights ago , and once i ordered my dishes i was asked if i would be charging it to my room, i said no but would be using my comp on my m life card. The server asked for my card and disappeared,   I really did not think anything about it  just figured it was to speed up the bill at the end, but to my surprise he came back 5 mins later and stated the cashier was away and he could not put in my order till they confirmed my balance,    This took me a minute to understand that we was checking on my card,  so the question i asked was "" if i was paying cash would you ask to see it first,  if it was credit would you run my credit card first "" .   It was all fine and after my rather loud reply to his dilemma, he proceeded to get my order .  and yes i had more than enough to cover this meal and many more on the card ,   The food was good but left a really bad taste in my mouth ,"
"Very long line for seating but was worth the wait.Nice selection, creative plateing, very busy servers (could use a few more) Enjoyed very much."
"Great little restaurant that we tried just as we arrived. Excellent food and very nice staff.
The noodles were lovely and soft and the green tea was excellent."
This was a great place for dinner easy fast & very affordable highly recommend. We ate here several lunches & dinners and the service each time was very effecient and courteous staff
"My business partner and I enjoyed Noodles.  Had a good variety of chinese, thai, vietnamese food.  I had the shu mai.  Came out a bit soggy as if it had been sitting under the heat lamps, but the flavor and consistency was excellent.  Went on to the main dish with seafood soup.  Filled with delicious shrimp, calamari, and fish, in a very flavorful broth.

My partner had the fried calamari...........better than I have had in many Italian restaurants.  And, the pad thai.  A bit boring for my taste, but he seemed to like it.  

Good atmosphere, although with tables very close together.........much like a New York resaurant.  Service was very good."
Yes there will be a line and yes you will wait but it is worth it.  2 people did  Pad Thai and steamed vegtables and still had food left to take home.  Great value in terms of price for Vegas.
"Just a small little restaurant, but the food is great.  I never know what to order when I get here but I am never disappointed.  It's a great lunch spot."
"This place is fine if you don't normally eat a lot of different types of Asian food. It isn't terrible and the quality is fine but if you eat Asian food reguarly, you will know the difference. 

We ordered the Oriental Fried Rice and the Pad Thai and they both were lacking in flavor. Very generous portions though. Also- their Pad Thai isn't Pad Thai... I've had Pad Thai at tons of restaurants and it always uses the same type noodles and has the same tasting sauce. Their version of Pad Thai used thicker noodles and their sauce was bland and not spicy. It just tasted like some sort of Chinese noodle dish... No Thai tastes whatsoever. Both of these dishes were $17+... I didn't think either were worthy of that price tag.

The atmosphere and decor were very nice but the Red 8 at the Wynn is much better if you're looking for great Asian food on the strip!"
"We ordered lunch there, and nothing was under $18.  When all you get is a mound of rice, some sliced duck and bok choy I don't know how they can give you the bill without blushing.  It was delicious though."
"Been here once while I was in business trip to Vegas . The food was good ,service was ok, atmosphere was nice and staff were friendly. I would love to visit again"
"If you want a really great meal, don't overlook Noodles.  The food is exceptional and the menu is extensive.  It's located in the hotel for convenience.  My husband had the Singapore style noodles and Shu Mai and I had the Shu Mai, Miso Soup and Tempura Shrimp - all outstanding.  You will not be disappointed if you decide to eat at Noodles."
"My husband and I had a very nice dinner here. The food, though it took a while to cook, was fresh and quite tasty. It seems most major hotel restaurants take a longer time to prepare the food but that's due to the volume, I'm sure."
Love Noodles - my favorite non expensive restaurant at Bellagio.
Great noodle shop at the Bellagio.  We always go there first thing after we arrive in Vegas.  Dim Sum is great.  I love the Calamari.  Usually a short wait in line.
"The food is very below average, not authentic Chinese at all! Overpriced for the food quality, should not be in the Bellagio, belongs in a food court. The restaurant is clean and service is good, but needs improvement with the food, there is a large selection. We ordered the dim sum, they were so small and average, the egg rolls were greasy, and the phad Thai was too sweet, too much sugar."
"I have eaten here several times, and on a recent family trip five of us all had a very good lunch, especially the delicious wonton soup. Service here is sometimes a bit slow and it isn't particularly friendly, but the noodles are absolutely delicious."
excellent noodles !  Asian fusion cuisine at its best.
"Noodles was oriental cusine at its finest.  The prices were reasonable and they encourage sharing.  We had spare ribs, shrimp lo mein, wonton soup, spring rolls and a stir fry dish.  There was plenty to share so we really had a feast for about $30.00 per person.  Get there early as the resturant fills up quickly and the line to get a table can get quite long."
Great place to get away from casino noise. the food is above average with excellent service.
"Had a nice dinner here before going to see ""O"". Lots of menu options and various prices. Food was fresh and tasty and not at all greasy for Asian food. The Singapore noodles and duck noodle soup were great."
"This place makes pretty good noodle soup, especially the cantonese and the beef stew ones. The fried noodle dishes, especially the chow mein ones, are not as good. There's always a line and the restaurant is close to a bar and gets plenty of cigarette smoke going through the door. If you stay at the Bellagio, you can order it through room service to avoid line and smoke."
"Overall it was a nice meal, we were told the wait time was half an hour and the front girl was working around the clock to get people in. Staff is a bit pushy, but the overall meal and atmosphere was ok. Nothing special but fine enough."
Great food-high quality- would always recommend- will be visiting again for another experience.
We had a wonderful lunch with a wonderful waitress that made this a great lunch and the service was wonderful
"Perfect for a quick asian fix - all the dishes we ordered were fresh and delicious including pan fried pork dumplings, hot & spicy cucumber salad, hainanese chicken rice & cantonese roast duck. Also highly recommend the zombie drink to share!"
"The fare is largely that of a noodle shop.  But the decor, setting, service, and the remaining elements of the package serve to elevate that experience to a new level.  It is a fun place to go, a beehive of activity, good food, and a nice variety on the menu.  Altogether a fun place to go when I want to have a relaxed lunch with a friend."
"Although the line to get in was a little long, we enjoyed our meal here very much.  It was outstanding food and plenty of it.  The service was quick and friendly.  Cost is reasonable for the amount of food and the taste.  Restaurant is very clean."
"Perfect for a quick asian fix - all the dishes we ordered were fresh and delicious including pan fried pork dumplings, hot & spicy cucumber salad, hainanese chicken rice & cantonese roast duck. Also highly recommend the zombie drink to share!"
"We had a pretty tight schedule and needed to find a quick place for a light meal. As we were staying at Bellagio, Noodles seemed to fit the bill. It was fairly busy, but we were seated right away. The restaurant was clean and inviting. This is pretty much where my compliments end. The couple next to us were eating their entrees and it looked really good. We asked them what they had ordered. They told us that the food was not good and recommended that we stay away from the seafood. They ended up leaving most of their food, paid and left. We should have followed suit, but we didn't have much time, so we placed our order anyway. We ordered two entrees, a curried noodle and a noodle soup. The food presentation was basically a zero, food flung on a plate. But hey, if the taste is good, it's all good right? Well no. The food was uninspired and bland. I have no problem in spending extra money to eat in a hotel restaurant. What I do object to is spending almost $20 per entree and receiving something that would be better suited served in a carry out box from an over the counter order restaurant. We told the server that our meals were not good, he just shrugged and offered to bring some extra broccoli. They obviously spent more on the decor of the restaurant rather than the menu and cooking techniques. I would not recommend this restaurant."
"i went to this restaurant very often, and always the line waiting. If u have to go, go before 7 pm... After 7, always line.... very good and clean"
"The food options, service and atmosphere are high quality for a casual/business meal experience. All Asian staff most likely."
"First off- we kept ourselves occupied during the 25 mins table wait by watching the staff at Noodle. It was like a comedy sketch- there were clearly empty tables in need of bussing but the few staff on the floor seemed to be keeping themselves really busy doing...well not much at all. The hostess kept walking back and forth to the booth, straightening up her menus and doing her best not to make any eye contact with the growing line outside (you win, hostess...). the person i presumed was the manager kept hiding in the back. But my favourite was the waitress who moved to clear tables at the rate of a tortoise- and im not exxagerating here- it was a talent being that slow- the line was starting to notice how she clearly didn't care that there were people waiting to be seated. That's the point: clearly the staff don't care. 

We managed to get seated by asking to sit at a table that had been ready to go for about 10 minutes. After waiting another 5, we ""asked"" for some menus by waving down the absent hostess. 

Our orders were taken- and the waiter did well as my friend asked for a complicated order- but we noticed that our waiter had still not put our order through 10 minutes. At this point, we realised the people who entered about 15 minutes before us had recieved their main, but were still waiting for rice... My friend and I looked ay each other and decided that we should have actually left Noodle an hour ago. 

Flagging down our waiter again and telling him that we were leaving, my jaw literally dropped to the floor when the waiter rolled his eyes and walked away from us (hey, at least we proven he cared about something). He then turned back to us and shouted ""the food is being cooked""- clearly a lie as he hadn't moved anywhere near an area to put an order in. My friend and I walked out actually laughing because the whole situation seemed surreal. Avoid if you're looking for actual service!"
The food was very good and it's very convenient if you're staying at the Bellagio
We had been wanting to try Noodles for quite some time so when we went to Vegas in May we decided that this was going to be the time to go and we were so disappointed. I didnt mind the 15 minute wait but what you get for the price as well as the overall flavor was just not what i expected. I had the BBQ Pork rice which left much to be desired and my wife had the chicken fried rice which was a little on the mushy side to say the least. Service was almost nonexistent and i was able to get a efill on my drink before i was ready to get out of there.
"When you eat asian food in asia its different, but slop is slop,
The food here was not satisfactory, it was raw to overcooked (chicken) sloppy service and presentation, and flavors were not jiving, I am south asian, and have been eveywhere and eaten everywhere including china and this was not good food."
"Great food but, sometimes the line is long and no reservations."
"Noodles at Bellagio is an excellent option for dinner. 
- No reservations needed (after 11pm the wait may take 15-20 minutes), 
- open until 2am (maybe the only place in Bellagio that serves food after 10pm), 
- the food was great (recommended: dumplings, duck noodle soup, japanese seafood soup)
- the service was excellent (and fast)
- prices were great, especially compared to overpriced restaurants in Las Vegas
- the ambiance could be better. Although the decoration is nice, the light is too bright and reminds of a diner more than a restaurant. I wish they dimmed the lights and put a candle on each table.

Overall experience - great. We ate there twice and would go again."
Although small this restaurant inside the Bellagio offers excellent Japanese and chinesse cuisines especially noodles of all sorts .appetizers are small but excellent.Expect a long wait for entrance and no reservations are required.
"Had a couple of great meals in this cute noodle joint.  The fresh squeezed watermelon, carrot & orange juices were wonderful!

Prices were pretty good...about $30 or so for an entree with my juice choice each day.  Good large portions!  Yummy!"
"Staff were disorganized and out of synch.  Wife and I were seated at table covered by previous diner's dirty plates.  Appetizers were great and were served promptly.  But then the meal went downhill.  We waited 40 minutes for my entree and I was finished eating when my wife was served hers.  The food was good, not great.  Food did not merit rave reviews we had heard about.  We had a much more satisfying meal at the Grand Wok at MGM Casino."
Wow the place is great. I am a noodle freak by nature and this is a must to try when in Vegas. Don't forget to ask for the special as it was my favorite.
"Decided to grab some food late after a night of gambling. The scenery/setting was bang on but the lady who was serving wasn't the best, very abrupt when ordering from the menus and when we had nearly finished eating she took the sauce which we were still using. Saying this the food was really good but the overall experience could have been excellent with better manners. 

Come on bellagio sort it out."
"Nice place for a casino restaurant.  They don't take reservations, so you may have a wait.  We have eaten here twice and each entry and appetizer was very tasty.  The service is excellent, friendly and attentive."
"Lunch here was big servings and excellent food.  The service was excellent, what you would expect from a top Las vegas restraunt"
"The food was good, definitely better than what we can get at China Town, but not the best. The dim sum were okay, not the best. I like that they don't make the dim sum greasy. The beef chow fun was satisfactory but not exceptional.
I especially like their beef fried rice though, had it twice during my 2 week stay in vegas. My stomach wasn't feeling well sometimes and the beef fried rice seemed to do the trick.
The service was good. I don't think there is MSG as I don't have my allergic reaction after eating there. MSG free food is always worth it. I think I will go back especially for their beef fried rice."
"Huge range of the usual Chinese fare, but fantastic quality."
great food - dim sum and a nice hot soup was a treat - at 3 am!
"Good food, but nothing to write home about. We enjoyed our meal, but you can go off the strip for much better Asian food."
"Anyone who enjoys good Asian food should avoid this place. It is pretty hyped up as the 'best in Vegas' and if thats true it is a shame. It is very average fare, albeit reasonably priced. Plenty of other better options for eating throughout Vegas."
"This place is great.  Fast service, hot, fresh food and a varied menu. I am obsessed with Pot stickers as they're hard to get where I live in the UK, and theirs are amazing. 

The restaurant is definitely not the cheapest but it's my favourite and the fact that you can walk up and get a table within 5 minutes at the height of lunch is an added bonus.  I will be going back next time we're there.  Finding it difficult to find any faults at all, so I won't!"
We had a short wait for a table but good value quality food in a casual atmosphere.
Nice and reasonably priced alternative in Mandalay Bay. Food came quickly and was very good
"We had a craving for Chinese noodles while staying at the Bellagio and this restaurant was convenient.  We had the pan fried dumplings which were made in house and were good.  My husband had the BBQ pork noodle and I had the shrimp wonton noodle soup.  Both were good, fresh and had generous amounts of ingredients. Coming from Toronto, we are fortunate to have access to great Chinese food and this restaurant is comparable to the good ones, but at more than double the price. Service was attentive and without pretentiousness that is found at other Vegas restaurants.   I would consider this to be a reasonable lunch in an upscale Vegas hotel."
The service was mediocre and the food pretty good. We enjoyed it but wouldn't have went back for more.
I'm vegetarian and they had plenty of choice on the menu.
"We got take out from Noodles when we had the taste for fried rice. We were both disappointed. We expected more being in the Bellagio. Especially for the price, it was just no where near as good as our local Thai place back home. The fried rice was dry and the shrimp appetizer we had was nothing special. 

We had:
CRABMEAT FRIED RICE $23 (Silver fish, lump crabmeat, green onion, egg)
MALAYSIAN FRIED RICE $20 (BBQ pork, egg, cabbage,
green onion, chili sauce)"
It was convenient especially if you want a light meal after experiencing one of the buffets!  We had soup noodles
"Located in the Bellagio Hotel, this small restaurant serves a variety of Oriental cuisines.  The Chinese food on the menu was reasonably tasty and authentic.  Rather expensive though for what you get but if you are craving for a taste of the Orient, this place will satisfy you.  Decor is very nicely done."
"The aroma as you walk to the entrance made us hungry, and the food met our expectiations.  It was delicious.  Atmosphere is fun.  We would definitely return. :)"
"A good place for a quick dinner, delicious and great cocktails."
"Wanted a quick meal, so popped into Noodles.  The staff were friendly and informative.

Food was gorgeous and spicy.

Will definitely be back!!"
"Whenever I'm in Vegas, I always get a craving for the food at Noodles. It's simple, tasty good food. Don't forget to try the Dim Sum on weekends. Freak out your friends by ordering the chicken feet..Yummy"
"Every time we are here we make a point to go here! Located in the far left back corner of the Bellagio, which is beautiful on it's own, Noodles has amazingly fantastic incredibly authentic food! Never know who you might see there also! Everything we've had here is amazing and we've taken our families there too. Everyone loved it! Can't recommend anything particular because we've had so much there!"
Really nice food at a good price and its open till 1am which is handy for late arrivals!
The food is good but one of the Asian waitress didn't seem so friendly.
"Very good restaurant tucked away in the corner of the Bellagio.  It was  a welcome change from all the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Beautiful restaurant with great food.  We had the Pot Stickers, Shiu Mau, Mandarin Beef Stew Noodles which had awesome flavor.  Shrimp balls just ok for me but others in the group loved them.  Staff was friendly, service maybe a little slow, prices reasonable.  It appeared there were repeat customers. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
"Great pan-Asian fare, decently priced.  There will likely be a wait, but it will be worth it.  Stylish decor, excellent food, good variety, great service."
We dined here on a Saturday afternoon so were able to order from the dim sum carts.  Everything was so delicious that the bill really added up by the end of the meal.  The service was very prompt and efficient.  We'll be back!
"Gold Coast Hotel and Casino have a wonderful, hidden secret in Noodles.  It is a very good Chinese restraunt.  The prices are reasonable and the food very good.  I am partial to the Won Ton Soup.  A little on the small side so go outside the normal Las Vegas Lunch times."
"My husband and I had lunch at Noodles in the Bellagio with our friends on Saturday, March 17, 2012. I ordered the Hong Kong Egg Noodes (crispy) and was not disappointed. My husband had Sweet & Spicy Noodles, which he thoroughly enjoyed. My friends also enjoyed their meals, though the one who ordered the Pad Thai would have liked it a bit spicer, but she did say that it was the best pad thai she's ever eaten. Also, the Dim Sum cart is a must! Come hungry and leave happy, but be prepared for a wait getting in ... Noodles just might be Vegas' best kept secret lunch spot!"
"We had some traditional and not so traditional asian meals.  The big hit was the pork Pad Thai - unexpectedly delicious!  The staff here was firendly, courteous and great to deal with."
The food was pretty good but the servers didn't seem too excited to be there.
This place has pretty authentic chinese dish for the noodles.  Recommend this place if you are hungry
"We had some traditional and not so traditional asian meals.  The big hit was the pork Pad Thai - unexpectedly delicious!  The staff here was firendly, courteous and great to deal with."
"This is a fun place for lunch.  They have great flavors, fresh ingredients, array of choices and our service was good as well."
"We had such a wonderful surprise when the food that we ordered came  and tasted exactly how we imagined. I'm from Singapore, and was pleasantly surprised to find Roti Prata (Indian style pan fried flat bread) under the appetizer menu, which was crispy and yummy. What more when it was served with fish curry (which would have made any South Indian chef proud). 

We tasted so many dishes like; Singapore Fried Bee Hoon, Penang Fried Kway Teow, Dim Sum (in various forms), beautiful fried rice and vegetable dishes. Portions were great. Having been in the US for 3 weeks made me down the familiar flavors with enthusiasm.  Not only did they have Singaporean / Malaysian dishes, they had a great selection of Chinese cuisines too:)

Noodles did not disappoint. The staff are very knowledgable. Service is efficient. Friendly too :) The Manager Yan (hope I got her name right) was really wonderful, as she advised us about the different types of cuisines available at Noodles. 

I would definitely go back there the next time I visit Vegas."
"Great food and great selection  spoilt a little by poor service, food was excellent and a fair price. well recommended."
We went to Noodles before our show at the Bellagio.  There was a small wait- but it went quickly.  The prices are reasonable and my companion and I shared our plates.  We had some dumplings and vegetable tempura.  For our main course we had a spicy noodle dish with chicken.  Very good.  Nice atmosphere and welcoming staff.
"Because it's in the Bellagio I expected there to be a wait to be seated so that wasn't surprising. What did surprise me was how long it took for someone to come to our table. We were seated and waited about 7 minutes before someone came to the table and ask us if we were ready to order but we had to ask for water. 

I got an appetizer that was 2 steamed rolls and it had a bean sauce on it. The appetizer was DELICIOUS but I got it after everyone else at the table already had theirs. As a matter of fact, I was still eating it when my food came. I got the Hong Kong Noodles with shrimp and it was fantastic!!!!

We were largely ignored throughout the meal by everyone and had to request drinks a second time. However, when it came time to pass out the bills a woman who was nice and sweet showed up to ask us  how we were and how our food was. Where were we from? Where are we staying? 

Anyway, the food was wonderful and it was an excellent price but I'd have to think about going back. That's my internal conflict."
"The service is good, the food came fast, and the cleanliness of the place was good. I would come back to eat here. The cuisine is more of a traditional chinese menu rather then a restaurant that has westernized chinese food."
"I love this hidden gem at the Bellagio. Great run, great menu and always what you expect If I am staying at the Bellagio and what Asian. I go to Noodles"
"I was truly relieved when discovered Noodles at Bellagio. Its no reservations, long hours of operation policy saved us from starvation one day. Definitely a rare place at Bellagio where you can always drop by and choose from an extensive menu of Asian dishes. Don't remember what we ordered, but everything was pretty decent, inexpensive, served efficiently and in not kitschy interior. When hungry, go Noodles:-)"
"We had a superb dim-sum lunch at Noodles. If you eat nothing else, try their shrimp balls---incredibly good. Surprisingly the egg rolls were not very tasty, but everything else we tried had wonderful tastes and was super fresh. There is a line to get in, but worth the wait."
"We wanted good Chinese before we left town from this trip. The concierge recommended Noodles as we were staying at Bellagio. It was really authentic and delicious. We ordered many dishes to share amongst the family (4 of us). The vegetable tempura was fresh and non-greasy, the crab fried rice was devine with big chunks of fresh crab meat. The pot stickers were good as was the barbecue dish which included duck, pork and chicken - tender and succulent. We will go back there on our next trip. Very friendly and accommodating wait staff - kept track of everything."
"The easist way to describe this restaurant is this:

The food is like your average Chinese lunch restaurant, but with notably better decor. The food is completely competent, but not memorable. Anything you try will be fine.

The prices are above what you would pay for a similar meal back home, but less than you'll pay elsewhere inside the Bellagio. We paid less here, for instance, than we paid at the Bellagio buffet the next day.

Realistically 3.5 stars if Tripadvisor had such a setting."
"We had a horrible experience here. We did several dim sum items that were recommended by our waiter... Everything taste the same, it was greasy and hardly had any flavor or inspiration. The meal was expensive for not a lot of food. We sat in very tight quarters where I sat by the backroom door where every time they opened the door I could see the dirty plates stacked up as well as the garbage. Yuck! On top of everything else, my husband and I had horrible bathroom experiences afterwards. Enough said...

Stay away! So many other good choices to choose from! Yuck!"
Okay place to eat. Not very crowded so no wait.  Service good.
Every type of Asian food availiable. It's all great !
"The food here is great, and I don't just mean by late night standards.  While it may not be the very best asian restaurant in Vegas, it is certainly as good as any in other major cities I have visited in North America. I haven't found a better late night place to eat in Vegas."
"I was expecting a diversity of noodles from around the world type of options. Not so but we ordered a few dishes we were not familiar with and were very pleased. The favors of all four of our dishes was exotic and tasty. Noodle dishes seemed like a cross with Japanese, Thai and Chinese influence. Cost was a bit on the pricey side (it is in the Bellagio Hotel); the tourist guide indicated it was a $$ for price but maybe closer to $$$.  Dining is close to your neighbor type of seating; everyone looks at their neighbor to see what they are eating. In any event, we would return  to dine again."
Always eat here at least once when in Vegas. Wonderful food. The dim sum is great. Menu selections wide and varied. The food is always hot. The service is prompt.
beef noodle soup...two slices of fatty beef with two huge chunks of more fat.  all for $18.00
"Had a really good simple lunch here, delicious Chinese vegetables, fried tofu, etc etc liked it a lot service was good not too expensive."
A varied menu but I've had far better noodle dishes.
"Delicious. We went there twice in 5days. Great portions, good price, amazing food."
Large portions and decent prices...especially for a place right on the strip. Open late for night owls with appetites. Ill be back for sure.
"After all the heavy eating in upscale restaurants in Vegas on expense account, last night before flying out I went to Noodles, and it totally delivered. Excellent ramen soup: ate every drop of it. Fast and unobtrusive service."
"A great variaty of choice, freshly cooked Asian delights, effeciently served with a good wine list offered, good for lunch or dinner, a popular coice especially with many Asian peolpe eating there the day we visited"
My wife had low expectations.  We had a wonderful and fun meal!
"Very quick service, good range of items to order. The food was really tasty and not too spicy ( we purposefully ordered the milder food) We wanted something quick and tasty because we were starving after a tough day sightseeing!  Portions are massive, so after questioning our (not very friendly) server as to portion sizes and looking at others' plates coming from the kitchen, we ordered different things to share!"
Not a bad option if you are in the mood for Asian food.
"It is a very good choice for lunch.  It has an extensive menu, but the one I tried often and highly recommend is the Thai Spicy Shrimp Noodle Soup. I always stop by when I am close by for lunch.  It is good for a quick bite, not a sit down establishment, so do not expect much of service."
The food was good but the service can be a bit more friendly.   The food was a bit pricey as well.
"Great service and food, not too pricey for the venue. No need to book."
"Quality food and good service made for a pleasant dining experience, with prices that did not require you to win big at the tables."
"Love it here. Not cheap but great food and a counter Area for Solo travellers, convenient for the Casino and open til late. Fab Soup noodle"
"Waited at empty door for 10 mins.eventually  shown to a seat squished between two other couples so we requested a table that hadn't been cleaned yet. Sure,she said,I'll get it cleaned. After 10 mins it still wasn't cleaned and we asked what was happening-she refused to clean it- obviously too good for that-and said we had to wait for someone else. We left 5 mins later. We were staying in hotel  and eaten here twice before. Both times food was fine but service not great. Try changs bistro across at planet hollywood-its amazing!"
"The food was pretty good and they have a great variety but the service was just mediocre.  There were some regulars there that got great service and attention but that wasn't us.  If you want a more casual option at Bellagio, this would be a good option but I would probably just go to the buffet next time- same price in the end and I don't have to wait for someone to pay attention to what I need because I can get it myself."
"I love the food here!  Have been here for lunch and dinner. Portions are large so order different things and share them. There's this great Thai ice tea, very nice. They are very accommodating if you have any food issues like gluten, dairy etc.
Don't be discouraged if you see a line up at the door, this is the norm, you won't wait that long.
I go here every time I go to Vegas, it's become a ritual.   Have told friends and family and have heard no complaints."
"After reading some very good things about this, we decided to take a look. We got several different dishes and unfortunately, not one of them passed muster.  One we sent back because the meat actually smelled ""off"".  Each dish seemed ""off"" so much so that 2 hours later we were all quite unwell.   
Definitely will be skipping this on our next trip."
Great value and delicious food.  They have very generous portions.  One of my favorite places to eat.
"these noodle soups and dishes are definitley inflated by las vegas prices. i grew up eating these classic asian noodle dishes and while they arent the cheap bowls you can get for $5 in nyc chinatown, theyre good and fulfill your craving while away from home. expect to pay almost $20 a person for just an entree dish of noodles. no complaints on taste of food though. the menu is large and there will most definiltey be something for everyone. located in the casino near the lobby of the bellagio. great way to satisfy a craving! our waitress was very informative on the menu items and knowledgable about them as well. just a bit too pushy for me though."
"Stayed in the bellagio and saw the ad for noodles, went on our last night and waited 15 mins for a table, lovely choice on the menu, and the dim sum was very yummy, as were the noodles, we had pork and veg dumplings, chicken pad Thai, and a bbq pork and veg noodles. Worth the wait, but I did find the service a little cold and clinical."
"Stopped in to have a quick bite to eat, well priced, quick service and the best part is that they didn't make me feel awkward for dining solo!"
"I came in in the afternoon for their weekend Dim Sum. I had five items, which were across the board uninspiring. I know Dim Sum diners in the US can suffer from ""a little too much authenticity"" when enjoying this tradition, but I've really liked Dim Sum at other places, so I felt like I knew what I was getting into.

Nothing glaringly wrong here, items were just a little less than I'd hoped for. Beef Short Ribs were really greasy, Vegetable Dumplings were chewy, though the filling was fresh and good. Sesame Balls were good, Barbecued Pork Buns were light and puffy, though underfilled.

In the end I was presented a bill with items on it I did not have, but the problem was rectified quickly."
"This is a great place for dimsum in the afternoon, or a late night snack. The service is good and the noodles are swoon-worthy. The barbeque pork, pad thai with shrimp, and the shu mai are fantastic. I could eat there everyday. My friend wanted to take the chef home with her!"
Amazing food. We are vegetarians and while the menu did off a few choices the waitress was nice enough to get some of the non veg dishes converted to vegetarian. Great taste and atmosphere.bit of a wait especially on the weekend but worth it.
eaten here a few times and will always go back. better than most and clean.
"We went there twice and both times had no trouble getting seated without waiting. The place was open late so we went about 9:40pm after a show.  I had some tasty appetizers followed by fantastic bok-choy in garlic, vegie-fried rice, and roast duck.  One member of out party had the Roast Duck noodles. We loved the duck and envious of the soup I went back another day just for the Noodles with duck ($15 perfect).  Other members let me try their Beef Stew it was, in my opinion, not as good as the duck.
I recommend adding the red pepepr garlic sauce to spice it up."
We lined up on a Saturday afternoon at 1:30 PM for half an hour and were finally seated at the counter.  We were looking forward to trying the Thai and Japanese food.  We were disappointed to find out it was all basically Chinese food.  We even tried the Dim Sum and it  was good but not great.  We noticed that the Bellagio restaurants we visited this time were not as good as they were a year ago.  That is too bad because it is convenient to eat in the hotel you are staying in.  When the food is on the pricey side in a casino you would expect a little higher end food.
I liked that there was such a big selection of noodles.  They were combined with delicious meats and vegetables.  I give them 10/10
"late lunch at about 1:30 and had to wait about 45 minutes, even though there were empty tables.  once we sat down, one of the dim sum carts came by, but we wanted to see the menu first.  we had one order off the menu and the rest of us, just wanted dim sum; then had to wait another 15 minutes for the dim sum cart to come back by.  for what we ordered, our lunch took about 2 hours.  service was very slow and then not helpful and at times rude.  definitely cross this off my list of restaurants i want to revisit."
"Vistied here twice during a stay in Bellagio. Dim Sum is very good, highly recommend the shrimp balls. Noodle and rice dishes were also were good, although the Pad Thai was a bit oily, apart from that a great place to go for lunch or early dinner."
"Nice light meal options after a show, we had the noodle soup and laksa which was very tasty."
My favourite soup and noodle restaurant in the world.
"Like any other places in Vegas in the Casino it was over priced... crappy noodles that didn't taste rigth, dim sum was ok... It was just an average chinese place with over priced menus. Go eat at Panda express!"
loved the food here and service was great.  One of the better ones at the Bellagio
Best asian food and don't forget to try their ice cream desert!
"My extended Chinese family and I are getting the biggest chuckle because this meal easily set the record for the most expensive Chinese meal we have ever had!

Noodles is in the beautiful Bellagio casino, so one must keep in mind that the $$ rating is in relation to your other pricey dining options in the resort. Our table of 7 adults and 2 small children rang up a tab of $220 (including automatic 18% gratuity added to the tab). I will concede that we ate here because we needed a convenient quick option before a show, but our Chinese genes were offended by the price in comparison to the quality of the food. We could have easily had a sumptuous meal in Las Vegas' Chinatown for a lot less.

The menu has many authentic Chinese dim, sum, noodle, rice and other dishes. The fried dumplings were good. Authentic Chinese sweet peas leaves were excellent, as were Hong Kong ""chow mein"" fried noodles and authentic ""dried tofu with black mushrooms."" But I was frankly offended by the $33 steamed sea bass - at that price I expected the authentic ""whole fish"" in the traditional Chinese style, but what came out was a palm-sized slice of a snapper filet. We also joked that the steamed rice must be very special because they only gave us 2 bowls! Also, another annoying thing was that our meal came out piecemeal rather than at once.

The service staff is native Asian, speaks Chinese, and is friendly and courteous. 

In summary, the food and service were good, but this is definitely not the low-budget price tag you expect for Chinese food - especially in a town with a huge Chinatown."
We liked this restaurant.  It was more like eating in a regular restaurant than in this huge hotel.  The food was nice quality and the service was good.
Good food and open later than the other restaurants. No reservation and located in the casino area. A little pricey but very good and nice portions.
Honestly I won't recommend this Place to anyone unless you have an urgent need for Chinese food like I did the other day. The f
this place must be one of the most popular restaurant outlets.  Very nice Asian food at 'affordable' price - in comparison to other restaurants in the casino.  The only problem is getting a seat!
"Went there for lunch and had to try the dim sum.  Loved it.  Instead of ordering from the menu you can hail one of the dim sum carts making it's way around the restaurant.  A terrific array of small plated bites.  Everything from bbq to shanghai dumplings and they charge you by the plate.  One of my plates were the shanghai dumplings which had 3 on the plate and I tried one other item with a soft drink and my bill was around $12.00 and i was full.  
I would definitely go back and if too late for the dim sum cart the menu looked interesting as well"
We enjoyed a terrific late night meal--by our standards after 10 pm. great service and food.
We were looking for a delicious Asian restaurant and found Noodles tucked away in the Bellagio.  It was very good and the service was excellent!  It was also very affordable and the portion sizes were great for sharing.  We will definitely visit again!
"I really wanted to try Noodles since it was a restaurant in the Bellagio and you know it had to be good, but it wasn't.  I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Noodle with Shrimp.  It was probably the worst meal I ate during my entire trip.  The shrimp were nice and big but the dish was very bland and not very tasty at all.  I expected more from this restaurant especially being in a 5-star hotel, but  ended up very disappointed.  If you want an excellent noodle dish, go to Wazuzu at Encore hotel."
This restaurant was fantastic!  Everything that arrived on our table was delicious.  I didn't leave any crumbs.  So much flavor.  Great drinks and beer selection as well.  I'd highly recommend it!!
"Had some duck noodle dish, very delightful.  Lots of Asians here sampling the dishes, a good sign for the overall quality.  A decent value for Bellagio dining, most meals $15-$25.  A more flavorful alternative to PF Changs.  Design and space could use a little more flair.  Decoration was mostly jars of dried noodles, not so amazing."
"Given the high profile location at the Bellagio, i would have expected much better.  OK, noodles are noodles but the meal here was bland, oily and just not worth half what we paid.  Pork rib dumplings where nothing but fat and bone fragments that you had to be VERY careful whilst eating or you would choke or cut your mouth on the sharp bone.  Sadly one of the worst meals we have had in the US."
"The menu looks enticing with a lot of different noodle and rice dishes. We tried 5 different dishes. Some were rated spicy, and others mild. As it turned out, everything (even the items rated spicy) were bland. I ordered the spicy Hor Fun noodles with chicken and it was covered in a gummy tasteless sauce. Another family member ordered the sweet and spicy noodles and though they weren't spicy, they were tasty. The barbecued pork was just okay. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items, but no one at our table was overly impressed with their meal. We all felt dehydrated later that night, and couldn't drink enough water, so I suspect the food was quite salty. The portions were huge and the wait staff was efficient, but the food really wasn't very good.."
"Dictated by my Chinese wife.
We ate lunch there during the week.  I had the seafood soup of the day, it was very easy to make, taste is OK.  My husband had dan dan noodles, not like china noodles, didn't taste fresh made and not very spicy.  The beef didn't have any extra seasoning.
My noodles were only average, not spicy either.
I wish we would have had time to try the rice and vegetables, they looked very good.
We each had an appetizer and an entree for $50."
"We dined here 3 times in 5 days, the food was always fantastic, service fast & not cheap & nasty but quality food. Also funky surrounds. The pineapple fish dish is the best also the Tom yum soup, wonton."
"Wow, the noodles were fresh and the seasoning was perfect.  We ordered the Pad Thai, Penang and another one with Crab.  All were excellent.  The crab one had delicious blue crab meat in there and even large lumps too.  It was fresh and very sweet.  The Pad thai was very good with large shrimp and the Penang wasn't seasoned as good as the Pad Thai, but still very good.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was typical.  I know it's Vegas prices but, we ordered 4 dishes and just water and it was $84 before tip.  Come on, noodles are soooo cheap!"
"delicious and pricey, my wife and I is looking for a nice hot soup. we ended up here. the seating is okay. very few seats. so we end up seating to the adjacent restaurant."
"I was there with my 9month old while hubby was taking a nap.  If you're craving for dim sum and Asian food, this is pretty good.  But get ready for the price tag.  Dim sum can run $3.75 per dish and upward.   They need more variety on the dim sum.  I ordered some rice noodle soup with white chicken, that's $15 and it was small bowl.  I spent $28 by myself for that noodle and 2 dim sum dishes.  With that said, if you don't mind paying for average good Chinese food, it's fine here."
Chicken pad thai was disappointing -wide noodles were oily and tasted more like a beef hot fun dish. Iced tea drinks never arrived and the waitress didn't even ask if anything was okay. Worse part was the wait time to be seated. Be prepared to stand a long time in line. Not recommended if you're hungry and want prompt service.
"First off, we really went here because it was low to mid-range prices.  There wasn't a line at the time we ate, and it's a little hidden and pretty cramped inside, but it's the cheapest place to eat in the Bellagio.  My husband and I shared a duck and bbq pork combo plate, 2 bowls of rice, and the mango sticky rice for dessert.  I loved the duck, it was juicy and cooked just right.  My husband liked his pork too and the portions were just right for us to eat it all.  Also, that mango sticky rice was really delicious!  It wasn't blow my mind great food, but it was satisfyingly tasty.  Trying to order just the right amount of food is really hard and we don't have fridges to take our leftovers back to, so I liked the portions they have here.   It was pretty busy, so our water wasn't kept filled.  The food came out pretty quickly, but once it was there, we really didn't hear from the server again.  Overall, the food was tasty, the restaurant was small and cramped, the service was just o.k., the price was right, but I wouldn't wait in line for it."
"Noodles at the Venetian is the best Asian in Vegas.  We ate there five times in three days.  It's the main reason we stay there.  Generous helpings, reasonable prices, great food.  Lunch, dinner, snacks...anytime it is great."
Simple to review–not as advertised. The Pad Thai Chicken was a poor choice with wide egg noodles and not rice noodles. My wife's KungPao Beef was missing ingredients. Just not worth the wait to be seated.
Good chinese food at Bellagio. The problem is that the restaurant has no view and is very small.
Nice atmosphere and good cuisine at a relatively affordable price. Nice portions and large selection of menu items.
"A little hard to find, but well worth it! Visited at lunch and got a table right away. Service was good but the food was amazing. Spouse and I both got noodle dishes that were huge and wonderful. Was our last day or we would have returned every day. Highly reccommend."
Four of us went for lunch and only one was satisfied. Too greasy for my liking and the taste was just meh. For these prices I expect a lot more.
"One of our better meals in vegas.  Lines out the door.  Great meal, super friendly service.   Original menu with dishes I have never had!  A bit pricy but very good."
"With few choices for dining after 10:30, you get what you would expect.  The Bellagio was sold out the night of our visit and Noodles was very busy.  Staff was overwhelmed, long line while several tables remained open but dirty for 5-10 minutes.

Food is decent to good- a bit salty and they do get it out to you fairly quickly.  Shrimp and pork pot stickers were worth ordering again.  

Again, for late dining, it fills you up and is not terribly priced."
"Service and atmosphere- we waited 15min in line. Although we had to wait a bit, it was clear the food was popular. (We were a little disappointed they did not take reservations) The atmosphere was modern and clean- nothing too fancy. The waiters did not seem overly friendly but they were efficient with drink and food orders. Our food took less than 15min to arrive.

Portions and taste- we ordered chicken chow mein and shrimp penang rice noodles. Bother both dishes were absolutely delicious (if you are sensitive to salt, we suggest asking for reduced sodium). We were glad that we did not order an appetizer- as the portions were quite generous and we couldn't finish our whole plate. The pricing was fair given the location and the cuisine. 

Bottom line- great spot to have an informal dinner at a moderate price."
"Pretty expensive for what you get. I got the Sweet & Spicy Noodles with beef. It was great, and was tons of food. My wife got two appetizers.. spring rolls and another with three skewers of beef. Hers wasn't anything special, and was not much food at all, yet it cost as much as if she had gotten a noodle dish. She ended up eating what I couldn't finish of mine. The service was good, but we did have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated even though there were empty tables around us. Like I said in the title, I wouldn't wait in line to eat there."
"Fast, fresh, friendly and tasty. The servings are large and of very good quality. Service was goodbwithout being excellent. Menu is very good and had the items we were familiar with. 
The noodle soup with BBQ pork is very good. The Mongolian beef is excellent.
We ate there twice and were not disappointed either time."
"I can eat here every day when I'm in Vegas. The service seemed to have declined in the past year. When we came in previous years, the wait-staff seemed more smiley. The high prices are probably just reflective of high-end Vegas casinos in general, but one would assume the relative high price would come with more attentive service. 

However, despite the rant above, it's still my favorite staple restaurant on the strip. Who could argue, judging from the long line-ups throughout the day? 

Plus, when the food comes, one forgets the mediocre service. The Chilean Sea-Bass (steamed, with the ginger/garlic sauce) is just to die for. The beef noodle soup (substitute with Udon noodles), a delight! The Roti with dipping sauce, Mmmm! Even the salad, the fresh juices, most dishes are great. The only thing I'd say is that if you're sensitive to salt, ask for less salt. They'll do it (maybe not with a smile), but they will take requests. I also, quite enjoy the bright, cheerful atmosphere... quite reflective of Bellagio, even though it's a Chinese dim-sum-ish joint.

... and to be honest, I don't mind un-cheerful service when the food comes out as fast as it does here! If you have a Chinese-y appetite, you just might end up craving the food here, even late at night!"
"Ate at Noodles over a year ago and was surprised at the current reviews. During this Bellagio stay would have avoided Noodles but various circumstances left few options for quick meal at 10:00pm on Tues night. 
MGM must have also read the reviews and taken names and kicked a__.
Place was full, welcomed at door, table being cleared as we were escorted there, water there in seconds after we sat, Ricky the waiter took the drink orders immediately (based on other reviews I was ready with my stop watch to time all these actions) and was there as soon as we were ready to order and he was busy, pot stickers arrive shortly with the entrees at an appropriate interval, water glasses refilled, and a quick signal to Ricky got the bill settled and we were on our way.  All those around us seemed to receive similar treatment.
The food was good enough for the price.  The pot stickers had plenty of filling, the barbecue duck had no bones and lots of meat with crispy skin. Beef brisket was fork tender and flavoable. All portions generous. The barbecue pork was the biggest disappointment, flavor correct but dry and little stringy - not up to any street vendor standards in Asia. 
Overall, I would say well done MGM for cleaning up an obvious mess.
For ""cheaper"" eats in the Bellagio give it another chance!"
"Had an early dinner at Noodles last week.  No wait to eat, food served promptly.  It was just o.k.  The best feature of the restaurant was quick service.  I had the shrimp won ton soup and my friend has the chicken pad thai.  All in all, just average."
"I had an appetizer of edamame (look up how to eat it before you order!) and a cup of the spicy shrimp noodle soup for my main course for lunch.  I had just flown in from Cleveland and hadn't eaten anything all day so while it was late lunch time in Vegas, it was dinner time for my stomach.  I was ravenous.  The edamame was good.  It was my first time eating it and wasn't really anything to write home about.  The soup, on the other hand, was out of this world.  The broth was addicting.  I could drink that broth at all hours of the day or night.  The shrimp were very fresh.  I was very happy with the food.  The service was lacking, though.  My waiter at least paid me some attention when I flagged him down.  I saw other patrons getting blown off by their waitstaff.  It didn't seem to matter if you were Asian or not, you got the same lousy service.  Expect to spend some time here.  Enjoy it for what it is.  Good food, poor service."
"I only ate dim sum at Noodles. They offer a large menu as well, but I did not try it. 

Noodles is an above average dim sum place located inside the Bellagio. Some of their offerings are exceptionally good, but they have a limited selection of dim sum. It is also considerably more expensive than dim sum I have eaten in various Chinatowns. It is relatively cheap compared to other options in the Bellagio. 

On the plus side, the service was amazing, and the restaurant is cleaner and more upscale than anywhere I have had dim sum. 

We are going back tomorrow for more dim sum."
"Surprised by some of the poor reviews here. We turned up at the restaurant without a booking. Got seated within 5  minutes. Service wasnt oustanding but was good.
Food quality was very good, we loved it. Portions are very big so dont get carried away. Try the vegetable spring rolls and the shrimp in black bean sauce - yummy."
"Let me preface this review by saying that me and my guests that evening are all employed in the service and hospitality industry. One of us there is a GM for a high end steakhouse. Another is an owner of an exclusive cigar bar and the last being a senior server at the previously metioned steakhouse. Combined, there was 60 years of restaurant experience sitting at the table. WE KNOW how things can go wrong and execution may not be perfect everytime. I'm the first person to give someone the benefit of a doubt when things are really busy or whatever......I can empathize because I've been there.....I know how employees can ""get in the weeds"". 

Having said that. The dining experience at ""Noodles"" in the Bellagio was FLAT OUT DEPLORABLE!!! The service I recieved there was an embarassment to anyone in the industry. It was the first time I had ever been in an establishment where NOONE cared. About anything!

 They didn't care we stood at the host stand for 15 mins before the hostess (who was standing there the whole time) would take our name.(They were NOT busy...about 9pm on a Monday night)

They didn't care that half the restaurant needed to be bussed and they had guests waiting in plain sight and the staff is just standing there....looking at each other like ""Who want to bus these tables so we can get some people seated"".

They didn't care to give us any water or acknowledge our exsistance for the first 10 mins.

They didn't care if I wanted anything to drink.

They didn't care if we wanted an appetizer.

They didn't care if I had any questions.

They didn't care if the food was prepared correctly after we had been served.

They didn't care that we may have wanted our plates removed 15 mins after we've push them all to the center of the table trying to signal to them we were finished. (This one really burned me because I'm literally looking directly into the eyes of the other servers and bussers saying..""Please take my plates away"" and they look back at me and then walk away....really?)

And of course....They didn't care if we wanted anything else (coffee, desert, etc)....or the check for that matter......It took about a minute of flapping my arms like a chicken before they got me the bill.

I am not a complainer! This is the first time I've ever taken any time out of my day to write anything about any restaurant. But the way I was treated with such disregard and insignificance, I was force to let others know that the service here truly STINKS!

On a brighter note the food there was quite good and arrived promptly and hot, but it couldn't make up service."
"Stopped in for a quick dinner and absolutely loved the food.  Flavorful pot stickers, delicious soup, and wontons really filled with shrimp.  The prices weren't outrageous, which was a nice surprise.  Service is a little gruff and we had trouble flagging down servers, but the food comes out hot and quick.
Enjoy and win big!"
"We had great expectations about this restaurant. We'd been to Bellagio's other Asian restaurant, Sensi, which was spectacular. There is just this expectation that if it is in the Bellagio, it couldn't be too bad. The owners or management of this restaurant could do a couple of things to enhance the place. First, train the staff on customer courtesy. While we encountered a couple of wonderful employees, most of them, including our waiter, just didn't seem to care. Couldn't give a (guess). He wanted the order now, or faster, no exceptions, no smile, not even, ""I'll see what I can do for you."" We are very casual people, were dressed nicely, and didn't raise a stink, not even a whimper. The four of us all thought their meals were below par on the taste front. Is there quality control or quality assurance in the kitchen? Third, of the four of us, the first got their meal very quickly. Then two others about 10 to 15 minutes (really) later. Then the fourth about 10 minutes or more after that. By that time, the first one was stone cold. Maybe the manager was off duty last night, and his/her stand-in was in training."
"We were in Vegas with some friends and one of my friends was craving some asian noodles. So where better to go than Noodles we thought. Well, it was nothing special and was expensive when compared to the much better quality yet cheaper asian food we get back home in Vancouver. The portions are big though so keep that in mind when ordering. Each one of us ordered a dish and shared two small appetizers and we were no where close to finishing the dishes. Service was also average. All in all just an average place to eat, we will not be going back any time soon."
"All kinds of noodles at this Asian inspired restaurant which will appeal to children and to parents.  Casual, tasty, and well priced compared to other Vegas options."
"From the menu and its location in the Bellagio, I thought we were in for a good Asian meal.   I was wrong,  this place is really pretty bad and the service was just abysmal;  dishes brought out randomly, cold and poorly done,  and well below average in quality--like when you get home from the take out and have to examine the chicken to make sure it's chicken.  Service was just terrible,  one dinner never showed up at all,   the waitress disappeared on us,  just a very poor experience;  I highly recommend the Cafe in the Bellagio over this place, like night and day."
"We had lunch at Noodles and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal - chicken pad thai for my husband and sweet and sticky noodles with shrimp for me, massive portions (I couldn't finish mine) and nicely cooked and presented. We had a couple of different options from the Dim Sum and Wonton trollies that came past intermittently, which were all really tasty. 
The service was good and the selection of drinks was appropriate and reasonably priced. All in all, very worthwhile."
"Went to noodles, because we were at the Bellagio and looking for someplace to eat.  Had the edamame and beef and broccoli.  The food was okay, nothing great, but we were seated right away and our food arrived quickly.  Overall the service was average and eating here was nothing special.  Don't think I'll be back because there are so many better options in Vegas."
"The food is fantastic, and the prices are a fraction of the other restaurants in the resort."
"When we were in Vegas, we ate with some friends at Noodles and it was just great. We received our food withiin a timely manner and everything was delicious. We had shu mai, won ton soup, tofu, green tea, etc. No one complained about their meal. In fact, everyone gave it positive reviews. And, they never rushed us. We will definitely come back to Noodles next time we are in Las Vegas."
Had lunch here with about an hour wait - computers down - not their fault.  Loved everything - 5 people with about 8 different dishes.  Green beans were the best I have ever had outside of my home.  Best Pad Thai!
"This really is average dining in a town full of excellent dining options.  I can say that my noodle dish was actually good, but my wife didn't think much of hers, the service was poor, and the modern design of the place makes it feel way too cold/sterile to be among the really good Asian meals we've enjoyed.  In another lesser town, maybe this works better, but in Vegas with a thousand other options out there, this just blends in to the background.  Not worth a visit."
"We decided to try Noodles because the food was different from most other restaurants in Las Vegas. We ere seated quickly and found our server to be efficient and alert to our needs.We had a good meal. It was pricey but so are most hotel restaurants here. My husband and I shared an appetizer of spring rolls- 6 pieces - very good. Then I had the Hong Kong fried noodles with chicken, mushrooms, and bok choy; and my husband, the beef rice noodles. His meal was not as hot as it should have been. The person at the next table had the fried noodles with ribs and it turned out to be a very different dish than mine so ask first about what's on the menu. We ordered brown rice which was a mistake. It was not good while I'm sure their white rice would have been fine."
We enjoyed our lunch at Noodles - nice decor and a fabulous aroma throughout our meal - Service was good but minimal - Food was delicious but expensive
"This really is average dining in a town full of excellent dining options.

Not bad at all!  Service wasn't amazing but we were starving and the food was quite good!
Being from Knoxville we never have the opportunity to enjoy dim sum so when we read in the Bellagio restaurant guide in our hotel room that Noodles had dim sum on weekends we definately wanted to give it a try. The only other time we had enjoyed dim sum was on a trip to Seattle. We were taken to Chinatown then by a local. This dim sum was just as authentic and delicious as we remembered from our Seattle trip. Definately go if you enjoy something different and aren't afraid to try new things. The service was good and they will explain what each dim sum selection is made of. The restaurant was full the entire time we were enjoying our meal and had people waiting any other time we passed by it.  We did notice that there was only one other caucasian couple in the restaurant. Most customers were of Asian decent which only reinforced the authenticity of the cuisine for us.
"We just (5 mins ago) ate at Noodles because it is about the only thing that remains open past midnight at Bellagio. I wish that the experience had not happened. I wish I had just ordered room service. The highlights... the water was cold and the food was hot. The downside... the server was SO RUDE. Definitely below Bellagio standards. The food was bland and what you'd expect from a drive-through Asian restaurant, only worse. I had shrimp fried rice which contained only three shrimp, each hidden in the rice and all still had the tail on. Maybe this is traditional, but it was gross and we were given no knives. Soft drinks were $4 each... NO REFILLS. My husband is a professional grade coca cola drinker so this meant that his meal would be $20 for just his coke! The server said that was no big deal, it was like that everywhere at Bellagio (which it is not... this is the only place I've seen and I've eaten at all but two other restaurants. The atmosphere is stiff and VERY bright, even past midnight. No cushions on the solid bench seats. 

Bellagio is amazing and offers great food. Eat ANYWHERE else. There is a Panda Express in Luxor I believe... that would be a better choice than Noodles."
"The reviews for that place aren’t that great nowadays, but we really enjoyed our food.  We arrived at the Bellagio and were starving so we stumbled upon Noodles and waited about 20 minutes for a table.  There were 2 women walking around with different appetizer assortments and another woman with an assortment of dim sum.  We ordered sliced almond shrimp (3 huge shrimp in full slices of almonds, nice & crunchy from the almond and the shrimp had a great bite to them), shared an order of pan seared pot stickers from the regular menu appetizer section (very good, average) and shared the crab vermicelli.  Chunks of delicious crab mixed with green onions in vermicelli - it was so good and great portion size to share.  Beer for my husband and iced tea (free refills) for myself.  Bill was $50 before gratuity.

I would visit Noodles when we get to LV again, it was a nice way to start our vacation."
Went here hoping to get some authentic Asian food.  All it was was horrible soup and Americanized versions of Asian dishes.  Slow service as well.
"We had a large group, we were planning on dropping 30some dollars for a Dinner buffet, which we thought was a safe estimate. The cost was higher due to Mother's Day weekend, so the price rose to 43 bucks per person. We had a group discussion, and we bailed on the overpriced buffet (I am sure it was good), to Noodles at Bellagio.

We were surprised with the weight of the menu's, each menu was about 8 lbs ( not cool). The food selection was expansive,  and portions were large enough that each couple shared a main course and app. The Hostess was nice, our waiter was too, but he took strange amount of time to drop off the bill. He hammered it out and we cashed out. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes the types of food on the menu."
"My family and I love Asian food, so anywhere we travel we try some asian restaurants. We went to Las Vegas from April 6 thru 12. We decided to eat at Noodles in the Bellagio. Honestly is the worse asian food we ate. The brown rice was awful, sticky and unflavored. The soft drinks $4.00 each with no refill. We had to add soy sauce to everything to ate it."
"I've eaten at Noodles several times during Las Vegas trips and have to agree with other people that service is not the best with respect to friendliness and is inconsistent (sometimes I have a waiter coming by every three minutes and sometimes I have to flag someone down). But dim sum here has always been very good and made up for the service. Shanghai dumplings, shrimp dumplings, fired shrimp balls, and turnip cakes were all very good selections and I was never disappointed with the quality. Other than that, I have basically stuck with either pad thai noodles with shrimp or a chicken dish;  the quality and taste have always been good. Drinks are fairly large and usually don't need refilling often, so bad service don't cause that big a problem. If you can put up with the sometimes arrogant attitude, it can be a good experience. If you can't take the attitude, I suggest Red8 at the Wynn; food is just as good if not slightly better there, prices are comparable, and people are always very friendly."
"We ate at Noodles for lunch after not being able to find ANYTHING else open in many of the casinos for lunch. The food was standard fare chinese. The beef was very fresh though, which was the highlight. Don't go here if you are looking for original or authentic, but it was good chinese food for a reasonable price and not too greasy. Service and decor were also good too."
"We ate at Noodles twice during our stay - once as a late night meet, and once for lunch.

Service: The service was a bit hit and miss, sometimes very quick, sometimes a bit slow/difficult to find a server.  Front of house were considerate when we had luggage and offered to let us leave it with them.  

Food: High quality with huge portions.  Good for sharing, and there is also the option of a dim sum menu which was plentiful.  Food comes very quickly.

Value for money: Most reasonably priced restaurant in the Bellagio, but is definitely a more informal choice.  It is open from 11am - 2am, so good for a late night fix."
"I'll still eat here, just not as often as I'd like to.

The Dim Sum seems to match well with me and I have yet to find a dish that I'll dislike. I also enjoy the atmosphere so long as I/m seated away from the back corners.

The service needs an overhaul. The pace, timing, and communication are just all wrong. While I've never been treated rudely here, I'd like to see a waitstaff that's on top of things."
"I go to Vegas 2-3 times a year and almost always drop by noodles.

We usually get an appetizer or two and then one of the large yet ca mein/udon style soups.

I find the quality of the food to be very good and not too expensive.  It is a great place for lunch or a late night snack.

They also have a menu with chinese dishes served platter style however I have not tried those.

The dim sum is also very nice (fFriday-Sunday) but easily 2-3 times the cost you would find elsewhere."
"After seeing endless commercials for this ""Asian Fare"" restaurant on the TV in our Bellagio suite, my husband and I treated ourselves to an early dinner at Noodles, located on the Casino floor of the prestigious Vegas hotel. Having lived in China and traveled around Asia myself, I am always up for some ""authentic"" Asian cuisine, and as Noodles boasted renowned chefs and dishes, I figured this was our best bet. 
The only thing authentic about Noodles was its customers and staff, most of whom were Asian. My husband ordered the BBQ steamed bun appetizer, which was decent though nothing to write to Asia about. He also though ahead and ordered a $2.50 cup of white rice (no brown rice on the menu), while I ordered the Chinese broccoli ""entrée."" The dish was nothing more than a few large pieces of Chinese broccoli doused in a garlic sauce. Since of course there were no knives available, I had to gnaw at the broccoli bite by bite in order to finish the plate. The broccoli had been Americanized with its heavy, sugary sauce and was so fiber-esk that it was nearly inedible. By the end of the meal I had eaten more rice with soy sauce (the latter being the most delicious part of our ""meals"") and went back to my suite $30 bucks poorer. 

Go to Noodles if: You are with a family or group and intend to eat entrees in the authentically Asian ""family style"" (as they were most likely meant to be eaten); are willing to put out a good $20 per person minimum; if you want some Japanese sake or Tsing Tao beer for $7 a bottle (it's a quarter in China!); if you are an interior design buff who gets off on elaborate and somewhat exaggerated Chinese décor (which gets a bit overwhelming fast).

Don't go to Noodles if: You want a quality meal for two under $50, you prefer to cut your food before stuffing it in your mouth and gnawing off the leftovers."
"This is a stop we make every trip.  With Dim Sum and a contemporary Asian menu, it never displeases and is never so busy."
"Went to Noodles early on a Saturday night in mid June, 2008. Took my college-age daughter and when we arrived, there was a line outside the restaurant. We pleasantly waited for approximately 20 minutes and were then seated by the hostess. While walking through to our table, we noticed a handful of empty tables, which puzzled us as there was now a significant line waiting to get in.

We each ordered a noodle dish and some appetizers. My daughter, not liking spicy food, asked the waitress if her noodle dish could be made ""mild"" and without peppers. She indicated that it could. I ordered the ""Sweet and Spicy Noodles"" and even joked to add my daughters peppers to my dish. This simple order was screwed up (they made mine ""mild"") and my daughters was very spicy. In addition, both dishes were basically tasteless, need lots of salt and pepper to make them palatable. Added to this, the food took forever to come (maybe 25 minutes), and the restaurant continued to have empty tables despite the continual line outside. In addition, each time someone came by our table, it was someone different (probably four/five servers). Very poorly run establishment.

The kicker was that the soft drinks were $4.50, and the menu stated ""no refills"". The folks at the table next to us didn't notice this comment on the menu and when they asked if the refills were free, the servers visibly laughed and ridiculed them. How incredibly rude and cheaply run. If you're going to charge this much for a soft drink, why not allow refills?????????

Avoid at all costs. Yes, it's a glorified Panda Express, but not even as tasty (and I despise Panda Express)."
Bellagio's obligatory 'have to have an Asian concept' hidden in the back corner.  Was hoping for a little more.
"I had tofu and my partener had Laska noodles and it was very good. Sevice a bit slow as it was very busy. This is a popular spot!
I will go again!"
"We came for lunch around 3pm (I would not think there would be a crowd waiting to eat at this odd hour, but apparently I was wrong; we waited close to an hour in the smoke-filled casino to have the privilege of dining here).  The decor is nice enough (brown color scheme, Asian theme obviously), but the food is very expensive ($15 for a bowl of noodle soup?). I understand that this is Las Vegas, but we spend more than $60 on a meal that was completely unremarkable (a soup, a pad thai, one order of edamame, and two iced teas).  We eat much cheaper and better in ethnic restaurants in Boston.  I would not come back."
"We found little to like about Noodles on our dinner visit on Wednesday, May 30. The food was stunningly average at exorbitant prices and the service was almost non-existent. I'm pretty sure our server didn't speak English, because he didn't bother to say anything
to us other than ""Whatchu want?"" Hardly $20 an entree service at such
a beautiful hotel.

Save yourself the trouble and eat somewhere else where average pad thai won't set you back $19.50.

One positive however...the Funky Monkey drink was AMAZING. Blended banana and coconut milk with creme de cacao and some other liqueurs with toasted coconut on top. Heavenly."
"We had dinner at the Noodles. We enjoyed our food and the service was friendly and good. 
However, it was freezing cold in the restaurant and you had to eat really fast, because the warm (not hot) food went cold in minutes. While the food was hot in the wok in the kitchen, it was served on cold porcelain plates, and wtih the aircon set at about 60°F it was cold in no time."
"My wife and I just returned from a weekend in Las Vegas.  We ate a late lunch at Noodles and it was a truely great meal.  I had the duck with steamed rice and my wife had a selection if dim sum dishes from the cart.  Everything was incredibly fresh and the flavors were vivid.
Not getting an ""excellent"" score because the service could be improved.  It wasn't bad, but we had to wait to order, there didn't seem to be one particular server to take care of us, and I noticed that we weren't the only ones with this problem.  It was busy, however.
We'd go there again in a second."
"During my recent visit in Las Vegas, June 7-16 2005, I visited Noodle at Bellagio. 

Noodle, Bellagio
Shiu Mui
Ma Por Soft Diced Tofu
33 (including tip and tax)

Very good food and good service!"
"People working there has serious attitude problem. I went for a lunch, I got seated and I wanted to order but couldn't find my waiter. So, I called any waiter around me and said I was ready to order. But with the irritated look on her face she frowned at me and told me to just wait for my waiter. Although she did not say it out, her face was saying ""just SHUT UP and wait!"" I was so shocked that for the moment I forgot that I was her customer and I didn't know how to react to this. Other waiters had similar problems. Ordered food was thrown onto the table without a single word of what the name of the dish was. And, also it was almost impossible to get attention of any waiter. They simply didn't pay attention."
"Went here after the 10:30 O show, as Noodles stays open late. The pan-Asian menu includes Chinese, Thai, Japanese, and Vietnamese dishes. The portions are very good size, the prices aren't too bad (for Vegas), and the food is good. Service is very good too. The restaurant has fun decor!"
"Nice place but for a restaurant inside the Bellagio we expected better in terms of service especially. The waitress kept coming to take our order, without giving us time to choose. Hearty, decent dishes, very spicy for some, more bland for others. Bottle for €75 placed directly on the table, without ice bucket. Still with the fork in our mouth as the waitress wanted to take the dishes away from us. We therefore expressed our dissatisfaction by validating the minimum amount on the payment terminal when paying the bill."
"If you like Chinese cuisine and don't care about the ambience, you should definitely eat here.

Absolutely recommendable value for money."
"It's inside the Bellagio, in a somewhat hidden location in the middle of the casino. Well decorated and comfortable house. We ordered tempura, yaki noodles and a Kung Po shrimp, as an option from the menu of the day. We found it to be OK overall, with reasonable service and the same prices."
