review
"My husband had eaten at a PF Chang’s in a different state on a business trip, but I have never eaten at one, so we decided to try it. There weren’t any tables open when we arrived at 10 pm, but the wait was only 15 minutes and they texted us to let us know our table was ready (I love technology). 
Alex was our server. He was very friendly, professional, and attentive to our needs.
The atmosphere was very dark, with our table only lit up by candlelight. My husband joked that it was so we couldn’t see the food. While that probably wasn’t the actual reason, we really could barely see what we were eating. We ordered sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, and fried rice, which ended up being quite a bit too much for us to finish. But, it was all very good.
My only complaint was the size of the table we were put at. There was barely room for our two dinner plates, let alone the serving dishes of food and the two sides of rice. We ended up dishing up all of the beef with broccoli right away, so that they could take away a plate, making it a little less chaotic, but not much better.
I would eat here again, but would hope for a table a bit bigger and maybe in a lighter part of the restaurant."
"It can be hard to find something nice but reasonably priced on the Strip. This was both! Entrees were mostly around $17-19 for what we were looking for and then with fried rice we ended up around $45 for the two of us. Food was outstanding, service was really good, portions were good size, nice atmosphere, and steps from the craziness of the Strip. We went around 7 PM on the Sunday of Memorial Day and we had about a 30 Minute wait. 
We would definitely go back!"
"Located at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. They did a fantastic remodel. My wife and I dined here for dinner with an 8pm reservation and were seated promptly. My wife started with a Singapore Sling. We shared 3 dishes. The Mandarin Crunch Salad, Pepper Steak, and Kung Pao Chicken. The prices are a little high, but the portions are bigger than pre-remodel. The white/brown rice is now free with an entree, I think we used to have to pay for a side of rice. Service was excellent and management should be proud. I will return very soon."
"This meal started out decent with appetizers egg roll, dumplings , and shrimp were good, and great service to start.
The beef and broccoli was good but the orange chicken was soggy, and too big chewy pieces. It was not good. 
The plate of noodles the dishes come with are over the top tasteless and boring-throw a vegetable at the noodles , sauce or something but that was just not worth eating. Our waiter seemed to forget us and wasn’t consistent, wanted to order dessert but didn’t want another long wait. 
Overall disappointed!"
"Everything went well but I was a little disappointed that we were there to celebrate my birthday (noted on our reservation along with gluten and dairy free) and there was not acknowledgement of anything.  When were there for my last birthday celebration I received a small birthday dessert (gluten free) and was offered a gluten free menu.

This time the service was basically only going through the motions."
"Visited while in Vegas on a busy evening. Got a table immediately which was great. Cocktails were delivered swiftly which were needed after a busy afternoon shopping! Food was quick to be delivered, huge portions and piping hot. Our waiter although polite was not that friendly and maybe a little rushed. That won't put me off, the foods to good!"
"We love eating at PF Changs, family style. Order for the table and share and with such reasonable prices you can easily order a few dishes to all taste and share.
Good food, good portions, good price good service,  nice atmosphere. 
The banana spring rolls for dessert are amazing 
By only criticism is that post Covid you don't get a menu, it's all online unless you ask for a printed menu and the selection has been reduced.  So some of our favourite dishes are no longer available"
"My wife and I made a reservation for 8:15pm and were seated immediately. Our waiter Derrick showed up within 5 minutes and took a cocktail order for a Chang's Mai Tai and we also ordered the Calamari for an appetizer. 

Never saw Derrick again until 8:50pm. The Mai Tai sat at the bar for 30 minutes (with the ice melting). When we said where is our drink and Calamari he said ""I gotcha"" in a very sarcastic voice.

Because Derrick was gone for so long we never had a chance to order our main dishes. (The bill would have been over $100) We asked for the check, paid and left.  ""I gotcha"" - I will NEVER return!

I have given this restaurant very positive reviews in the past."
"My husband and I are vacationing in Las Vegas and are staying at Hilton Grand Vacations Club-ELARA, April 29-May 3, 2021!  This is our first trip, since COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020!

We stopped here for drinks and appetizer on 04/29/21! The service started out friendly, but was lacking when it came to ordering our drinks and appetizer.  When I told the taller female that I was ready to order and before I could tell her when she is available to take my order she held her hand up to me as if to tell me to stop and she said she will be a minute.  She then gave a customer a menus and then took his drink order. After receiving our food the bar staff did not check on us. My alcoholic beverage (can’t remember the name) was not filled to the top and lacked being dressed on the rim!  We had to ask the server questions. We felt the staff were more focused on others. There was more of a conversation by the male bar staff with us when it came to us getting ready to pay for our meal. The service was less than average which generally is not what we have experienced at a P.F. Chang’s establishments. 

This review is based on the service and not the food! The Dynamite Roll was one of the best rolls we have had. The smoke flavor is what put it over the top! We would had ordered another roll if the service was not so poor!"
"My wife and I decided to go to PF Chang after having visited the chains other restaurants in Dubai and London, quite frankly we were left extremely disappointed. We was allowed to be left to wait for about 3-4 minutes before we was acknowledged at the door and then was served by a young lady who showed no enthusiasm whatsoever. The restaurant was extremely quiet yet they decided to put us next to the stairs which we found surprising. A waiter came to take our drinks order and we was not ready to order so asked for 5 minutes and the attitude we received was so poor that we we decided to walk out and eat some place else! We love PF Chang food but was not meant to be this time round :("
"My wife and I went here expecting the usual good quality and previously good service but were very disappointed on both counts.  I was told over the phone when we made our reservation that I could use my Caesars Rewards credits at this location on a 1 for 1 basis since we were staying at a Caesars property (Bally's).  No.  They charge 2-for-1.

Service by primary server was horrible.   No settings at table, had to ask.  After food came, the beef in the beef and broccoli dish was a bit tough so we asked for knives.  Never came.  Tore apart the beef with our chopsticks and fork.

We were offered a free dessert but we just wanted to get out of there, especially with a vagrant standing just outside our eating area (we ate outside) screaming at us for some unknown reason.  No attempt by staff to shoo him away.  We paid with cash just so we could get out of there.

This was the worst experience of our 3-day L.V. stay.  Will NOT go back."
"It may be a chain, but it's a decent one. This location is very convenient directly across from Bellagio. The service was good and friendly, they refilled our sodas 3x and kept up with our voracious consumption of soda. Food was excellent on this visit, especially a succulent kung pao shrimp. Reservations seem to be needed even on nights or times you wouldnt' expect it to be busy, so we walked in and then reserved onsite, our table was not ready for an hour or so - book ahead if you can."
"Seated quickly and served by the wonderfully helpful and talented Brian, our first dining experience in Vegas was lovely. Food portions were huge even though we only had ‘Lunch’ sized. 

Would happily come back."
"We were seated immediately and there were only four other tables out of about fifteen filled in our area.  But no one came to check on us or take our order.  Should have left.  The preset plate was gross (food not cleaned off from a prior diner) and there were two hairs rolled up inside of one of the napkins.  I ordered won ton soup.  It was not hot and the won tons were “doughy” and seemed uncooked.  I sent them back for the waiter to return and tell me the “chef” said that’s what they are supposed to taste like.  I let them keep the won ton soup.  The waiter offered a desert as a substitute, but I am diabetic.  The music in our both added to the issues.   Very loud in our booth.  Lots of strange loud sounds with heavy drums.  Way too loud to creat a soothing environment.  Seemed to make a tense situation even worse.   Amazing if food warmers who call themselves chefs get to dictate their inedible tastes.  I’ve been to many other PF Changs.   This was by far the worst.  No wonder this one was so empty when there were long lines most every where else."
"We'd seen PF Chang's mentioned in many tv shows and movies, so wanted to see what it was all about. The fact we love Asian food also played a small part in this.....

This venue is accessible directly from the strip and inside the Planet Hollywood Resort. 

Service was good and the restaurant was clean. It was getting busier during our visit but it didn't seem to affect service. There was a minor delay in getting one drink and for this we received a proactive apology  - which makes such a welcome change from just about anywhere else we have ever been.

Prices appeared lower than elsewhere on the strip and the portion sizes were very generous. Food was very hot and tasty. We had two starters and two lunch bowls and would probably have the same choices again.

Really happy with this meal. Will go to another one if I come across one in the future."
"Located in the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. My wife and I dined here for dinner with a reservation. We shared everything. We started with the  Wok-charred Brussels sprouts with peanuts, chili pods, Kung Pao sauce. We also had the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and the Pork Dumplings. The food was excellent and came out fast. After the meal it took 25+ minutes to get the check and pay. I guess the waitress was not concerned with a 2-Top, when she had larger tables. Management needs to fix the time it takes to pay. I will return for the very good food."
"Our dinner started well, with delicious starters which  filled us with positive anticipation for the main courses. The two people who had the ribs said they were superb and the chicken and veggie lettuce cups were nice. 
However when the mains arrived you’d have thought we were in a different restaurant. My husband’s Singapore noodles dish was virtually inedible as they were covered in grease. 
We told the waiter and his response was “oh yes I’ve had people say that before.”
My Bhudda bowl tasted of absolutely nothing, vegetables in a brown watery sauce and the orange chicken ordered by our friends was also very poor.
The waiter - Dylan - was very pleasant but very pushy. There’s really no need to come back every two minutes asking us if everything is ok - and then do nothing when you tell him it isn’t.
What was also really annoying was taking plates away when people were still eating without asking if they were done with. 
Overall a very poor experience. Our first and last time at PF Chang"
I have been here before heading out for the evening but my favourite time to go is after my evening events. It is a great way to end the night with great food and a cocktail. Staff is very friendly and attentive and the menu has a lot of great food options. I have not been disappointed by anything as this restaurant!
"When arriving we were told it would be a 20-30 min wait. Then after we were not contacted for 40 min the staff kept stringing us along saying it would only be another 10 min. Finally, after an hour I inquired as to how much longer it would be, and they told us at least another 30 min. We had one night in Vegas and our dinner plans were ruined by this restaurant. If they would have been honest with us up front we could have gone elsewhere for dinner. As it was, we ended up getting fast food and taking it back to our hotel room. I have been a customer of PF Chang's for many years and have always been highly satisfied with their service and food, but tonight was a highly disappointing experience."
"I have been to this restaurant a few times during my past visits and always impressed with the service and food quality.

The ambiance has changed in the last few years but its pretty decent.

We went there for lunch and dinner and the service remains excellent on both occasions.

We ordered the kung pao shrimp bowl and singapore sreet noodles for lunch. For dinner it was korean glass noodles. Fantastic food overall.

Definitely worth a visit."
"I can remember when PF Chang's was very good, but our experience was anything but.  After waiting 10-25 minutes we had to track down our server (Steve) to get water and menus. We were seated by a window which was dirty, as we're the window sills (dead bugs and deep dust). Our food (spring rolls, spicy tuna roll, and kung pow shrimp) was mediocre at best. I had to ask for more water, which was never served after a 15-minute wait. Very disappointing."
"We were looking forward a delicious dinner experience based on reviews, location and cost. We were disappointed in the whole experience including the interior ambience which is not inviting, dark and needing a total revamp. The food was not appetising which was more of an issue. We ordered the flagship lettuce wrap appetiser and sent it back. At first we thought we had grit in the food because rock hard particles were in each mouthful and we were fearful of damaging our teeth. Turns out is was uncooked sections of the accompanying rice noodles. My entree was a dish of chilli hot prawns. This was a boring dish containing prawns cooked in a very sticky sauce. I ate only half as it wasn’t enjoyable. My wife had sliced beef and broccoli and she found the flank steak somewhat tough. We make this at home to their recipe with flank steak from Costco and our home cooked version is significantly better. A poor experience hence our review as so many Las Vegas restaurants are serving much poorer food than pre-COVID and need to improve."
"We love PF Changs and stop every time we are in Vegas. We know the portions are large, and while we were trying to decide, our server Tabitha came over with some great suggestions about our order. Instead of sharing one dish, we decided to go with individual lunch bowls with egg drop soup. It was the perfect portion, and we greatly enjoyed them. We appreciated Tabitha's help, especially when I accidentally left my card on the tray. The entire staff handled that in a very professional manner when I went back to pick it up."
"Having visited Las Vegas before, I really wanted a different place to visit. This was a find but well worth it. Having walked for around 20 minutes I came across this place. Having visited Vegas in the peak of January’s technology show this place was busy but not full. The staff here are really friendly and I asked for a recommendation. My server suggested the Mongolian Beef. He said it’s a favourite and is a decent portion, he was not wrong. Overall a really nice meal and well worth a visit. For reference, the images show food on my plate but it came on bowls."
"We usually try to get some quick eats in Chinese cuisine when we come down to Vegas. Pf changes has been a stable choice for us for years.
This is our first time since for pandemic and I find the quality has gone down hill. We ordered ginger chicken and broccoli, Buddha’s feast extra cooked, chicken lo mein and chicken pad Thai. We found the noodle dishes were lacking. Chicken overcooked dry and crusty at times. Noodles just stirred. The Buddha’s feast was not well cooked as ordered - broccoli rarely cooked very crunchy. Flavours were lacking too. A bit disappointing as pf Chang was consistently good in the past."
"We love PF Chang’s. We arrived mid-evening, we were promptly seated at the bar and the service was superb. We shared the vegetable spring rolls which were exceptional as always, and we had the Mongolian Beef and Sweet & Sour Pork for mains - everything was perfectly cooked, presented and served. Attentive bar staff serving a great range of beers and wines, there’s a reason we visit every time we’re in Vegas."
Really impressed with dinner here the staff were so attentive from the booking to the end of the meal. It was busy and they advised there was a 40 min wait but got texted in 10 minutes. The server was so friendly and all the appetizers and mains came out very quickly. The server was also knowledgeable on the wine too which was great. Food portions were generous and we had to take some home. Great ambiance and loved the evening lighting.
We are so incredibly happy to enjoy P.F. Changs at the Planet Hollywood.  We live in Las Vegas and last visited the location in Town Square . Many times we experienced the restaurant on the corner of Paradise and Flamingo and spent our daughters wedding reception there enjoying everything.  This location has closed and the Town Square location has opened . How disappointed we were with our visit to that location.  In hopes of experiencing P.F Changs in our past memories we again visited this location at the Planet Hollywood.....Bravo to all . Everything was Superb.  Just as we remembered it to be. Food ...Cocktails..Service...Bravo .
My wife and I dined here for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated immediately. We shared everything. Dinner started out with an appetizer of Crispy Green Beans with spicy dipping sauce. The two entrees we ordered were Beef and Broccoli and Shrimp in Lobster Sauce with white rice. All three dishes were excellent and we would order them again. Service was great. Management should be proud.
"Fantastic experience and well worth the visit! We have eaten in the London and Las Vegas restaurants and they are both fantastic. In the Las Vegas one we were served by Francisco and he was FANTASTIC, we were both impressed by the food and the setting. Would definitely recommend this place"

"First time here and ended up returning 2 days later. Food was delicious although service was spotty. Calamari was great, so was firecracker shrimp. Spring rolls and pork fried egg rolls also very good. Szechuan chicken was delicious, chicken pad Thai Kai good but portion was so big and by then I had eaten too much. Dipping sauces for all food were great. Prices extremely reasonable. I will definitely visit here again whether in Vegas or anywhere else. Yum!"
"Fancied something different in las Vegas so come here for a meal, was very busy but once we were seated it was fine, food was ok but the service was awful, our waitress just couldn't be bothered with us"
"I recently hosted a group of 14 at PF Chang in Planet Hollywood and I simply can't say enough good things about our experience!!! We had a pre-set menu and the food came to us timely, hot and delicious...everyone raved about how good it tasted.  The service was impeccable...we had one primary waiter and he saw to our needs, handled any requests we had quickly and professionally and in general, was a pleasure to work with.  What I also appreciated is that the restaurant did NOT attempt to upsell us for more than we had contracted for...frankly, a rarity in Vegas."
Dave’s our waiter was fantastic! So friendly and accommodating. Even listening to him with other tables he’s really top notch! Been to PF changs several times lettuce wraps never disappoint
"We had lunch here as our first meal shortly after arriving in Vegas.  The quality of meat and the meals were very good.  We loved all of the food we ordered which included the Mongolian beef, calamari, Kung Pao shrimp, and chow mein.  Servers were very attentive.  Great visit!"
"PF Changs is always consistently good. This location holds up the brand value really well. In Planet Hollywood and overlooking the strip, the atmosphere is very good. I had Chang’s spicy chicken yesterday and it was excellent. I recommend."
"I am not a fan of this chain and my local franchise is not on my favorites list.. We went there because were arrived in LV late and it was in our hotel. BUT this location was exception in all respects, best meal I had in Las Vegas and top notch service from Dylan."
"We'd seen PF Chang's mentioned in many tv shows and movies, so wanted to see what it was all about. The fact we love Asian food also played a small part in this.....

We had a great meal and excellent service.  We had several apps including their dumplings and lettuce cups.  The entrees were delicious and our server was very attentive.
Recommend the won ton soup and vegetable low mein. Service was great and the food was just what was needed on a cold day
"Went with family. You need to book in the evening. We didn’t and we’re sent away for a while. They then text and said our table was ready.
Service was very good and the food was delicious and plenty to eat.
Would return."
"Wide variety of excellent Chinese food
Hot and spicy soup always a must. Spring rolls alone worth the trip

Portions ample best to share entries"

"This was my second time to this chain restaurant and first time in Las Vegas where it is located in the Planet Hollywood casino. My prior experience was in 8 years ago Houston (2014) which I recall as average with poor service. They have a very large bar downstairs and a lot of tables upstairs with a small working bar.
Drinks included Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc ($21- 9 ounces), Josh Merlot ($17 – 9 ounces), Rising Dragon ($16) and Green Tea ($6).

Our order included two cups ($8 / each) and two bowls ($13 each) of Wonton soup - Savory broth, house-made pork wontons, shrimp, chicken, fried rice ($5), Mongolian beef ($28) - Sweet soy glaze, garlic, and snipped green onion, Pepper Steak ($24) - Pepper-garlic sauce, flank steak, onion, bell pepper, and two Beef with Broccoli ($48 / two) - Flank steak, ginger-garlic aromatics, green onion, steamed broccoli.

What I liked:
-	The Won Ton soup may have been the best I have ever had. The broth was darker than most, and full of great ingredients and flavor.
-	The beef in the Mongolian beef was very tender

What I Did Not Like:
-	There was an extended wait time to be seated even though there were a lot of empty tables
-	The lighting was very dim
-	Service was inattentive
-	It took a really long time to get our drinks
-	I was never asked if I needed a refill of my green tea
-	There were too many scallions in the Mongolian beef
-	The Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc price per glass was around 2.25x value where 3x retail is fair value and 5x retail is very good value. The Jos Merlot was 2.75x retail value.
-	 The price points for the food were higher than I would have expected for what we got

Based on this visit, I would consider dining at a PF Chang’s in the future."
"We prebooked a table for 10. On arrival, another group had occupied our table and we were asked to take a high top table at the bar. This wasn’t satisfactory for us due to specifically booking 4 weeks in advance for a normal table. 
Staff didn’t really handle the situation well and quite frankly should have moved the people they’d mis-seated. 
Eventually we were seated after having a couple drinks at the bar waiting. 
The food is always delicious and one of our favourites to visit."
"We went to this location after a great show in Las Vegas.  The food and the service was fantastic.  We had a couple of appetizers and the food was fresh, hot and delicious.  Our waitress, Sadie was fantastic and very attentive.  I would recommend this restaurant while in Vegas."
"This is not a place for people with any food allergies. They are unwilling/unable to make any substitutions. 

Despite that, the few things I could eat were decent. Nothing exceptional, but good. Our server was excellent and my favorite part of eating there."
Food was okay- definitely nothing special - first time- hoped for more - skip this restaurant- grad to guy fiere or Gordon Ramsey
I went to Vegas for the first time for a girls trip and we frequent our PF Changs at home so it was a must to eat there on the strip. It was totally worth it. The food was as good as always but the real star of the meal was our server. Michael was so accommodating and kind during our whole meal. He was very helpful with recommendations on what to do while here in Vegas. He made us laugh and made our dinner a 10/10. If your going to Vegas Changs hopefully you get him as your server.
"We were looking forward a delicious dinner experience based on reviews, location and cost.

"Efficient, friendly service, nice atmosphere & superb food!
Would definitely recommend this eatery.  Great for couples or groups!"
We ate here while visiting Vegas for a couple nights at the end of our 10 day western vacation.   Very reliable food and service on par with other PF Changs we have visited.   You can make reservations at this location which is a plus.   Slightly elevated prices but not bad compared to other restaurants in Vegas.   Only negative is that bathrooms are located out the inside door in the casino and the condition of the bathrooms was nasty.
"Food was luke warm
, we sent it back , waited a long time , still luke warm. We needed all the hot sauces and condiments to make our meal interesting"
"Our dinner started well, with delicious starters which  filled us with positive anticipation for the main courses. The two people who had the ribs said they were superb and the chicken and veggie lettuce cups were nice.

Overall a very poor experience. Our first and last time at PF Chang"
"Being from Canada where we don't have PF Changs, this is a nice treat for us. Perfect service, all dishes flavourful, hot and delicious. Must try lettuce wraps!!!!"
"As stated, this was our second visit to this chain. Our first was in El Paso, Tx. 
This location was in the Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. It was convenient for us after traveling most of the day. 
After a short wait, we were seated and immediately Jennifer, our cutie server, was effervescent and had a bubbly personality. She took our drink and appetizer order. 
Appetizers were huge. As were the dinner order. I don’t recall the El Paso location being that big. Had leftovers for breakfast the next day. Decor was great. Only problem was we were seated next to the staircase and I was afraid people would think I was looking up the skirts of women coming down the stairs. I didn’t. 
But Jennifer made the experience great."
"My wife and I had dinner here. Place was absolutely  packed - typical Vegas. Food was very good as usual. We eate at the Fairfax, Va location often. Service was slow, but understandable since this was Vegas."
"We were seated immediately and there were only four other tables out of about fifteen filled in our area.  But no one came to check on us or take our order.  Should have left.  The preset plate was gross (food not cleaned off from a prior diner) and there were two hairs rolled up inside of one of the napkins.  I ordered won ton soup.

Amazing if food warmers who call themselves chefs get to dictate their inedible tastes.  I’ve been to many other PF Changs.   This was by far the worst.  No wonder this one was so empty when there were long lines most every where else."
"would definitely recommend the spare ribs, kung pao chicken and mongolian beef.  
fromt of house again seemed a bit disinterested but the servers were great and would definitely be back if we are ever back in vegas again"
"Really tasty food with good sized portions so a main and a noodle dish was easily enough for the 2 of us. The lo mein noodle dish was really good and in fact the whole experience was excellent so pretty sure we will return before leaving vegas. We chanced a walk in and whilst there were no tables, dinner at the bar was good and provided entertainment watching the barman craft cocktails.
Service was very quick and would definitely recommend."
"We went to Las Vegas for the first time in May 2022 and had a great time - except for when we went to PF Chang's. We love the restaurant - which is why we went there. But then we met Jen. 

She came to our table without anything in hand. We didn't ask any questions because she may be one of those super waitress who remembers everything - but no, she was the total opposite. We asked for a Malibu Baybreeze extra sweet with little ice - she came back with 100% pure rum with no ice!!! We also asked for a virgin Pina Colada. She came back with a spiked drink - you could smell the alcohol in the drink BEFORE she got to the table.

Then we order three entrees for our meal. Thanks to Jen, the third one showed up right before we left - 50 minutes later!!! Why she even has a job is beyond me. But I'm not here for name calling. I just want to share our experience and make sure that the next person doesn't go through the same thing as us. If the waitress says her name is Jen, make sure that you ask the manager for another server!!!"
The food was great as always. We sat at a table with a view of the outside and  enjoyed the view. Our waitress could have been better. She never checked to see if we needed anything.
"We like PF Chang so we ate, and this location did not disappoint. We had soup, lettuce wraps, orange chicken, egg rolls - all were yummy. Great service as well."
This restaurant inside Planet Hollywood is so good.  We recommend the chicken fried rice---the best!  Service is always excellent when eating at the bar.
I use to love to come here before pandemic now the quality is terrible. I had my old favorite fried rice but now it's like prison fried rice. So disappointing.
"When arriving we were told it would be a 20-30 min wait. Then after we were not contacted for 40 min the staff kept stringing us along saying it would only be another 10 min. Finally, after an hour I inquired as to how much longer it would be, and they told us at least another 30 min. We had one night in Vegas and our dinner plans were ruined by this restaurant. If they would have been honest with us up front we could have gone elsewhere for dinner. As it was, we ended up getting fast food and taking it back to our hotel room. I have been a customer of PF Chang's for many years and have always been highly satisfied with their service and food, but tonight was a highly disappointing experience."
"I have been to this restaurant a few times during my past visits and always impressed with the service and food quality.

The ambiance has changed in the last few years but its pretty decent.

We went there for lunch and dinner and the service remains excellent on both occasions.

We ordered the kung pao shrimp bowl and singapore sreet noodles for lunch. For dinner it was korean glass noodles. Fantastic food overall.

Definitely worth a visit."
We’ve always been a fan of PF Chang’s having tried the food all over the world (well Dubai and most of the US). We last ate here in 2018 where the food was fabulous. Roll on 2022 and what happened? Great service but we ordered a Kung Pao and Sesame Chicken which just made tasted bland and no way to the standards we have been previously used too.
"We love eating at PF Changs, family style. Order for the table and share and with such reasonable prices you can easily order a few dishes to all taste and share.
Good food, good portions, good price good service,  nice atmosphere. 
The banana spring rolls for dessert are amazing 
By only criticism is that post Covid you don't get a menu, it's all online unless you ask for a printed menu and the selection has been reduced.  So some of our favourite dishes are no longer available"
"Went here following the reviews and have to say wasn’t disappointed. Lovely food and attentive staff, would highly recommend!"
"My wife and I went here expecting the usual good quality and previously good service but were very disappointed on both counts.  I was told over the phone when we made our reservation that I could use my Caesars Rewards credits at this location on a 1 for 1 basis since we were staying at a Caesars property (Bally's).  No.  They charge 2-for-1.

Service by primary server was horrible.   No settings at table, had to ask.  After food came, the beef in the beef and broccoli dish was a bit tough so we asked for knives.  Never came.  Tore apart the beef with our chopsticks and fork.

We were offered a free dessert but we just wanted to get out of there, especially with a vagrant standing just outside our eating area (we ate outside) screaming at us for some unknown reason.  No attempt by staff to shoo him away.  We paid with cash just so we could get out of there.

This was the worst experience of our 3-day L.V. stay.  Will NOT go back."
We always eat here when in Vegas.  The food is consistently delicious.  We ate at the bar and had excellent service.
"My wife and I made a reservation for 8:15pm and were seated immediately. Our waiter Derrick showed up within 5 minutes and took a cocktail order for a Chang's Mai Tai and we also ordered the Calamari for an appetizer. 

Never saw Derrick again until 8:50pm. The Mai Tai sat at the bar for 30 minutes (with the ice melting). When we said where is our drink and Calamari he said ""I gotcha"" in a very sarcastic voice.

Because Derrick was gone for so long we never had a chance to order our main dishes. (The bill would have been over $100) We asked for the check, paid and left.  ""I gotcha"" - I will NEVER return!

I have given this restaurant very positive reviews in the past."
"There is a very good bar menu for craft cocktails and wines to match any dish ordered. The sushi rolls were very fresh, nicely presented and substantial. We enjoyed the Battle of the Seas Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll--all were excellent. 
Our server, Samuel took very good care of us."
"Fantastic experience and well worth the visit! We have eaten in the London and Las Vegas restaurants and they are both fantastic. In the Las Vegas one we were served by Francisco and he was FANTASTIC, we were both impressed by the food and the setting. Would definitely recommend this place"
Located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. My wife and I made a 8:15pm reservation and were seated immediately. We shared the Shrimpin Lobster Sauce and the Beef and Broccoli. Large portions and very good service. I will return again soon. Many photos added.
P. F. CHANGS is overpriced for what you get.  The portions are small.  The service was good but a lot of different people were coming and going.  I accidentally dropped my wine glass and they would have charged me for another glass.
My wife and I enjoyed our experience here. The food was delicious. We tried numerous cocktails from their drink menu and absolutely loved each one. Great place w great service
"Wife and I ate here and really enjoyed the food & drinks. Our waitress, Daisy, was outstanding!! Cocktails were around $10 and tasted good. Their food is tasty and fairly priced."
My wife and I dined here for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated immediately. We shared everything. Dinner started out with an appetizer of Crispy Green Beans with spicy dipping sauce. The two entrees we ordered were Beef and Broccoli and Shrimp in Lobster Sauce with white rice. All three dishes were excellent and we would order them again. Service was great. Management should be proud.
"The place in conveniently located in PH. They have plenty of seating on two floors. The bad part is there is no elevator only stairs for the second floor.
The food is good and the portion size is good."
"Walked up with no dinner reservation and had a short wait for a table. Started our meal with the chicken lettuce wraps, these were excellent. We ordered the fried rice plates with beef and with chicken. The fried rice plates were good, but not as good as our local Japanese steakhouse. Service was a little slow do to being understaffed."
"If you want Americanized Chain Chinese Food then this is a decent choice. They are far from authentic Chinese Food, not even close."
We ate at the upstairs bar where Jason was our bartender/server. He did an amazing job. The food was excellent.  I really like the Singapore sheet noodles.
"This meal started out decent with appetizers egg roll, dumplings , and shrimp were good, and great service to start.
The beef and broccoli was good but the orange chicken was soggy, and too big chewy pieces. It was not good. 
The plate of noodles the dishes come with are over the top tasteless and boring-throw a vegetable at the noodles , sauce or something but that was just not worth eating. Our waiter seemed to forget us and wasn’t consistent, wanted to order dessert but didn’t want another long wait. 
Overall disappointed!"
"Located in the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. My wife and I dined here for dinner with a reservation. We shared everything. We started with the  Wok-charred Brussels sprouts with peanuts, chili pods, Kung Pao sauce. We also had the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and the Pork Dumplings. The food was excellent and came out fast. After the meal it took 25+ minutes to get the check and pay. I guess the waitress was not concerned with a 2-Top, when she had larger tables. Management needs to fix the time it takes to pay. I will return for the very good food."
"My husband had eaten at a PF Chang’s in a different state on a business trip, but I have never eaten at one, so we decided to try it. There weren’t any tables open when we arrived at 10 pm, but the wait was only 15 minutes and they texted us to let us know our table was ready (I love technology). 
Alex was our server. He was very friendly, professional, and attentive to our needs.
The atmosphere was very dark, with our table only lit up by candlelight. My husband joked that it was so we couldn’t see the food. While that probably wasn’t the actual reason, we really could barely see what we were eating. We ordered sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, and fried rice, which ended up being quite a bit too much for us to finish. But, it was all very good.
My only complaint was the size of the table we were put at. There was barely room for our two dinner plates, let alone the serving dishes of food and the two sides of rice. We ended up dishing up all of the beef with broccoli right away, so that they could take away a plate, making it a little less chaotic, but not much better.
I would eat here again, but would hope for a table a bit bigger and maybe in a lighter part of the restaurant."
"I ate all over the strip, with lots of slow service everywhere, but not here! The best food and fastest service was at my own hotel at Planet Hollywood. California roll and margarita, very good. Waitress was super pleasant!"
"Located at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. My wife and I made reservations for 8pm and were seated immediately. Good thing, because there was a one hour wait without reservations. My wife had the Tempura Calamari and Vegetables. I had the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. YUM! The portions were very large and the service on this visit was excellent. I added many photos of our visit and will return again soon."
"It may be a chain, but it's a decent one. This location is very convenient directly across from Bellagio. The service was good and friendly, they refilled our sodas 3x and kept up with our voracious consumption of soda. Food was excellent on this visit, especially a succulent kung pao shrimp. Reservations seem to be needed even on nights or times you wouldnt' expect it to be busy, so we walked in and then reserved onsite, our table was not ready for an hour or so - book ahead if you can."
"During the pandemic, when PH was closed, PF Chang's did a complete remodel.  It is very nice inside.  We enjoyed eating at the bar but miss Happy Hour.  Service was great!"
"It can be hard to find something nice but reasonably priced on the Strip. This was both! Entrees were mostly around $17-19 for what we were looking for and then with fried rice we ended up around $45 for the two of us. Food was outstanding, service was really good, portions were good size, nice atmosphere, and steps from the craziness of the Strip. We went around 7 PM on the Sunday of Memorial Day and we had about a 30 Minute wait. 
We would definitely go back!"
"My wife is a vegetarian and there are not a lot of vegetable dishes, so we both ordered eggplant and it was undercooked and  not prepared like  we have had at other PF Changs.  Dessert was good and the service was excellent."
"My husband and I are vacationing in Las Vegas and are staying at Hilton Grand Vacations Club-ELARA, April 29-May 3, 2021!  This is our first trip, since COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020!

We stopped here for drinks and appetizer on 04/29/21! The service started out friendly, but was lacking when it came to ordering our drinks and appetizer.  When I told the taller female that I was ready to order and before I could tell her when she is available to take my order she held her hand up to me as if to tell me to stop and she said she will be a minute.  She then gave a customer a menus and then took his drink order. After receiving our food the bar staff did not check on us. My alcoholic beverage (can’t remember the name) was not filled to the top and lacked being dressed on the rim!  We had to ask the server questions. We felt the staff were more focused on others. There was more of a conversation by the male bar staff with us when it came to us getting ready to pay for our meal. The service was less than average which generally is not what we have experienced at a P.F. Chang’s establishments. 

This review is based on the service and not the food! The Dynamite Roll was one of the best rolls we have had. The smoke flavor is what put it over the top! We would had ordered another roll if the service was not so poor!"
"Located at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. They did a fantastic remodel. My wife and I dined here for dinner with an 8pm reservation and were seated promptly. My wife started with a Singapore Sling. We shared 3 dishes. The Mandarin Crunch Salad, Pepper Steak, and Kung Pao Chicken. The prices are a little high, but the portions are bigger than pre-remodel. The white/brown rice is now free with an entree, I think we used to have to pay for a side of rice. Service was excellent and management should be proud. I will return very soon."
Christian is an amazing waiter!! The food is great and they’re quick. We went there twice during the 4 days we were in town.  Newly remodeled right inside Planet Hollywood.
"We were in Vegas for a birthday with a large group. We got a private room upstairs which was really cool. All the food was amazing, the service was top notch. Must try the Old Fashioned and the Fire and Ice — A+ presentation. Can’t wait to come back"
This trip was excellent. Planet Hollywood is always a great place to stay. I happen to enjoy gaming. Miracle Mile shops are also great.. I was in Vegas as a fan for the Oregon Lady Ducks in the PAC-12 NCAA basketball tournament. Icing on the cake WE WON!!!
"We visit Planet Hollywood a couple of times each year for a nice couples getaway.  We look forward to a dinner at P.F. Chang's each visit.  Once again had a great meal.  The food is consistently delicious and well prepared.  Our server was outstanding as usual.  Good value, nice ambience, great evening."
It was wonderful. Way to much food though. Services was good. They were quick and very kind. And guy was lots of fun
We are so incredibly happy to enjoy P.F. Changs at the Planet Hollywood.  We live in Las Vegas and last visited the location in Town Square . Many times we experienced the restaurant on the corner of Paradise and Flamingo and spent our daughters wedding reception there enjoying everything.  This location has closed and the Town Square location has opened . How disappointed we were with our visit to that location.  In hopes of experiencing P.F Changs in our past memories we again visited this location at the Planet Hollywood.....Bravo to all . Everything was Superb.  Just as we remembered it to be. Food ...Cocktails..Service...Bravo .
I have been here before heading out for the evening but my favourite time to go is after my evening events. It is a great way to end the night with great food and a cocktail. Staff is very friendly and attentive and the menu has a lot of great food options. I have not been disappointed by anything as this restaurant!
P.F. Chang's is a brilliant restaurant. Food is lovely and lots of it. Staff are brilliant and very knowledgeable.
"Everything went well but I was a little disappointed that we were there to celebrate my birthday (noted on our reservation along with gluten and dairy free) and there was not acknowledgement of anything.  When were there for my last birthday celebration I received a small birthday dessert (gluten free) and was offered a gluten free menu.

This time the service was basically only going through the motions."
"Seated quickly and served by the wonderfully helpful and talented Brian, our first dining experience in Vegas was lovely. Food portions were huge even though we only had ‘Lunch’ sized. 

Would happily come back."
"We always eat in the bar at happy hour.  They have such good deals.  The service is great, and the food is consisently excellent."
"Understands our alcohol and dietary needs - the cook came out, they are are happy we are here. 👍 So far the experience has been great! Sushi and tea with veggie entre' on the way!!"
"Visited while in Vegas on a busy evening. Got a table immediately which was great. Cocktails were delivered swiftly which were needed after a busy afternoon shopping! Food was quick to be delivered, huge portions and piping hot. Our waiter although polite was not that friendly and maybe a little rushed. That won't put me off, the foods to good!"
"If you like Chinese food this is a great choice, they have the dynamite lettuce wraps and the dumplings are good too. I also tried their Kung Pow chicken which was good."
"It’s gonna be a wait but they text you when your table is ready. Food is big portions and very tasty. Try the Brussels sprouts, it’s like candy. Service was very friendly."
"We always visit a PF Chang's when we travel, it's our favourite restaurant.

We ate here one evening and it wasn't too busy. Our server (Cameron I think) was great, very friendly.

We shared the lettuce wraps and the honey chicken. All delicious!"
"Great ambiance , great value and more important great food . My daughter would also recomend the cocktails ."
Taste of food is absolutely good and no doubt the service and hosting staff are also remarkable. One item in menu is enough for one person.
"Having visited Las Vegas before, I really wanted a different place to visit. This was a find but well worth it. Having walked for around 20 minutes I came across this place. Having visited Vegas in the peak of January’s technology show this place was busy but not full. The staff here are really friendly and I asked for a recommendation. My server suggested the Mongolian Beef. He said it’s a favourite and is a decent portion, he was not wrong. Overall a really nice meal and well worth a visit. For reference, the images show food on my plate but it came on bowls."
"The food was great as always but even though the restaurant was slow when we got there it took almost 10 minutes fore we saw a server at our table, he was 3 feet away when we got there but never acknowledged us, after we order and got things started his servic was good, but the initial wait put a damper on our experience"
"My mom had never been to a PF Chang's and we were staying at Planet Hollywood so we decided to have dinner here one night. We ordered the Salmon and beef and broccoli with fried rice.. both were good but the Salmon was excellent! 

I accidentally dropped my drink (I was not drunk nor had I been drinking alcohol) anyways my glass slipped out of my hand and I ended up wearing my beverage and of course got some on the floor.. it was horribly embarrassing. Our waiter was so sweet about it, he never made me feel bad or worse than I already felt and they replaced my drink.. I WAS BEYOND APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR KINDNESS."
"Personally I feel the PF Changs in Northbrook, IL is better than this one in Vegas. There are many better choices to make."
Ate at the bar and ordered the tuna roll and Ahi Poke bowl.  The poke had frozen mangos in it and they were so cold!!  Wine was  $11 for a large pour.  The server was friendly but a bit slow.
"Thank goodness PF Changs are now doing larger share platters for two or more people, which means not as much wastage.  We ordered platters of honey chicken, Mongolian beef plus a large special fried rice, which easily fed four of us with left-overs.
The food is fresh and cooked to order - we cannot fault the quality and the service."
The person working the take out counter at P.F. Chang's was very personable and friendly when I went to order take-out. I was sad to see how much P.F. Chang's changed their menu. There used to be more vegetarian choices but it seems they took those away. I was especially sad to see that they replaced their spicy cauliflower tempura appetizer with brussel sprouts. I mean I don't know anyone who eats brussel sprouts and likes it let alone replacing a classic with this option. Very disappointing P.F. Chang's!!!
Because we are Asians so we know that the food serving in the restaurant isn’t authentic. It was a huge disappointment especially the fried rice and ramen. The other two dishes I ordered were fine as I chosen something “safe”. The dishes are done to suit the American tastebuds too much. We think the owner should try to be more “real” and come up with some real tasty authentic Chinese cuisines.
"Thoroughly enjoyed the Honey Chicken with noodles for two.  Paired with spring rolls and iced tea WOW, what a great lunch!"
"It was great! Clean, servers and hostess were friendly, has a great menu and great drink list. Food was incredibly fresh and tasty, prices were reasonable for Vegas on the strip, not really any more expensive then any other PF Changs anywhere else. And the food wasn't too salty, which I seem to run into a lot with Asians restaurants, which I really liked. Of course, you can add salt or soy sauce yourself if you prefer your food a little saltier.

They were open to 1:00AM every day, which is really great; most sit down, full service restaurants do not stay open this late, especially during the week in the winter. And if you have a Caesars Rewards card with reward credits and want to pay all - or part - of your bill with your RC's, they are 1 for 1, which is much better than the 1 for 2 many branded restaurants charge in the Caesars owned properties."
Our group of 8 ordered eight dishes to share plus soups and had more than enough with a great variety of tastes.  We liked every single dish we had and the service was very attentive but not intrusive.
We went at 11pm after arriving to Vegas. The service was ok.  The vegetarian lettuce was very good. I also had a cup of the egg drop soup it was good. I would definitely go back.
We really loved our meal here. Pot stickers and spring rolls to start then we had honey shrimp and honey chicken. Both came with rice. We could have shared one portion of food the portions here were enormous and delicious. Good service and good food
"We go to Vegas every year, but this was our first visit to this restaurant. We'll definitely go again. It was busy and buzzing but we were seated straight away. It was my husband, sister-in-law (who's a veggie) and myself. We all had starters and mains with a few glasses of wine and it came to $145 with the tip, which we thought was very reasonable. Everything was great, but the outstanding dishes were my sister-in-laws tempura poppers and stir-fried eggplant. The sweet chilli soy glaze on the eggplant was truly delicious!! And our server was so friendly we invited her to join us!!"
"Have gone here 15+ times over the past 17 years and got great food and great service during the early visits. But at some point the experience with the service has gotten worse with time. Previous Las Vegas trip in 2016, the food was very late coming out and the waitress just came out and told me the kitchen screwed up so my food was free before stalking off in a huff....guess she thought I would not leave a tip for free food.

Was staying at Bellagio in October and went across because didn't feel like going too far for dinner. Place was very busy, went up to the two hostesses and figured I would get the beeper and told it was at least 25min wait. Both women at the seating station just ignored me, talking back and forth about schedules and someone screwing up. After standing right in front of them for 10min without any hello or just a minute, I just left.

Actually went back next night because was going to see Piff the Magic Dragon and again did not want to go too far away for dinner. Different hostess who was much nicer, but still given a beeper and 10min wait even though place was half full. Waiter for the table next to mine was very nice telling me so-and-so would be my waiter and would be out in minute, but that turned into 10-15min. Ended up getting the hot and sour soup along with the Chang's chicken which were great; only thing was they switched serving plates since the last time I was there and the new plates make what you get look smaller than usual. After finishing, took 15min for the waiter to come by with the check and another 10min just to get the credit card back.

The food quality has held up with time but the service for me just keeps getting worse, especially if only one or two people (saw a couple of other singles who looked like they were waiting long times also). Best to go in a group. If you are by yourself, you are probably better off at the bar (but that was filled both nights for me and not an option). If very busy, pass and try again on a different day if you are finicky about the service."
"We had Sweet and Sour Chicken and Kau Pung Chicken and both were bland. Kau Pung should be hot ande spicy, though it was more soso with a little heavy pepper on it. Too many peanuts and too many peppers, with no real spice. Service was great by our waiter and the wait was not bad for a SEMA week. This was Friday night and they did fine on that level. Really just the food was lackluster and otherwise it was just alright."
"Perfect timing. On our way to see David Copperfield later in evening so we see PF Chang's and it is conveniently my favorite time, Happy Hour! When we arrived we were pleasantly greeted by the manager. We told her we""ll sit at the bar  and she told us that Robin, the bartender would take very good care of us. She was right! Love you, Robin!! We ordered pork dumplings and lettuce wraps to sjare as well as a pitcher of margaritas. Just the right amount of food and drink and all so tasty."
I also enjoy eating at a PF Changs.  We did eat twice here while our stay in Las Vegas.  The food was good with the exception of the Kung Po green beans which were cold the first night.  Flavor was good but not hot.  My sister ask for a special made meal which they were happy to make for her.  The downside is the music is so loud that you cannot carry on a conversation with someone across the table.  Also the air conditioner is always set on COLD so bring a jacket for sure.
"First of all when our server told us the meals where going to be on the large side, NAH!! They where pretty normal portions, had bigger. The food was average Chinese style except a bit dry (not a lot of sauce) which for this style of food served with rice was a little disappointing, you want your rice to soak up the sauces as with all the chines restaurants I've ever visited. They have images of peppers against some items on the menu to point out they are spicy, again NAH!! not in the slightest. They may contain a little spice but certainly not ""spicy"". All this being said the place was nice and the food wast plentiful and good enough to satisfy. Had a lot better for less money.  My local Chinese takeaway comes to mind, same food and less than half the price. PF Chang's, not what I expected :("
"I went to one of my favorite Chinese Restaurants thinking that they all do keep the same standards, service and quality of food. I was really disappointed this time, felt like I was in a fast food restaurant. My all time favorite, BBQ Ribs were cold and hard, I order a Mai Tai and it was nothing but juice with a lot of sugar, The Manager came and apologized about the ribs ($4.00 Happy hour price) and did not charge. The table was dirty, no silverware or napkins, really walkout of that Restaurant with a bad taste. What a waste,"

"A great restaurant at a reasonable price
This is a staple on the strip and stands out as a great  place to eat for families at a good price. Most mains will be 16-24 USD, and the quality is great. I’ve been there several times and the experience is reliable each time. The customer service is good as well. It won’t be a life changing experience but it’s a solid meal, especially if you’re on a budget. I’m a big fan of the sweet and sour chicken but haven’t found a meal I didn’t like there."
"We went on a Saturday without a reservation. Don't make that mistake! We waited 25-30 minutes for a table, then were seated on the second floor -- far away from everyone else in an empty section. Frustrating. As always, portions are huge, food is hot and fresh, and service is fast and friendly. Once you are seated."
"Enjoyed our late lunch here. Ribs, potstickers, vegetable chow mien, honey chicken & steamed rice. All very nice. Server was friendly & attentive. Enjoyed the cocktail selection."
I loved the freshness and quality in their food. Loved the rolls and enjoyed eating the food in the suite at the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas! Service was detailed in order taking and efficient. Wish we had a restaurant in Toronto.
I was amazed at how large the portions are for dinner. I am a big guy and barely could finish. Excellent service both times I ate there. I recommend the honey walnut prawns and the ribs
"Super impressed with this restaurant, normally struggle with gluten free chinese options but PF Chang’s had their own GF menu. It was so good that we returned for a second night. Definitely go for the chicken lettuce wraps!"
Went for happy hour and was disappointed in service. The food was ok. The atmosphere was ok. The service could have been much better.
"Despite being a chain they actually make food that is (mostly) really good. 
While the har gow (Shrimp Dumpling) dim sum was NOT good at all, the Red Curry chicken we had was great. Service was fantastic (very attentive). Would go again for the Red Curry, but will know better than to order dim sum dish next time :)"
Came for happy hour and they do not disappoint. The tempura poppers are amazing and the green beans are fantastic
"Chang's is one of our favorite places to eat, just wish they had one in Vancouver. We love the lobster avocado rolls, kung poa chicken and the fried rice. I've never been disappointed."
"Happened to come across this place on accident.  We had the best waiter Jeremy.  We got pitchers of Sake Sangria and a ton of appetizers for under $70 (3 in our party so we split the $70).  We loved it so much that we went back for happy hour again the next day (and to see Jeremy, of course).  The food is wonderful and the service even better."
"title says it all well after staying at the pool for hours we went down for late lunch and since it’s 82 degree outside we decided to stay in al fresco but since it’s bit sunny the server seems didn’t like working outside or he’s not feeling good no one knows but if your working in a place you expect to make tips people don’t want to see that. anyway since we already know what we want order taking didn’t took long here’s come our drinks he forgot one of it brought it after we asked for it and on his way he spilled it,
our orders came and they didn’t offer us our own plate so i have to ask for it since most of our orders are meant for sharing and the whole time we were eating he didn’t come back to check on us if we’re interested for dessert so i asked for the check, our bill is $150-ish tax included and still gave him a $60 tip then he showed us smile and start calling me boss (heheheh) he probably felt bad about the service he gave us hopefully he remember us ‘coz we like going here and don’t want to experience less than okay service or i’ll have to bring that to their attention."
"As the title reads, same quality of Changs food as all of them, however service was messed up by being slow on getting an incorrect bill resolved. Tip was aligned with this. Ok visit, just not great."
I always eat at P.F Chang’s when I am in Vegas. I love it there. The food was was still amazing but the service was slow. We still had a great time but after we got seated it was 10 minutes before the waiter came. Then lots of time passed before we got out drinks and our food. The server was really friendly and handled the section really well. I will return but I hope they work on there communication  and time management.
"Having read the reviews here I thought I would give this place a try.

It was busy, but we got seated within 10 minutes. So all good.

Ordered wonton soup, and the waiter said it was a bowl for 6, and the dry spare ribs.

The wonton soup had 3 wontons, so it was bit confusing how this was meant for 6 - 1/2 a wonton each? Anyway, there was only two of us so it was ok. The ribs were, however a mixture of cold and warm. Not great so we sent them back and asked for properly hot ones. They came back a bit warmer on one bite, but cold on others. Unbelievable.

My wife said, let's just pay for the starters and go elsewhere. But I said no, it can't get any worse. But it did. Don't you just wish you had listened to the sensible advice of your wife.....

We ordered two mains and rice. We stressed to the waiter that it would be great if it was hot! Both were cold when they came - I could put my finger straight into the bowl of rice and it was mildly warm. The waiter offered to make them again, but we had had enough. 

He called the Manager over and we told him about the cold food and that it was all basically a bit rubbish. 

He said 'don't get angry' and said they were short staffed and threw some fortune cookies on the table. I was not angry up to that point but I was certainly getting there! 

He said he would 'sort it out' and basically stormed off. We decided not to wait for his sorting out and just left without paying. Never have I done this before. 

Really being short staffed is not an excuse in a high footfall restaurant - either get more staff in, or limit your customers so you can service those you take in properly. 

I should have opened the fortune cookie - maybe it would have said:

'A good way to get angry is to eat cold food at P.F. Changs!'"
"Dining can be expensive in Vegas, so I always come here for at least one meal,  Great food and service as always@"
"We were disgusted at the price of bottle beer and left 2 of the restaurant near Chang's.  I had ginger chicken ($17.50) which had way too much brocholli and not enough chicken.  My husband had sesame chicken ($16.50) and he enjoyed it very much.  Our server, Charles, was excellent and very helpful."
Food was excellent. Service was exceptional. We what to wait for a table but it was not a long wait and they have beepers to alert you.
The waiter did a great job getting us served with hot food (I hate cold food- unless it’s supposed to be cold...LOL) we were going to a concert right after and our time was limited. The food was great and he was very helpful when a couple of people ate gluten free. The restaurant was very busy and we were a group of 8. We all were very happy!
Such tasty food. Huge portions of great food. Waiting staff very efficient and can split the bill to couples if in a big group.
"You must try the lettuce wraps!  Yes, they are known for the wraps, but’s it’s all about the friendly atmosphere, great drinks and amazing food. You will start with the wraps and end up trying all the rest of the great entrees to choose from.  The staff is friendly and professional.  Last night, we were lucky to have Oscar as our server and he was fantastic!"
"recently visited. the food was good so was the drinks. the service was a bit slow. we were next to a private room, so we were ignored quite a bit"
"Kristi was an absolutely wonderful provider for our evening of relaxing. I recieved a gift card from a student of mine. A special night night made so much more perfect by Kristi with her special patio service. We were the only o es out there and she made a special trip many many times! 
Thank you so much for great memories!"
"Stopped in for a quick lunch and boy was I not disappointed!
The service was very friendly and super fast. The steamed pork dumplings were great as was the crispy shrimp roll. I absolutely loved the chicken lettuce wraps and the japanese old fashioned topped it off nicely.
What can I say..... great service, fair price and quality food.
Definitely coming back for more."
We had reservations which I would highly recommend as they are always busy. Their menu has changed but the food is still delicious. The wait staff were very friendly but had a little trouble keeping up. One of our dishes came out late but I think they forgot it originally.
"PF Chang’s is great, if you love Chinese food it is definitely worth trying out. We were able to get a table no problem, we only had to wait 5 minutes.

We had chicken lettuce wraps to start, they may not sound too appealing but trust me they are fantastic. We had Chang’s Spicy Chicken and Mongolian Beef for mains with white rice - we always have this when we visit as it is a great combination and both taste so so so good. The chicken is similar to shredded crispy chicken and chilli sauce from a Chinese in the UK and the beef is strips of marinated steak in soy sauce with veg.

Recommended!!!"
"My hubby and I had a bad experience with breakfast and did not want to eat a lot.  We decided to try PF Chang's for Happy Hour.   We ordered 4 things - lettuce wraps, the Mongolian pot stickers, the egg rolls and the bbq ribs.  The bbq ribs were a let down as you paid $4.00 for two of them with no meat but the sauce was good.  The rest of the food was great.   And enough for a light dinner.   Would go back again just for the Happy Hour!"
The food is so delicious we ate here twice this week.  It is nice that my husband and I both love the food. We will be back next trip.
The service was great. We had a group of 8 and sometimes with a larger group its hard to get great service. NOT HERE!! They did a great job - just leave plenty of time for the traffic you may encounter as Planet Hollywood was a zoo! Our food was hot and timing of the service was perfect. Chinese food was the perfect choice the food was tasty and not a heavy meal before the concert. They also had great Gluten free options for a few in our group....
"Our server was the usual, full of happiness, American server. We shared a lettuce / mince for starters and shared Mongolian beef, Kung POI prawns and black pepper chicken. The food arrived far too quickly for my liking as we hadn’t finished our starter.  I had been told by several people that food here is “ out of this world.” It wasn’t. It was ok but nothing special.
As I was ordering I asked Phillip if would could swap out a rice, which accompanied each dish , for one portion of noodles.” No” was his reply and then tried to persuade me that we were getting back he rice for free! At almost £20 per serving it did not appear that they were being over generous. I pointed out that there should be a facility to swap or merely buy some plain noodles. He didn’t seem happy with my challenge . He then walked away with a $16 tip.
The two stars were for the food. I won’t be tempted by this restaurant again."
"Absolutely the worst experience on the Strip. Food was drenched in oil, and everything tasted like fish...Service was exceptionally poor, and our wine we ordered at start of evening arrived after main meal! Glasses were filthy...absolutely appalling...avoid at all cost!"
"We decided to dine there a couple of days ago. Julie had vegetable spring rolls, whilst I had the hot and sour soup. Both were edible but uninspiring and quite frankly below average. For her main Julie had Chicken with steamed broccoli. The broccoli was under cooked whilst the chicken was overcooked and rubbery and the sauce was lacking any real flavour. I had the crispy honey chicken with egg fried rice. Some parts of thge chicken were crispy, but other parts non crispy at all and the chicken was dry and hard to eat. The rice was lacking any real flavour. Overall, it was a real disappointment."
"One of our favourite places when we visit Vegas. Starters not hot but returned to kitchen and fresh ones served with no fuss. Enjoyed the Mongolian Beef and Chicken Pad Thai.. all lovely and fresh .. only comment is plates are thick heavy and always cold so food chills quickly!.,"
"Went to the planet Hollywood hotel location, it is a dark light setting, ordered some chicken dish and fried noodles, quite Western style of cooking and the sause used may be contain msg or not natural enough, the tongue can felt them after sometime later. If you go to higher level Chinese restaurant such as Super8 at Wynns and ordered something like fried rice, you will feel the difference. Overall, the price is in the middle of the pack, price and food quality higher than Panda outlets but for sure should not compare to the higher level ones as you get what you pay for."
excellection selection of food and all was prepared properly Menu was very helpful by descriptions of all
Told a 20 minute wait. Party of 2. They forgot about us. 45 minutes later we were seated. They apologized but no compensation.
This is always our first stop when arriving in Vegas.  Great place to grab a snack and drink while waiting for our room to be ready for check-in.  Ribs are consistently good.  The bar area is pleasant and we always meet someone interesting to talk with.
"Party of 8 all enjoyed very attentive service after initial mix up with lost booking. We were advised by our server on how much to order. Food was really delicious. Everything was hot and plenty of it.
The mojitos were good too."
"PF Chang’s offers solid Asian choices. I have been multiple times and food quality is very good. Garlic chicken, salt and pepper prawns, chicken lettuce wraps and broccoli and beef are some of my favourites. Always busy. Make a reservation"
"Noisy , mass produced mass of poor food . Broccoli with the beef was raw , dim sum were cold , plates were cold , beef tasted like ham . Only the waitress who was pleasant and efficient is worth a mention . And the wine was harsh and not worth drinking . Avoid would be my advice . The only thing i got from this was my hunger was dealt with ; more than my partners who left the joint hungry rather than eat it !!"
This was one place where we found vegetarian option! Thank God. Food was tasty and staff were very nice inspite of the brisk business
Inside planet Hollywood with Street entrance also. 5 minute wait and friendly but professional server. Easy to understand menu and food arrived quickly and as ordered. All entrees were excellent and server was attentive without being intrusive. Great time.
"We were in Vegas for my birthday. I made online reservations in which I was asked if it was a special occasion. Checked in and a red paper indicating a special occasion was with my party. There were four of us. I was very disappointed in my meal. I ordered the shrimp, lobster and beef filet as a main dish. The fried shrimp and unrecognizable fried lobster was greasy. My filet was okay although some parts of it were hard to chew due to fatty areas. The one mushroom in the dish was as big as a thumb nail. Believing I would get a comped birthday dessert and perhaps singing of happy birthday would have made me forget about the so so meal I had. We heard others having birthdays and being sung to I anticipated that It would also happen to me. As we received the bill of almost $200.00 all I got was a “oh yeah..happy birthday” from  our waiter as we were leaving. Needless to say I was very disappointed. Others in my party loved their food so it wasn’t a total bust."
"This was my 1st experience at P.F.Changs (July 2019). I had heard good things about the restaurant but never took advantage of the opportunities to visit. On a couples trip and the ""group"" decision was made to eat here. I was not impressed at all with the food, the majority of the food was not seasoned to my personal taste, I had to do a lot of doctoring. Still didn't hit the spot like I was told it would. I love Asian cuisine, just won't be visiting Chang's again."
I went here for lunch with my girlfriend. We both had the Signature Lo Mein and it was very good. The prices were also very reasonable. I would suggest this as a good lunch location.

Visited three times as convenient. Acceptable quality. Restaurant looking tired. Outdoor dining area looks like an airport smoking area. Good menu choice. Food as you would expect from a chain restaurant. Staff hit and miss - we had an overweight bar server who looked and acted bored out of her mind - needs reminding it’s a service industry. Other staff on other visits looked demotivated and bored. Shame as they are the face of the restaurant. Much better food choices available elsewhere. Shame to report declining standards having visited annually since it opened.
"My first times. The lettuce wraps,blyeberry mojito,  and sesame  chicken amazing. Portion size  larger than i exspected."
I took my family here for dinner and I couldn’t fault the meal. The staff were good and our waiter was very friendly with the right balance of attentiveness. Our meals were delivered promptly and the food was delicious. Word of advice the portions were big compared to UK standards so we were all stuffed - but happy. It is located right on the strip and was busy but we were not rushed at all and had a great time for a good price! Thumbs up from this family!
Lovely food at reasonable price. Limited choice for vegetarians if you don’t like tofu. Restaurant was a bit dark and some diners were using their torch phones to read the menus. Great service.
"Been to PF Chang’s many times in the miracle mile, always had a great meal, very dissatisfied tonight, rice noodles weren’t cooked, was afraid I’d broken my crown, ordered chicken fried rice only had regular rice in one sticky lump very disappointed, dirty plates,  gone down in my estimations"
"I just love this restaurant. I talked wife and another couple into going as they have never been. It’s now their favourite restaurant as well.
It’s a shame we don’t have this chain in Canada. It is Chinese cuisine done to perfection.
We loved every dish they served."
Excellent food and very quick service. It was also very cheap food but at a real good quality! We will definitely return. Fabulous place for friends or family.
"Food: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Decor & Style: 5/5

This location is huge, two stories. Service was decent and our server was very personable which I find important. The food however is just okay, nothing spectacular. I ordered the peppered steak with rice which was good enough to eat but i've had much better at many other places.
At least the ambience here was vibrant and fun, it is Vegas after all."
"Dined whilst visiting U.S - shared pork dumplings, Mongolian beef & fried rice. Food was tasty but not very hot in temperature. Service friendly. Very big & busy place, make sure you book ahead."
"Always Busy and may need to wait but a definite go-to place wherever you can find PF Chang.....Orange Chicken is great, fried rice, YUM and Pot Stickers are a great appetizer while waiting."
PF Chang's never disappoints. The food and the service was great. The management did a good job to accommodate our group of 10 on short notice. We will definitely be back.
"I can always count on a great meal at PF Chang’s and the one on Las Vegas Strip by Planet Hollywood is no exception.  Their chicken lettuce wraps and entree’s  such as honey crisp shrimp, Mongolian beef, and orange peel chicken  were all delightful and served quickly.  Service was good too even though the restaurant had a wait list.

Worth the visit for dinner or lunch."
Just on the strip near the planet Hollywood hotel and casino. Nice Ambience and very courteous staffs. We went there on a Friday evening without reservation and were seated immediately. The food was fine. I liked the orange shrimps very much. But the best was the pomegranate lemonade. In a hot summer evening it was very refreshing.
"We decided to go get a bite to eat, the traffic from RDU was horrific going back to Fayettville so we got something to eat at PF Chang it was so good I had the shrimp fried rice and the lettuce wrap and a pomegranate lemonade it was awesome my sister had the mandarin salad a meal for kings"
"We made reservations ahead of time, glad we did as the place was packed. We arrived for 8pm, got our table right away overlooking the strip. All the apps, mains and dessert were delicious, don't think you can go wrong with any choice here."
Was hoping for better as I had been here before and liked it. I asked for a table for 1 and was instead coerced into sitting at the upstairs bar despite many open tables. The alcoholic drink didn't seem to have any alcohol in it. The egg rolls were small. They served the egg rolls with a mustard sauce which wasn't that good. I just really don't like bar stools with my feet off the floor like that.
"Went there for dinner and wow what a great meal. The service was outstanding Curtis our server was a 10. The place was slammed and did he ever hustle, super nice and everything came out perfect, the Northern Ribs were the best I ever had, Reservations are a must"
Wonderful food. Authentic.  Large servings.  Always fresh.  This is a go to restaurant for me. Great service and knowledgeable staff.  Lettuce wraps are my favorite.  Steamed dumplings are also quite good.
The chicken egg rolls are to die for they are amazing.plus all the other food .we come here every year and are never disappointed .staff is great also.
"I visited in 2012, 2017, 2018 - Cant wait to visit again! The service is fantastic and so is the food! We enjoy eating family style and it's a great way to try everything. Everything on the menu is terrific! Must visit!!"
"First of all, I have posted this to the wrong g PF Changs. It should be the one in Town Square and even though I have added it as a new place. TRIPADVISOR  has not made it happen. 

Anyway,  Arturo is a very good server. Food seemed different this visit so not sure if a new chef or recipe.  Even my colleague commented unsolicited his seabass was blah."
Good food but they spilled sweet and sour sauce all over my new jeans. He just said oops and walked off. I told another waiter and he just brought me another napkin like 20 minutes later. They were not bothered in the slightest.
Great meal and great service when visiting. You must note the portion sizes are humongous though. See picture this was what we thought for two people but was too much in the end. Good snack to take back to the room though. Would definitely return.
"Ate here late one night after walking the strip.  There was no wait time and the restaurant was filled up.  Jeremy our server was EXCELLENT by being very attentive and by having great conversation.  Food prices is about average with other PF Chang’s restaurants.  Ordered orange chicken, crispy green beans, and hot and sour soup.  Food was great!"
"We dined here last night and walked away delighted. The food here is amazing and as good as Asian cuisine we have had during a fine dining experience in other high end restaurants. We had the Thai Harvest Vegetable curry, miso salmon and crab wontons for starters which was more than enough for two people. We were so full we couldn’t fit in desert. Our dining experience  was made so enjoyable with the best service we have ever received during our dining experience from our waiter Phillip! Phillip made us comfortable and provided an unfailing service, from his general conversation, to the prompt service of our meal. He even replaced my coke with a fresh one when it was half finished and replaced the rice after our first serve- all of which was unexpected but another part of his wonderful service. Phillip should be commended for a wonderful job he does in providing such a enjoyable experience to the restaurants patrons. Keep up the great work Phillip- we’ll be sure to ask for one of your tables next time we visit."
Great food. The service was good but stretched thin. The prices are fair. This place is always busy. So if going for dinner make a reservation. The chicken lettuce wraps are wonderful.
"P.F Changs meal portion are huge and food is tasty. You cannot go wrong with little Oriental cuisine that tastes very good. I like to order pork dumpling with some pork fried rice. Pork was very delicious and fried rice was yummy. So if you want to seat down and if you are craving chinese head over to P.F Chang's, there is little something for everyones taste."
The food is good here me and 2 co workers went here during a conference for lunch and we ordered all one dish each and shared it was plenty enough food to fill us up and still have a little left over. We come here every year at the same time we go to a conference in April.
"Ordered thru Grubhub arrived cold, none of the special request where done.  The company ( grubhub) basically told us we where out of luck. $100 worth of food thrown away. I don't know how it works but I would bet that PF Chang's told them how to deal with it.  So overall 
I would never use Grubhub and questionable if I would go to resturant."
It was great to get out of the Cosmopolitan hotel for one evening before a show.  My steamed Schezwan Shrimp and vegetable noodles was delicious.  The restaurant is large and nicely decorated with tables spaced out.  Good night and good value.

Love this restaurant so much we came twice to eat.  They always make my favorite dish double pan fried shrimp.  And the second time was shrimp Lo mein.  Love love ❤️
We stopped in here since the line for Burger was super long. I'm glad we did the food was wonderful! P.F. Chang's is usually pretty good but the food at this one was way better! The service was great as well!
We picked up a takeaway on the way back to our hotel and it was lush. The portions were huge and the food was amazing. As everyone says the orange chicken is mega.
Went here for lunch and it was delicious. Our server was great and the food portions were huge. They are enough to share with a partner or friend.
"Great service, quick to get to a table and good selection of food & drinks. I’ll get beef dishes were divine but a word of warning - portion sizes are on the larger side so be mindful when ordering. A regular haunt when we’re in Vegas - will definitely return :)"
"We missioned up the strip to get here, we missed lunch so things were getting a bit intense, but we know PF Chang’s look after vegetarians, and they really did! The tofu was amazing!!! Our whole meal was so good, drinks delicious too. I know it’s a chain, but when you want a vegetable feast, they never disappoint!"
"My wife and I enjoyed sushi and a vegetarian curry and weren't disappointed, exceptional quality, fresh, fresh, fresh and all at very reasonable prices. The accompanying wine list is varied and at very good cost as well. If you are hesitating because P.F. Chang's is an Asian-themed US casual dining restaurant chain, I can assure you that the decor, ambiance and dining experience is anything but 'casual'. We dined at the peak of lunch on 06 May and although the restaurant was busy, we did not have to cue."
"I know it's a chain, but I've never had a bad meal at PF Changs.  The restaurant can be a little chaotic, and it's a bit dark in there, but one of the best meals we had during our stay!"
"On our last night in Las Vegas my husband and I had a fantastic meal at PF Changs on the Strip. 

We booked conveniently that afternoon via the PF Changs website and were seated promptly on arrival. It was very busy but the waiter was cheerful and organised, ensuring our drinks order was fulfilled immediately. 

The meal itself was excellent. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps and pork spare ribs to start, with Signature Blavk Pepper Chicken and Beef a la Szechuan for mains with a side of fried rice and lo mein. The portions were very good and tasted absolutely delicious. We washed the meal down with several glasses of wine (red and white from a very good wine list - unlike many other restaurants in Las Vegas) and finished with the New York Cheesecake and Chocolate Lava cake for dessert.

Eating in Las Vegas was hit and miss for us but this meal surpassed expectations. It wasn't cheap, but was good value for money, in my opinion. Would definitely eat at this chain again if travelling to the US and most definitely at this particular location if I was in Las Vegas again."
Good food and attentive service.  We were located in an upstairs area so the whole group could be together and we had enough servers to ensure that the food and drinks arrived in a timely fashion.
"First time at this location of Chang’s, loved it.
Food was superb and the service was just great too."
"If you have eaten at a P.F. Chang's before it is just like any other P.F. Chang's.  The food is good, we had the beef broccoli and some spring rolls.  It was very good.  We had a bunch left over so we took it with us and gave it to a homeless person, who dove right in to eat it."
"Visited the restaurant to celebrate a big birthday and we were left disappointed.
The main came before the starters, then the main meat arrived with out the rice for a long while (Visa versa)
It was defintely busy,but it didnt live up to our expectation.
The manager tried to resolve the issue,but it left the family feeling deflated.
Ithink it is probably more organised, but we just chose the wrong day and time. A shame!!"
"Located in the front of the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. My wife and I dined here for dinner 4/21/2019.  We shared three dishes.  A Chinese Chicken Salad, beef dish and a chicken dish.  All the food came out at the same time?  We requested the salad to be served first.  

Things have changed since our last visit.  TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!!  Whatever manager is running this place needs some major training on how to run a restaurant.  The music is cranked up like a nightclub. P.F. Chang's  is a chain and the only reason I dined there because I was on a full comp.  

Once the manager(s) get retained, perhaps they can explain to the employees how to treat customers and serve food in order. Just a thought?

I added many photos of our visit.  This four bubble review on Trip Advisor is very generous."
"My family and I came for dinner and had to wait for 20 minutes for our 2 course meal to come and when we got it, they were cold! Our server was kind enough to get it resolved with the Manager and he was terrible. To top it up, they were charging us for the replacement of the cold fried rice. 
Love Vegas, but P.F. Chang, not so much!
When you walk by and think you want some Chinese food, go to Chinatown instead!"
"Hi, We dined here on 29/3/19. We were disappointed with the service and the food. The staff were disinterested and my daughter's Buddha's Feast was basically boiled rice and vegetables. However my main reason for writing this review is to warn customers to check their credit card statements. We discovered that our credit card recepit had been REPRINTED. The gratuity had been increased and my husband's signature had been forged. Eventualy we got a full refund for our meal but just wanted to warn others about this scam."
We stayed at Paris and walked over for dinner. The service was excellent and very quick. Our server was very courteous and helpful. The kids enjoyed sesame chicken and my husband d I shared Korean beef dish. The strawberry ginger margarita was too sweet to my taste. Definitely recommend.
"Got recommended by the reviews, decided to try it out. i ordered one hot and sour soup and one Singapore noodle. Was very disappointed with the presentation and the taste. I felt like i got two plates of free lemon juice. And the noodle looked very dark that it cooked with soy sauve only, oily and salty. Only these two cost me almost AED 80, obviously not worth at all.  I dont think i would try it again."
"Ate here after a show one night and was pleasantly surprised.We were seated outside as the evening was quite warm.The range of asian inspired cuisine was impressive as was the service.The food was fresh and very tasty.We had noodles,prawns,chicken beef and rice dishes all perfectly presented."
"Ate at their as I was solo, service was very good.  Kungpao chicken was very good.  It was fresh, hot and nicely presented.  I try to avoid chains, but have found P.F. Chang's is very consistent and have good food."
"Our reservation was 7:00 and we didn’t get seated until 7:19. Other than that, it was a very nice evening."
"Beautiful decor, great waiter and food.   Food was great quality and was served in large bowls so you could share and taste other dishes."
"We have eaten at PF Changs in various cities, Colorado Springs, Sacramento and it was always one of our favorite places.  The food at this restaurant is not how we remembered it.  The Mongolian Beef was over cooked and sparse among the green onions.  The Changs Chicken was different than in other restaurants we have eaten in.  The service was ok.  I would not go back to this particular restaurant."
"We ate here just because we could not get a table somewhere else, but I am glad we did.
The food was excellent, so good that Sandra, who normally does not enjoy Chinese food, said it was really tasty.
The whole experience was made much better by Justin, the waiter. He was so attentive without being over the top and annoying.
He was very enthusiastic and made sure we were served well.
He was the epitome of what a good waiter should be. If only they were all like him."
The food was exceptional and they gave you a lot.  I noticed most people were taking boxes of food home from the restaurant.  The food was absolutely delicious.  Warm atmosphere and the waiter was great.  He checked with us several times to see if we needed anything.  He recommended meals before we ordered.  He asked how we liked the food and if it was cooked to our liking (which was wonderful).  I recommend you eat at this restaurant.
"Wonderful service, fast and friendly!
We had a table of 5 and shared several entree dishes and the bowl of wonton soup. Superb! Definitely will return. Make reservations though! You will need it.
On open table!!"
"Restaurant was half empty, 3 waiters standing around doing nothing - yet it took 20 minutes to get water and order. Was consistently raising my hand, made eye contact with two waiters who just kept walking and pretended to be busy. The only waiter not visibly standing around was ours, he had disappeared for 10 minutes and the other waiters clearly couldn’t be bothered attending to us as we weren’t their assigned table (even though they weren’t doing anything). Terrible."
This was my second visit here and was totally disappointed. The service was slow to non existent. Was seated in a half empty restaurant under the stairs tucked away. Drinks took forever to arrive at the table it was like we were inconveniencing them as it was a long walk from the bar. My meal was sent back as was probably the worst Vietnamese food I have ever eaten. At least they took it off my bill. Will not be back.
Ordered the Buddhas feast to go. All I got was steamed rice and vegetables. No seasoning or anything. Horrible. Do not recommend.
"On our two visits we were served both times by Becky.  The first time we had our Caesars Concierge Michael with us.  He insisted on taking him to lunch for all the work he has done for us.  Turned out there were changes in his department, yet his supervisor felt he needed to be at lunch with us.  Thank you very much.  Enjoyed being able to put a face to the voice and email.  Mike has always looked after us and hopefully will continue to for a long time.
Becky was quickly able to describe each dish we inquired about and made spot on recommendations."
"Great food and super fast service, the dynamite shrimps are to die for and the best. Lettuce wraps are just awesome. Great place to have a snack, a casual drink and dinner. Right on the strip and one can sit outside and watch the crowds and get entertained"
We recently were in Las Vegas for a short holiday to help our son get married.  The Wedding Dinner was held in the somewhat private upper lounge and a good time was had by all. The service was very attentive and the food was actually very tasty.  Definitely a night ro remember.
"Don'f often review chain restaurants but felt i needed to after the meal we had here. I had the black pepper chicken & rice which was excellent and the other members of the party also really enjoyed their meals. Place was clean, the staff were attentive & efficient and  the food arrived promptly and more importantly hot. Overall not a bad word to say about this place - Food was lovely."
"“Hi, I’m Mike. I’m a Kung Pao-holic” Lol...
One would think, that after a couple of memorable Japanese and sushi nights, I’d be done with my little tour of Asia this trip: but not so fast. I’ll admit, I’m a fanatic of the Kung Pao Chinese dishes, especially with shrimp. And I’ll say one thing about PF: this is one dish that they do up right. It’s fairly authentic, and has just enough heat to make the flavors pop. There’s other dishes here as well, but most are just ok: though, I do think their spicy Szechuan beef is worth a try. Service at this location is good, at least at the bar. Note: This is a very busy location, so plan on a wait for an actual table. Enjoy..."
Had a lovely meal here last night. Food was amazing and good size portions. The staff were attentive and very polite. Worth the money and would visit again.
"Oh ny gish, my friend took me there. And I was blown away how nice and efficient the server was. The food was so good and plenty of it, we had enough left over another meal."
"Three of us dropped by here for supper one evening.  Started the meal with lettuce wraps, which were marvelous, as usual.  Then we had mongolian beef, a chicken dish and steamed rice.  The beef was delicious - tender but crispy in a tasty sauce.  The chicken had just the right amount of kick to it.  My only complaint was that the serving amounts were somewhat limited - they could add just a little more to the plates for sharing."
"A short wait on a Saturday night, friendly server and delicious miso salmon and orange chicken. It's nice to get what you pay for and walk away without any complaints! A well run busy place inside Planet Hollywood hotel, we will be back."
Busy place. Great food. Nice ambiance. Nice food. Great variety. Busy. The mixed noodles are funny as everything is served separately on platter. Overall great
"We went here our first night staying at Planet Hollywood. Lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, dumplings and chicken pad Thai were all really tasty. Happy hour was fun for a few yummy cocktails too."
"Stopped in with a friend for lunch.
I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps along with the crab ragnoon. The service was great and the food even better."
Great food and good drinks ate at the bar they are very friendly and the Chang’s spicy chicken with brown rice is amazing!!  It was so good we ate there twice
"We were roaming on the strip and saw this. Came here for dining. We got the small table near the window overlook of strip. Service was very slow. The waiter came for drink order after 10 minutes. And it was not crowded at all. Anyway, we ordered Chang’s spicy chicken and chicken fried rice.
Fried rice was good, but we returned spicy chicken as it was very blunt with no vegetables. Not sure why they call it their specialty.  We ordered Thai harvest curry with chicken, little did I know my wife does not like coconut in Thai curry. 

So it was fried rice which saved us .lol.. but Thai curry was good. Time taken in both the entrée, was too much and we finished our rice meanwhile, so when Thai curry came, no rice left in the plate.

The ambiance was good, but service was very very slow."
"Ate lunch here for the first time.  Seated quickly and got prompt, friendly service including comments from the waitress for various dishes which I REALLY appreciate.  She warned me that the dish I was about to order was HOT!  I like hot food and this filled the bill.  It was reasonably priced and very tasty.  I plan to return again on our next trip to Vegas."
"Food was good, service was great. We always share the mongolian beef and chicken lettuce wrap....can't go wrong."

"This restaurant maintains the same high standard that I have experienced in their Waikiki location. The atmosphere was very pleasant, the food was of good quality and the service level was high. I will always go back to this restaurant."
"First time eating in a PF Chang's and definitely won't be the last..
Walked in, got a table no problem...
Great service, great cocktails to choose from...
Egg rolls were absolutely delicious, reasonable prices..
Overall great experience, good vibe in here.. can't wait to try another..."
"Staying recently at Planet Hollywood we decided to try PF Chang’s for an early dinner one night. Fortuitously, we arrived in time for their Happy Hour. Besides fair drink prices we were able to sample several of their Happy Hour food specials. The Chang’s Lettuce Wraps were great, we can see why they’re a house speciality! We also shared orders of their pork dumplings, crispy green beans and dynamite shrimp. Portion size was perfect and each dish we had was excellent. Our service was fast, efficient and friendly. We’ll definitely visit PF Chang’s again when we’re at Planet Hollywood!"
"Stopped here while staying at Planet Hollywood. 
First off, it's a very busy restaurant and you can expect a 5 or 10 minute wait for two people, significantly more if you're in a group. Secondly, if you're vegetarian, you'll find some pretty good choices, especially when compared to other restaurants in the area. We ordered the crispy green beans (a little over battered and needed seasoning), ma po tofu (amazingly good tofu, but the steamed broccoli needed seasoning - yes it's steamed, but does it need to be bland??) and buddha's feast. The tofu and feast were delicious. Overall, the service was good, too. Our waiter was very friendly and was able to answer any questions we had. We thought we'd have to wait a long time to get served, but he was always there when needed. I'd suggest trying PF Chang's at least once during your stay. Keep in mind that it leans towards the pricier side."
"The service, food and price was amazing! Everything was so delectable! Nothing was less than perfect."
"Waited for table almost one hour, food was completely average, its better at some chinese fast foods. Our starter was forgotten and brought together with main course. Waitress was really friendly however that didnt improve our impression. Would not go again."
"We were in and out in 30mins. The food on the happy hour menu is limited, but we weren't looking for a large meal. We tried 4 different appetizers and all were excellent. The waitor was super friendly and energetic. I would eat here again."
"Just a short review.  Love Chang’s.  Great food, service and a decent value.  Love being able to get take out, right on casino floor.  That’s it, I’m out 👍🏻"
We ordered Orange peel shrimp as a late evening snack.  The dish was plenty for two people and delicious. Never disappointed at PF Chang's.
"Lovely Asian cuisine steps away from the gaming tables inside Planet Hollywood. Desserts are majestic. Especially the chocolate cake.  Gets crowded at times and the wait could be 30 mi,utes or more for larger parties.  Ask your server for their suggestions you can’t go wrong."
"Sat at the bar and the bartender was one of the most helpful people I have ever encountered in Las Vegas, I ordered with him and was helped right away.  I had walnut shrimp with melon, delicious!!"
"Was recommended this restaurant by a friend and it was fab, lovely food, big portions, so you can share. My husband had the surf and turf, he said it was the best he's ever had. Our server was a guy called Peter, he was excellent, friendly and knowledgeable. You would need to reserve a table as the restaurant can get quite busy, but it's worth it."
P.F. Chang's is a vegetarian friendly Chinese restaurant situated in Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. Two more P.F. Chang's are there in Las Vegas. Decorated in Chinese theme is a good stopover for our tiring walk across several casinos.
"Stopped in for lunch on a very busy day .  Got great service , quickly seated , reasonable prices with excellent tasting food . 

There is better Chinese in Vegas , but when on the strip , this is a convenient stop when up by mgm grand ."
"I arrived in LV really late and under the weather. After traveling all day I needed something to eat. Lettuce wraps sounded awesome. While traveling I usually stay away from chains but the restaurant was handy. The young hostess acted like it was a bother to seat one person at a table instead of the bar... once seated I met JAL - short for jalapeño. He was friendly, professional and took excellent care of me"
Went here with a large group.  Very busy and noisy restaurant.  Asian food selection is good.  Suited the needs of the night - however there are many other food options in Vegas that are much better.  Mid priced menu selection with full service bar.
We like to have dinner and drinks at the bar. Then you can people watch. The bar staff is normally very friendly and bubbly but one lady that was at the end of bar making drinks was not a happy camper. It looked like most were afraid of her sourly attitude. The food was great as usual but dint like her attitude.
"We eat here at least once every visit to Vegas and have never been disappointed.
Early dinner which was all appetizers. We were a party of 6. Ordered the lettuce wraps, Ricks Northern Ribs and one each pork and shrimp of the dumplings. All were done very well and filling enough for the group. 
The topper was the Great Wall of Chocolate, it was chocolate heaven! Enough for all six of us to have some and fill our chocolate fix after the great meal."
"12 of us ate hear post wedding.
We booked in advanced, and set some requirements. 
A busy place so was a bit apprehensive on  arrival. However the service and quality of food was excellent.
We are from England and the food served here far exceeded my expectations.
As considering the location it was extremely good value for money.
I will certainly return here and I can't say that about the other places we ate in Vegas."
PF Changs is a well maintained and monitored franchise. We order the same every place we go and its always the same and delicious. The best Mai Tai I've had since Hawaii or San Francisco. NO damned pink drink Mai Tais here. Mongolian Beef or the Sweet and Sour Chicken.
"Reasonable price for big portion of food, great service from our waitress. I've not been to P.F Changs before this but the wife as. food tasted amazing as it was really fresh, Ahi Tuna was lovely as too were the Vietnamese noodle salad and the Lo mein for myself"
Most the restaurants on the strip you pay double. This one was more in line with what you pay at a normal pf chang's. The food and service was good.
"Changs has the best lettuce wraps!  They are so tasty and fresh.  Add another appetizer, and for two people, you can have a complete meal."
"wow, this was our first visit and we love chinese, this was one of the best chinese we have had and its a chain. the food is not salty or gluppy like others, the service is amazing the price is also amazing. fresh, delicious and highly recommend"
"We went twice while in Vegas over Christmas and had a great meal both times. Restaurant is buzzing and has a great feel to it so we'd recommend the food as well as the atmosphere.
One downside is that they're so busy they try to free up tables more quickly than we're used to in the UK. Management ask staff to take your dessert order while you're half way through your main which feels pressured.
But don't miss out. Just ask them to come back when you're ready!"
"We had a very bad experience at this restaurant. 
Firstly, we had a reservation but when we arrived, we had to wait in line for 15 min before we were able to speak to the hostess. Then we have to wait for another 15 min to get a table. Moreover, the restaurant was really noisy and dirty.
Secondly, the waitress were cold, impatient and showed an attitude when we were slow to order. 
Finally, the food quality is the worst. We ordered Pad Thai, Kong Pao shrimp and Mongolian beef. The Pad Thai tasted like garbage with burned tofu, raw carrot and bean sprouts on the side (never seen a Pad Thai cooked this way). The Kong Pao shrimp is this their ad menu but it was really just deep fried shrimp. The Mongolian beef was dried as wood. It was impossible to swallow. 
In fact, this restaurant fells all of the three standards: the ambiance, the service, the food quality. Not recommended!!!"
"We had a late dinner here on New Years day and it was less than enjoyable.

Service? What service? I should have guessed when we were told 15 minute wait and walked outside and down the hall and 1 minute later were called back.

Where did it progress from here? We’ll I ordered a drink with the bus boy 3 times! We weren’t even given waters when we sat down (despite everyone else getting them).

Food-
Dumplings- A-Mazing
Sweet and Soup- I couldn’t even touch it was horrible.
Wonton soup- flavour lacking, but eatable- how could you share this between 6 people when you only get 2 wontons?! The heck??

Miss at all costs."
"After having a late night for NYE, we got moving pretty late and saw PF Chang’s had happy hour from 3-6. The restaurant was swamped with people waiting for tables but we quickly found 2 seats at the bar. The bartender was quick to greet and serve us. We ordered a few things to share for a late lunch. I’d recommend this place, especially as the prices are affordable by Vegas standards. Be prepared to wait though depending on the time you go!"
"We needed to eat dinner early to allow us to go to a show and we chose this option. It’s been years since I’d been in a PFChangs and was very pleasantly surprised by the staff who were friendly and efficient and the food which was delicious. Portions are large so best to select fewer (than people) and share amongst the table. All in all, a very good choice and some very good food. Definitely recommended."
"I was surprised at the Surf and Turf...good dish.  Also, the Brussels sprout side was well worth it.
Hint:  eat at the bar to avoid the long wait."

"Excellent hospitality. Good food. Wonderful ambience.
But queues excessive, even though there is space inside"
"Sat at the bar during happy hour.  Quick, friendly service.  Great happy hour food with good size portions.  Two of us shared the lettuce wraps, pot stickers and an eggplant entree."
Everytime we are in Vegas we always have our Asian food cravings here. It never fails to impress us on food quality and service. Ate here twice within a 5-day holiday. Yum!
"This newest PF Chang’s outlet in Las Vegas serves up their delicious food in the Town Square mall on the strip. The menu is the same, and their ingredients and cooking methods are top notch. Try their signature Lettuce wraps, then on to some yummy ckn or shrimp dishes. All served by our attentive waiter. Room for dessert? If you can, try the chocolate cake. There were 6 of us and we all left full and satisfied."
"popped in 11pm (ish) 
Friday night
expected alot, thought it be great
but turned out to be very average 
what was bad: everybody's food was luke warm
what was good: Justin the waiter

what was good: the food next day when we warmed it up

what was bad: still tasted average

So many choices in Vegas for chinese/japanese food and this place did not meet my expectation

sorry guys"
"Our beautiful server, Solange, spreading her unicorn magic, helped me choose a delicious adult beverage; the Mai Tai was soooooo good I had 3 of them! And my friend's coconut mojito was wonderful!  👍to the bartender! The Kung Pao chicken was amazing,  as well as the lettuce wraps. Mmmmmm...I love PF Chang's,  I wish we had one in Amarillo, TX."
"We were staying at Planet Hollywood and I wanted Chinese.  So my husband and I (retirement age) went to PF Chang for the second time.  (First time was a horrible, server forget my order and while everyone else ate, I just sit there).  It had been several years, so we thought we would come back.  The place was not busy, but they gave us a beeper anyway, so we sat, while couple after couple came in and they were seated right off the back.  There was only 2 of us.  The final straw was went 3 young girls came in and the guy on (Dec1, afternoon) who was seating everyone, just about had a heart attack to seat them as quickly as he could.  Needless to say, we walked out, I doubt they even missed us, but I think after two times, it is time to tell everyone just how important you are to their business, needless to say, being old is not important to them at all.  Steer away. they have other nice places to eat, I recommend HEX, in front of Paris, they have great service"
"We loved our food, waitress and everything about our dining experience here. The value is unbeatable."
Overall it was good. There was a lot of flavor in the dishes and they were served hot. The crab Rangoon had a lot of crab in it and the peppers added a lot of flavor. The waitress was friendly and provided good service.
Clearly the best meal of our trip. Outstanding service and the food was excellent. Well done. Mini was very good and the wine options were quite large. Would highly recommend.
"Tasty tasty food, amazing prices and great drinks selection, we loved this place on our trip it was fab we wish we had came more than once it was fab. Really do recommend the food here"
Food was really Good had the Mongolian Surf n Turf and the Place Vibe was awesome. Enjoy the Outside ambient and will recommend to come for sure!
We took our baby here and they were able to accommodate us easily. It’s a busy place and the food is very good. Great Chinese/Asian food and not greasy. We had the bbq spare ribs (amazing) and chicken lettuce wraps to start. Then we had the street noodles and spicy chicken. Both were very good! Dishes all come with white or brown rice. Our server was nice. We were too full for dessert but the menu looked good. We will be back again in the future.
"We were in Vegas for our wedding, and all of our guests wanted to go out for a dinner beforehand. P.F. Chang's is one of few places that will let you make a reservation, and we've always wanted to eat there.

I called about a month ahead, since we were going to be a group of 25. Easy to make the reservation, and I clarified ahead that we could do separate billing--wasn't a problem.

I happened to be in Planet Hollywood a couple days before our reservation, and clarified with them that the booking was still there. It was, and additionally, they called in the morning of the reservation day.

I was quite impressed by how they set us up. We had a private, attractive room that was closed-off and fit all of us comfortably. Service was FANTASTIC! Make sure you ask for Robin. She nearly ran our group solo, with no real hiccups. Not to mention she has the right personality and attitude to be handling a big group--she was a lot of fun and we got a real kick out of her.

The food was fantastic as well. So fantastic that we went back the next week for some (h)appy hour food and drinks.

I cannot recommend this location enough if you're looking for a charming space with good food and no fuss when it comes to booking."
"This is a nice restaraunt with an outdoor dining area. If you are there in peak times, the sun may be too much outside. 

The food is really good and the prices not too bad. The service is top notch. I ordered hot sake as I'd never tried it before. When the waitress asked how it was, I admitted it was cross between cat pee and rocket fuel from thunderbird 3. She said she wouldn't add it to the bill even though I was more than happy to pay for it. Thats classy service. 

Fully recommend a visit."
"We booked herein advance as we knew about the gluten free menu, which is a real treat for me.
From the moment we arrived, and everything in between it was excellent.
Service is great, food is really tasty and portions are good and the prices are reasonable for the Strip.
I would highly recommend eating here
Thank you for an amazing meal"
Initial service at opening was slow. But was friendly and efficient. Lunch options were ok. the food was very good
Visited Planet Hollywood location as we had early show tickets.Chose PF Chang's knowing the menu selections. Plenty of available seating pre 6:00 and decor is upscale and dining environment pleasant. Got great early bird drinks and chicken entrees w/ rice tasty. Service by our young waiter could not have been better.
"THe menu items are either near or are identical as the eateries in Honolulu (Waikiki) Detroit,  Michigan (Is where I had my virst experience with P.F Chang) and that was fantastic. It still is but....time and compromises in attention to detail takes a toll, however small. I notice it."
"Really disappointed with this location and their pricing policy. I’m a PF Chang’s Rewards Member and used the Chang’s For 2 Promotion. The promotion should have been $49.95 but unbeknownst to me you have to read the fine print since select locations can have a different price for the exact same promotion. 

After receiving the bill and complaining the manager came over to discuss the issue. She was unsympathetic simply saying they have the right to the higher price, especially since they are right on the strip. 

Long story short we were charged $59.95 vs $49.95, a 20% premium to the advertised price. If I had known we wouldn’t have ordered the promotion since it is really too much food and marginally a better deal.

Not happy ...poor pricing policy ... even worse service."
"The best of the best
Dinamet shrimp is amazing,  and red chilli butter shrimp is the top dish
We keep going there for the same dishes 
Price is expensive any dish will cost you 50-100 AED,  but quality is high even service is very good"
"Went for supper as we always have. Food was great service was ok. 
Unfortunately don’t have the shareable meals anymore. Great food."
"As expected,  the food and the service were phenomenal like every PF Chang’s that I visited. I was really surprised of the enthusiasm of the staff ensuring the order were perfect. The wait times for this restaurant are on the 50 to 60 minutes range on a week day but I guess that is normal for the amount of people they serve plus is Vegas."
"A visit to Vegas isn’t complete without a visit to PF Chang’s at Planet Hollywood.

Party of two with hearty appetites sharing 6 pan fried pork dumplings, 6 pan fried shrimp dumplings, 6 deep fried crab wonton and a bowl of wonton soup and we weren’t disappointed!  Ample portions and coming in at ~$50 total.  And of course the service was exceptional with such great friendly staff.

Hint:  Looking for a fast bite before heading out to a show?  Grab a seat at the downstairs bar or the hidden secret upstairs bar!"
"I was really torn between a few of the items in the menu... most of the menu is food I would love to try.  Being a Canadian it’s not often I get to go here but it hasn’t disappointed yet.  My waiter was really friendly, attentive and knew exactly how available to be without stepping over the line."
"P.F. Chang is all hype and no substance. If you are going for Asian food you will be disappointed. I believe the rating they currently have is based on a lot of substandard competitors in this price range along the Las Vegas strip. 

None of our food was hot when served. The spring rolls were room temperature, the green tea, and the entrees also were room temperature . You do not expect this at a restaurant like this.

What really irked me was the waiter coming with the bill and asking that I let him take my credit card with him to process the payment at another location in the restaurant. Somehow I thought that we had progressed past this with all the credit card fraud. Most premium restaurants use portable credit card machines that they bring to your table. You can now process a credit card from an I phone.

The waiter was rather indignant that I objected to my credit card being taken away and used outside of my sight. This is a practice I would expect at some mom and pop breakfast shop."
We have eaten in pf changs in various parts of America and have never been disappointed . We last ate in this one 5 years ago and once again we had a great time .. There was a small wait but they give a timer which tells you when your table is ready . The staff were very friendly and helpful and once again the food was great .. The portions are large and plentiful .. Definetly worth a visit
We stopped in for Chinese food on the strip. P.F. Chang’s takes being gluten-free seriously.  They always take care to prepare things separately and the taste is by far the best Chinese food I have eaten since being diagnosed.  The best part is that my wife loves it too.  We can both order off the gluten-free menu and be full and happy.  Great job.
"Perfect location and great food. We booked online an hour before arriving at restaurant and were immediately seated. 

Fantastic food. The restaurant was packed but this did not impact the service. Not the cheapest place to eat but great quality. 

Really enjoyed it!"
"Wife and I had an awesome meal, as always, along with superb service by Phillip. We will return again soon."
"Conveniently located in Planet Hollywood, great service, and great food.  Sat at the bar and had a great dinner experience."
This was my first time eating at a P.F. Chang’s and I was very happy with it. The service was fantastic and the food was really good. Be sure to make a reservation- it was busy! I can’t wait to eat here again. Dish to try- tempura cauliflower. Spicy but great tasting!
"Ordered 4 appetizers,  plus one for the middle between 5 of us and that ws perfect a couple of drinks and great service and we were good to go.  Highly recommended!"
"The meal we had at P.F. Chang's was one of the best we had on this trip to Vegas! We were seated at the outdoor patio and were served by Cal. He suggested trying the lettuce wraps along with the wonton soup that we really wanted to try. The filling for the wraps was delicious as was the huge bowl of wonton soup. Perfect for sharing and we were stuffed. But, we ended up managing to eat a mini strawberry cake with coconut for dessert too! Just the right size and a great way to end an amazing meal. 

The restaurant was very clean, convenient location at Planet Hollywood, reasonable prices and attentive/friendly staff. Thanks Cal."
"My wife and I were staying at the Elara Hilton Hotel, next to this place. We decided to have dinner here for convenience. Food was tasty. Service was good."
"Had dinner here one evening. We arrived just before the end of Happy Hour (3pm-6pm M-F) & were able to get in some drinks & vegetable spring rolls at the reduced price! Two ladies here, we shared an entree, sesame chicken, it was delicious & the perfect amount of food! Very easy to find this location right at the Planet Hollywood Strip entrance. Will definitely be back if we return to Vegas! Excellent service & food!"
"Right in heart of the action, so expect it to be pretty busy.
That said the service was fine and we got a table straight away.
The food was good and a welcome change from the usual burgers and pizzas elsewhere in the city."
"After a couple of days of burgers and buffets this was a welcome reprieve in Vegas!

We were seated outside at our request and even though we were in a corner we were well looked after.

We ordered the beef with broccoli and the special chicken, both came with rice and hit the spot. Portions were generous and it all went down well with a couple of house mojitos.

Family friendly and adjoins the Planet Hollywood casino for an immediate attempt to right all your wrongs from the day!"
We had dinner & drinks here. We had a great waiter & the food was good as always. We love the chicken lettuce wraps!
Chicken lettuce wraps-Highly Recommended along with chicken lo mein and honey chicken. Their cocktails are amazing too!!!!
"We went there on the11 October 2018 at 17-30 the waitress came to our table and bumped Ito another customer smashing some glasses and covering another diner with water,she was rude to the customer and unbelievably arrogant in her attitude.our meal was poor to say the least.i had changs spicey chicken,only to find a prawn in it,our waitress joked about it not realising how serious this could have been as some people are allergies to shell fish.she said that she had reported it but I doubt it.we have been going to changs for years in various cities but the standard now seems to be slippind"
PF Chang’s did not disappoint. The service was great and the food was delicious. The meat dishes are flavourful and the vegetable dishes are also great.
PF Chang is a consistent good chain to use when away or at home.  This specific one has multiple floors and patio depending upon the season you are in Las Vegas.  Great food and service every time we go here.
We enjoy the meals at PF Chang’s when in Vegas. Anything we have tried has been delicious. Put this on your list to eat at!  The lettuce wraps are excellent. We usually share 2 dishes which is just right for us.  The steak and broccoli and the seafood pad Thai was very tasty!!
"My fiancé and I really wanted Chinese on our last night in Vegas (a Sunday night) when we saw PF Chang’s while on the strip. We were tired after running around the strip all day and wanted to get it to go. We were happy to see that they had that option! Awesome. We get in line behind 1 other man and hear him order right away. For whatever reason, it took 10-15 minutes to wait for them to take his card after ordering. That’s neither here nor there, things happen, but the wait time is important. There are three other people waiting behind us as well. We get up to order and it was a big order (1 order or crab Rangoon’s, 2 egg rolls, 1 sushi roll, sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken and pad Thai), so we knew it would take a little bit for our food, but the man taking our order said it would take 10-15 minutes. We decided to drink at the bar while we were waiting. The 10-15 minutes they said it would take turned into 20... then another 10... and another 10... and another and another until an hour had gone by without anyone telling us why our food was taking so long. No one had gotten their food. The three people behind us were still waiting too, without any word. Everyone was upset at this point. After another 10 minutes, we FINALLY got our food! They said sorry for the wait, but they didn’t offer to “throw in” anything or take a percentage off for how terrible that wait was. We had no explanation either, we felt like they truly didn’t care. We spent over $100 on food and about $30 on drinks. My fiancé finally told the bar tender the next drink was on them for the wait they (clearly reluctantly) did. We were there waiting for an hour and a half. I understand we had a big order, but to wait THAT long? That’s ridiculous and terrible customer service. We felt like no one cared at all. The worst part though was we had no silverware once we got back to our hotel room on freemont and spent an extra 10 minutes trying to find some, and we spent the rest of the night fighting over the bathroom because that food did something horrible to our bodies.

This is one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. We will not be returning and I would rethink coming here for take out."
"This restaurant reminds me why I moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles California almost 20 years ago. UPSELL on everything.  Drinks, dessert, after dinner drinks, etc.  My wife and I shared.  We split a egg drop soup that was salty.  We than had a Tofu dish and the Pepper Steak platter.  The steak should be cut thinner if serving flank steak. It also had a lot of filler.

It is located in the Planet Hollywood Resort.  Kill the upsell and I might return.  The food was OK, nothing special.  Many photos added."
"Recently went to the Vegas location at Planet Hollywood. The food was good as usual. The service was also good, except that they put us at a table near the patio door so we were very hot."
"We already tried this restaurant in Long Beach and it was very good. And this one in The Strip is the same: the dim sum are gorgeous, the sesame chicken is sublime and the 5-spices tofu is very tasty. Finally the Chinese kitchen is at another level, in a chic atmosphere and a dark local. It's just very difficult to have a conversation, the noise is very high and you can't hear each other. And another problem are the prices: they are 2$ more expensive than in the other restaurants, I think for the location. But it's very good, I highly recommend this place!!"
"Went in for some lunch, was excited to go because its my favourite place to stop in when I go to vegas but my experience was terrible. Asked for the rice bowl and it was greasy and full of eggs which I asked for no eggs.
When I ordered the waitress said to me ""is that all your eating"" you sure you dont want to order more?""
She didnt bring me water,i had to ask for a glass of water.
Maybe she was new but not sure what it was but overall for what i paid it would not reccomend it.
Not sure if I will try it again ."
Great location in Planet Hollywood and near the Bellagio. Always very accommodating for vegetarians and was very pleasantly surprised with the Kung Po with Thai Tofu! The tofu lettuce wraps are always a delight but the crispy fried green beans are a must. The ladies really liked the new Blushing Geisha cocktail with Deep Eddy Grapefruit Vodka and blood orange.
Food is always good. Servers were so busy but so attentive. Accommodating to anything that we needed.
"Excellent food, freshly cooked which went well with the glass of white Chardonnay. Staff were attentive and understanding when I made them aware that I had limited time due to having to go to a show. Nothing was too much of a problem. Well worth a visit 👍"
Great place for Chinese. Went here for dinner and was not disappointed. Seated promptly and staff pleasant and knowledgeable. Had the Chinese beer and steak and peppers with rice. Yum! Great banana spring roll for desert.
"Always have the same and never been disappointed 
Mongolian beef
Northern style ribs
Sesame chicken
Fried rice combo
This place is amazing"
"We ate at PF Chang before the JLo show and sat outside on their patio, which was lovely. 

We were lucky to get the sweetest, most service oriented server, Anthony. Anthony made our dining experience exceptional. He helped us decide on drinks and food items. When he learned that it was both our birthdays, we offered for us to sign up for their reward program in exchange for a free item. 

The food was consistently delicious as were the drinks and dessert. 

Anthony is a credit to the organization and should be used as mentor/trainer of customer service. Thank you for a great evening Anthony!"
"Typical PF Changs. Just plain delicious food as always!!  This one is directly on the famous Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. We went in for dinner on a late September evening and elected to sit outside with a table overlooking the strip. Very comfortable on this particular evening. Servers were awesome and the food was great just as you would expect from a PF Changs!"
"I really liked this restaurant, it has a great style and the food is lovely. The only thing that let it down was that the food wasn't that hot. The service was great. We over ordered, there were 3 of us and we ordered 2 starters and 3 main courses and I would say you only need 2 mains as the portions are so big. Would definitely recommend. The only other disappointing factor is that we booked a table and we still had to wait for 15 minutes with a buzzer and so it defeated the object of booking."
Very basic fast food type Chinese food. Restaurant was chaotic and ultra busy with starters and mains served within 15mins of ordering. Ideal to grab a pre-show bite to eat but nothing more! Won’t go back.
Food is family style and there are lots of options for a good price. The decor is elegant and service was decent.
"As usual, PF served up perfect dishes top top off an evening in Vegas. Always excellent food. Way to go guys!"
Very nice food. Quick and good service. Particularly enjoyed the Kung pao chicken. The 2 person mai tai fish bowl almost certainly helped :)
"We visit this restaurant every year and go at least three times during a two week holiday. The service and food are exemplary and I will return next year. It’s a shame they no longer do orange peel beef, but the orange peel shrimp is amazing as is the beef schezuan. I would definitely recommend and please be aware that the entrees are huge servings."
"This is such a great spot for food and drinks! I know you might be thinking, “I can eat this in my home town” as can I BUT if you are familiar with the strip and it’s expensive prices, what you can get at PF Chang’s makes it a great food/ drink contender. First of all: Location- Being located center strip, inside Planet Hollywood makes it easy to get to and from wherever you may be coming from or headed to. Second: Food- you get huge portions, making ideal for sharing, appetizers are perfect for snacking or a small meal and hey soup is even an option if it’s all your stomach can handle after a wild night (speaking from experience of my early 20’s). Oh, and some days they even have lunch prices and they do accept coupons if you are signed up for the restaurants rewards program. Last but not least: I’ve never had a weak drink here! Prices are fair (for Vegas) AND they are SO MUCH better and well crafted in comparison to some of the random casino bars/ restaurants!"
Small PF Chang location that is quant and cozy. Not too busy or big that you get lost in bad service. We had the Chang Lobster and some Dynamite Shrimp.
"went in for a meal on our honeymoon and it's was very good.  our server Phillip was wonderful and very helpful with navigating the menu. the food was excellent. I only gave 4 stars as the main course arrived as we were still eating our starter but apart from that I would recommend and will definatley go back.
Thank you Phillip for making our evening so special x"
Excellent food service and environment this is a must when your in Vegas. Go for lunch it’s not as busy as supper or after 6pm. Located in PH facing strip
"The food  is always fresh and tasty.  I ordered Almond, cashew chicken.  It wasn't on the menu but our server suggested it.  It was delicious.  The service was just ok.  I needed a refill on my tea and it took quite awhile to get someone's attention.  We ordered The Great Wall of Chocolate for dessert..It was delicious but it would feed at least 6 people."
"The food was delicious, the ambiance is nice and comfortable and the service was really good.
We had the Mongolian beef and the shrimp with lobster sauce.
The waiter, Justin, was very kind and helpful. 
We definitely recommend."
"PF Changs is one of my favorites, but lunch at this location ended up being expensive and lacking. Drink prices were astronomical and our service was so so. While Leo was very friendly, service was slow and one of our dinners was wrong. We will go back, but on this day, they dropped the ball."
"Dinner at PF Chang’s was so delicious! Me and my friends! Service was very good, the food so delicious."
Enjoyed dinner at P F Changs 2 nights in a row. Love the food it never disappoints you. However on the 2nd night our meals were rushed and the cheque was there before we had finished the meal. Not a good look.
"Have a whole separate gluten free menu with plenty to choose from. 

Lettuce cups are a must have. 

For non gluten free - must try the dumplings, yum!!!! 

Ate here twice on my stay in Vegas as was satisfied both times!"
We ate here prior to the Lionel Richie concert. The staff was friendly and made sure what we ordered was properly prepared to our liking. It was delicious. Some of the best we have had in a long time and it was not overpriced like a lot of places are in Vegas. We highly recommend this restaurant.
This is a great place to eat. The food was awesome. Great date night.  The prices were reasonable and a great location.
"I LOVE PF Changs! Overall, we had a great service. I ordered my usual, pepper steak with white rice, the pepper steak was rather spicy but very good. Both friends had Beef with Broccoli. Conveniently located near our hotel (Marriott Grand Chateau) and inside of Planet Hollywood. We would go back again."
"Great service. Quality food. Reasonable prices. So happy to find a restaurant that has continued to maintain excellent reliable food. Server was animated and so attentive. Made for a great night when you combine yummy food, fun location and excellent staff.  Sure wish the chain was in Canada."
"This restaurant is located on the strip..close to many other attractions. Its generally a busy restaurant and requires reservation ahead. the menu is long and has many choices for vegetarians. Few tables are located with a trip view, literally. we enjoyed seeing Vegas go by! It was a good meal too."
As a Coeliac food is always an issue especially when the menu says GF and then they can deliver.  A family member ( also Coeliac) had been to this restaurant some years ago and recommended it to us.  They had a sperale menu that delivered variety and food that did not compromise the taste or quality and no complaints about the regular menus from our travelling companions.  GOOD JOB.
"Prior to a JLO Concert we decided to have dinner at PF Changs located right by Planet Hollywood. Had a short wait given the crowd and then seated upstairs (how come no elevators?). decent server Nicolas V.

We ordered salt and pepper prawns (our favorite dish), fried rice combo, chicken lettuce wraps and a glass of sweet Moscato.

Food came warm and quickly as we mentioned a show."
"P.F. Chang’s has been a Strip institution for nearly 20 years, and the dark, cool surroundings are a welcome change from the gaudy, bright Strip. Similar to other P.F. Chang’s in other areas, this one does have first & second floor seating. Kitchen will cater to special diets. Innovative Asian that’s contemporary enough; it’s never been cutting edge. But unlike other locations of this nameplate in the midst of crowds, food is high quality, seems individually prepared and staff seem to have good attitudes."
"I am travelling with my daughter who has gluten, garlic, lactose and fish intolerance. Eating out is difficult as most places don’t cater for her allergies or the food offered is unappetising.

We visited P.F. Chang's for dinner and had what was one of the best meals on our trip. Which was a pleasant surprise as it started out looking like a disaster.

We phoned to make a reservation and confirmed that they could cater for food allergies. Arrived, were quickly seated and given menu and drinks. Told the server of food allergies, and she said no trouble and went out back to check what my daughter could eat and bring back a custom menu of what my daughter could eat.

Then the bombshell. She came back and said the only thing they could offer my daughter was boiled rice.  Having been in similar situations before, I asked to speak to the senior manager (make sure it is the senior manager). 

After explaining the situation, the manager said she would check with the chef to see what he could do for my daughter, and quickly came back with a number of options. 

We ended up sharing two mains, Mongolian Beef and a Chicken stir-fry. The food was perfectly prepared, tasty and did not adversely impact my daughter.

Our server was a lovely lady and was trying to be helpful but lacked the experience to deal with an allergy condition as complex as my daughter’s. In such situations need to talk to the manager and get the chef involved."
The appetizers at happy hour are so delicious and such a great deal!  We eat at the bar there every time we're in Vegas.  Excellent service too!
We went here for a small lunch before going to explore a little. The food was amazing! You get so much for a great price on the lunch bowl menu! Very flavorful and very filling!
"Had never eaten at a PF Chang's and Chinese sounded good! Prices weren't bad, and the food was pretty good!"
Saw a show at the V Theater in the mall and had dinner here prior to the show.  The menu is quite varied and the food was very good as well.  The wait staff was also very friendly and helpful.
"We stopped here after walking on a hot day, had our son with special needs with us .  We were seated promptly and they have cozy booths.  
The food was quick and fresh and the service was fast.  She refilled our drinks several times.  Loved the kung pao shrimp and lettuce wraps. Sesame chicken was full of ginger flavor.  All very good."
My wife and I arrived around 7:00 and had a drink at the bar while we waited to be seated. Great service at the bar. Our dining  experience was disappointing. The first signs of caution was when our waiter had an attitude about my beer selection. Entrees arrived before appetizer and  were warm not hot. I appreciated the visit from the food manager and the comped appie.
"Arrived at 8:30 and seated very quickly in a booth (great spot for peeps watching) soon introduced to Charles, our server for the evening who explained the menu and what we could expect. He turned out to be very attentive to our needs, never having an empty water glass or in need of any other kind of drink. As a family of 5 we’ve all got different tastes so we all ordered differently. My order of surf and turf was excellent the steak cooked to perfection abd with a pleasing amount of lobster and prawns; the sauce added subtle flavours to the dish. The whole evening was totally enjoyable but the main ingredient was ‘Charles’ what a nice, friendly and warm person he was; totally professional, informative and interesting. His infectious grin made us all smile. Check it out, but you must ask for Charles as your server!"
"Upon reviewing ratings on Trip advisor for good restaurants in Las Vegas we chose P.F. Chang’s on the strip which is located adjacent to the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. 

The initial impression of the restaurant was very authentic, good lighting and plenty of diners which is always a good sign, however!! 

Bad points: 
Miserable front desk staff
Requested table for 5 (plates and cutlery for 4) 
Server was miserable, unhelpful and like she didn’t want to be there
Poor selection of vegetarian options 
My son requested to substitute rice with noodles for his dish (waitress said not a problem) it wasn’t as they charged us as a side dish with full price of the main meal! 
One rice side didn’t come with meal, had to wait 10 mins before they came back!
Long life noodles have fishy smell and taste
All dishes has very little flavour - overall very bland

Positive:
The host taking us to the table, very happy and pleasant 
Layout and decor of the restaurant 
The coconut mojito $11
Vegetable spring rolls appetiser 
The fortune cookies at the end

After visiting America on many occasions we should’ve known the portion sizes are sometimes excessive but wasn’t expecting due to this being a Chinese restaurant. But one dish could easily cover 2 people, and the portion of fried rice could easily have gone round 3+ as a side. 

Overall we were very disappointed in our visit, a lot of food wasted which the waitress didn’t even question. Both my son and husband were ill later on the evening which isn’t a great end to an evening. 

Our bill for 5 people was $140, my advice would be save money and go to Panda Express, better food and service. Certainly wouldn’t return or recommend!"
"We Did takeout from PF ‘s the other night . It was average . We ordered Hot and Sour Soup , the Calamari with Vegetables tempura and Kung Pao Chicken . Everything tasted good . Will give it a try again ."
You know what you're going to get with PF Chang's.  Somehow though there is something lacking the flavour or spicing department. Expect it to be crowded & busy but despite that the service works well & the food comes out rapidly.
"We ate here twice during our stay. We had Kung Pao chicken and Mongolian beef with rice, then sweet and sour chicken and chang’s Spicy chicken. Everything was delicious. Definitely recommended."
"We booked a table for two for 6:45pm, and surprisingly for a P.F.Chang, the wait for our table arriving at 6:45 was just two minutes. Nice! The restaurant did get very busy shortly after.
We were given a table on the mezzanine floor, window side, and were able to get a glimpse of the Bellagio between trees. However, the window blinds were lower down most of the time as the sunlight was very strong and in the eyes of guest at the other tables.
Our server, Miriam was terrific, helpful and friendly. We ordered the San Choi Bow appetizer, the Broccoli Beef and Walnut Shrimps as entree. The dishes were different to each other in terms of taste and texture. Serving sizes were very good. We struggled and could only eat half the beef dish."
"We had read about this restaurant before we arrived in Vegas and it did not disappoint. When we arrived there was a queue to be seated, but we see this as a good sign! It moved quickly anyway. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. He returned to the table regularly to keep our drinks topped up. Everything is cooked from scratch but we didn't wait too long for our food. The food was delicious, fresh and full of flavour.  It does say on the menu that the main dishes are family sized and ideal for sharing. They definitely are, we ordered too much! Brilliant portions for the price you pay."
"We made reservations for P.F. Chang's over the internet for a same day dinner. The service was great and we were able to sit on the 2nd level with a view. Bonus was gluten free options which is rare for restaurants that specialize in Asian food. The gluten-free combo pad thai was delicious. Great atmosphere and place to have a spot to eat in the heart of Vegas. Located within the Planet Hollywood resort, the restaurant is a conveniant location to shows at Ceasar's, the Bellagio, and in the Miracle Mile."
"We went there for dinner. The food was very good. The only negative issue to mention is that we asked beforehand if one of the dishes we wanted was spicy, and the waiter said it was not. We complained and he gave us something else to replace it. Of course we were not charged for it."
"great place with great variety and delicious taste. Words are not sufficient to describe my feeling about the ambiance food quality taste. Very good options for vegetarians also because very few options are available in Vegas for vegetarian people. it doesn't means not good for non-veg or meat eaters. It is really worth to and explore this place whenever you are in Vegas. Nice location nearby Aria resort, Bellagio , Vegas Strip."
"I would describe PF Changs as hitting the right balance between rustic and fancy, and between budgets.  The food tonight was nice without pushing the boundaries and our waitperson was okay without being great.  More importantly it was our first group dinner and it wasn’t too expensive, meaning a reasonably cheap first night."
This chain of restaurants serves well prepared dishes. Their fresh made shrimp dumplings as well as their pork lo Main are excellent. Their restaurants are large with good ambiance.
"I absolutely love PF Changs, it was our first time to the Vegas restaurant and it didn’t disappoint. The lettuce cups to start are super tasty and a great way to start the meal. Then the beef and broccoli with rice is tender and juicy. The service was a tad slow but the food makes up for it. YUM!"
The food was good and our server was really good. She was honest when she said the meals could easily serve two and advised splitting.
"We visited the Planet Hollywood location to celebrate my birthday and from the very start, our server Danyel had a very negative attitude, she actually was rude most of the meal. Ironically, she warmed up when she left the check however. Our entrees were barely warm, she didn’t ask at any point if we were there celebrating a special day, ironically we were... she just left the spicy sauces on our table without offering to mix for us, and was also very slow to greet us and mostly absent most of the meal. We visit this location several times a year when we travel to Las Vegas, but not so sure we’ll rush there next time."
This is one of our favourites but first time in Vegas. True to form it was very tasty and the service was great.
"Food service and surroundings amazing it made our trip so special. 

Must go here food was sooo tasty quick and authentic"
"We enjoyed a quick meal before a show on the strip.  Decent ""Chinese"" food and prices that aren't horrible for the strip.  Overall decent place, would recommend for a quick meal."
This is one of our favourites but first time in Vegas. True to form it was very tasty and the service was great.
"We went to Pf Chang's for dinner and our server, Peter, was awesome. He took the time to explain the menu, he gave a couple of excellent reccomendations (which was the pork dumplings, Mongolian beef and thai chicken) and he made our experience very enjoyable! The food was prompt and delicious. Definitely coming back when we visit Las Vegas again!"
First time we went it was ok but went back for the gluten free menu and gluten free omission light lager which is great but this time we dined at the bar which we found really good and more enjoyable staff and service really good would recommend
"Do not eat at pf.changs, been there a couple of times and still their chicken, pork and brussel sprouts tasted nasty, the lettuce wraps they add white noodles so they dont have to give you enough chicken ,not worth the money"
"Beautiful place. But food wasn't what we expected. Or to spicy or no taste at all, the rice is terrible.
But that's my opinion."
Calamari and vegetable tempura as well as dynamite shrimp apps were great. My honey shrimp entree was a little soggy with shrimp stuck together. The sesame chicken was very good. Ordered pork fried rice got beef instead.
We ate here for dinner and ordered our food to go. The wait staff were extremely friendly and courteous to us even tho we placed an order late in the evening. Restaurant was impeccably clean and everything tasted great! Highly recommended.
We ate lunch and had great food as usual.  We sat where we could see the strip and watch the people go by.  This is a great place to eat and I have been going to this one for many many years … every time I am in vegas.
As soon as we walked in the aroma of food made you immediately hungrier.  Service was very quick and friendly.  Place was clean and beautifully decorated.  Food was excellent and though price was not “cheap” it was plentiful enough and worth it.  Gotta treat yourself once in awhile😎
Really good food. The service was great and they cooked celiac friendly food! No reaction after the meal. The gluten-free food was cooked in a separate area.
First let me start of with saying I love PF Chang's and have been to several locations where I live. This location was exactly like the other's expect very big and two stories. The food was excellent I love the chicken lettuce wraps and beef with broccoli.The chicken lettuce wraps is enough food to eat as an entree and still have left overs. The beef with broccoli is great for two to share or eat it by your self and have left overs. I love how P. F. Chang's has a separate kitchen for gluten free dishes so no risk of cross contamination and I love that they have gluten free soy sauce giving me more options for food. My only complaint is why did you get rid of the flourless chocolate cake it was the only dessert I could enjoy on the menu being gluten free. We were eating here to celebrate my birthday and a cake would have been so appropriate.
This is our favorite restaurant on the Strip.  The atmosphere is excellent and the service always great.  Every dish we ordered to share was fantastic!
Any PF Chang’s is good and this one kept the tradition going. We started with the dynamite shrimp app. And then enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken and Beef Lo Mein with rice. Service was good too!
Ate here twice while staying at Planet Hollywood. Enjoyed both meals and atmosphere. Serving were generous (we even shared a meal).
Always see P.F. Chang's when in Vegas but never was able to try it...this time however we were able to.  The staff was friendly and know the menu. The food we ordered was right on tasty...so good!!! And the price was reasonable to us.
"Excellent service and great food.We had dinner here with our family,which included a teenager,a 4 year old and an 11 month old.We were very well attended to & the meals came out in a timely manner as well.
Would highly recommend this place."
P.F. Chang is one of our favorite resataurant here in US so we went here yesterday and had lunch. As expected they alway have a good service. Good food and not expensive.  We always order their spicy tofu and lettuce wraps.
"We were visiting Vegas for the day and after a whole day of walking under the Vegas June Heat, we found that one of my favorite restaurants were in Planet Hollywood. Not too far from where we were staying. We were welcomed by Roberto, our server. He was so nice, I felt bad asking many requests to him. After a long day walking around, Roberto was able to meet our requests through the roof!! 

Hope he is able to see this review and for other future diners at Planet Hollywood's PF Chang's, please ask for Roberto. He's a great server!!"
"Sat outside in the veals evening heat but it was good.

Of interest the size of the meals here ordering the same thing as in Indy only a few days early were much bigger and of better value the Indy branch left us hungry still."
"Here is a Restaraunt that has been around since the 90s.  Located directly on the strip and inside the planet Hollywood hotel.  

We were there at 6.  It was packed.  But we did not feel rushed.  We had quick service.  A nice table.  The food was consistently good.  More than we needed. 

We had good cocktails served quickly. 

Highly recommend"
"A group of 6 of us went for appetizers and drinks and managed to catch the happy hour. The dumplings were so good, it was a challenge sharing. We also had some spicy Shrimp sushi which was delicious.  This was my second visit here and on both occasions the waiters were excellent. Food was served quickly and was tasty."
"Well this was a great choice for our celebrations. Reasonably priced drinks by Las Vegas standards. Great large portions of fusion food and greater service. We did probably over order but never mind it was excellent. So we had a 7.00pm show in the mile mall, Changs lovely plentiful  food and service and a few gambles without going outside of Planet Hollywood. Super evening long remembered .thank you Changs for a great last night in Vegas."
"This P.F. Chang's has a very modern atmosphere inside their restaurant. It is located inside the Planet Hollywood. If you are feeling Asian cuisine, I would recommend eating here because the food is usually consistent at P.F. Chang's and the service is usually consistent as well!

The food came in fast and tasted fresh. Food is usually consistent at most P.F. Chang's and no difference this time around. You already know that Chinese food is saltier than most and oily. It also probably contains MSG which isn't bad at all, in fact, makes it more tasty! 

Had a great experience at this restaurant. Service was fast and the drinks were refilled without any trouble. They provided new silverware for each of the meals that thy served. No complaints  for me here for this P.F. Chang's"
We dined at P.F.Changs twice in Honolulu and once in Vegas and the food was always delicious and the service as well.
"I had been to the one in North Carolina years ago and my wife had never been so we went our first night in Vegas. She had the sweet and sour chicken and I had the Kung Po shrimp. 

Both meals were very good and we had so much food for another dinner the next night. 

The service was really good. 

If we are back in Vegas we would eat there again."
Ate at PF Chang’s on the strip after our vow renewal. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and was provided with a congratulations card signed by the staff. Food is very tasty and the staff is attentive and accommodating.
"Food and service was good.
Typical PF Chang's.
Not too pricey considering convenient location to Strip and in Planet Hollywood Casino."
Food was good.  Service very good.  Probably similar to other P F Changs one might encounter anywhere.  Ate lunch there.  Seated at window overlooking Las Vegas BLVD.  Good for people watching.  They offer shaded outdoor seating as well.
Ask your server before order! We order 2 dishes with appetizer. We could finished although we were starving before heading there. Food was alright. Nothing spectacular. I might be bias I expected more as am Asian.
"Seriously, check those sizes!
The portions are really quite large and our server was kind enough to let us know that - we still ordered too much but not as much as we almost did.

As veggies, our server also noticed (without prompting) that we had ordered veggie mains - he told us one of the starters we had selected wasn't veggie - and immediately cancelled that order with the kitchen.
Check EVERYTHING with your server if you aren't sure - not much in Vegas has a veggie logo next to it - unlike the UK.

Our server was fantastic - a really lovely guy who helped us greatly, he was really attentive and friendly, even though the place was heaving. This was the first time I was really happy to tip well during my stay.

The food was great, spot on for my palette - I just regret not being able to fit it all in (too big a breakfast I guess).

A great place to eat, great food, great service and a buzzing atmosphere. Recommend."
What can I say... I love this place! I always make it a point to stop here when in town. The service is always good and the food is great and plentiful!
Typical PF Changs.  Great food.  Located in Planet Hollywood. Sat outside on the strip and had great time people watching.  Very comfortable temperature.
"I had dinner at PF Chang's with a friend. We ordered a few dishes, beef, chicken, and vegetable. None of these dishes where worth what we paid for dinner. Really mediocre food.  

The rooms are decorated nicely and the bar in lively.  To me this place is not worth visiting again. There are many choices for dining out in Las Vegas. Don't eat here just because you recognize the name.  Overpriced, not worth it. Sorry."
"Advised there was one dish on the menu they could make vegan, only one! This was stated as the veg would be steamed but we could have a side of broccoli. We thought we would give it a try as we were there with another couple (non vegans). When the food came I was extremely disappointed, it literally was a bowl of steamed veg and a side of steamed broccoli, no sauce, no flavour. Would not recommend to any vegan to try this place."
"Yep....don’t bother looking for any depth in flavour with this wanna be Chinese place.

If you’ve never been to say....Asia to taste the different flavours from different locales...you won’t notice anything.  Skip my warning...you’ll be fine.

Think of it as Chinese mall food with 3x the price!"
This restaurant has very delicious plates. Ambiance was also very nice. Servants were very kind and helpful for the foreigners.
"This review is intended to cast a shining light on PF Changes because that's exactly how I felt as I was eating the first of two visits I to their nice restaurant while on my 6 day stay in Vegas. I mean my food was great the waiter even threw in 3 extra fortune cookies the food was served within 15 minutes as the crowds kept coming on and put.  You too will love it, dress up or dress down! It's awesome .  Sweet and sour chicken , shrimp fried rice, spring rolls, veggie delight. This was all I could consume and bring back to my room!"
"Service was sub par, food was ok, lots of dirty tables for a long time. Refills were slow...might have just been am off day..."
"I just got into Vegas for a family reunion and we chose PF Chang to meet. I am from Canada and my daughter flew in from Australia. I have never met such an intimidating, annoying waiter in my life. I honestly wanted to leave after his rude introduction to us. He was pushy and when we ordered water he could t believe we wanted tap water. Everything was a total upsell. The food was cold and rank as well. Avoid this restaurant and staff at all cost. Disappointing."
Back in Vegas for business. Had to find a good restaurant for vegetarian and meat eaters. P.F. Chang's was the perfect choice.  We all ate family style and it was great. Topped off by Wilson our great server. Excellent service and knowledge of the menu.  We talked for a time and ate. We were not hurried and had fun. Thank You Wilson!
"We ate here as a party of 5

We got seated and drinks within 5 minutes.

We all ordered different appetizers and shared everything was amazing but the lettuce wraps are by far the most incredible appetizer.

Mains again all different and everyone fantastic but the Mongolian beef stood out above all else.

Take away desserts ordered as the portions are so generous again fantastic. 

Service was incredible through out and was very reasonably priced for the quality worked out around 70usd pp including tip.

We will definitely be returning before we leave las vegas"
"1st place after I checked in to Planet Hollywood Casino Hotel was to go eat.
Wow, service was excellent.
The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable with the food they offer. She checks in frequently to refill drinks and asked how food was and if we need anything. Best service ever.
Food was delicious and very reasonable price. 
A must go if you visit Las Vegas"
"I already can't wait to go back next year when i am back in Vegas. I was with 7 other ladies and the service was fantastic.   I had the Beef and Broccoli with Rice so amazingly good, i am craving it right now.  I also ordered the California Roll which is made fresh and wow it was the best I have ever had."
Service was excellent really fast food fresh amazing!!! Going to definitely come back here. Really good stuff.
"Lovely tasty food and superb flavours for this place. 

Nice ambience and reasonably priced. 

Defo worth a visit and would go again."
"This was the first restaurant we visited when we arrived in Vegas. We were staying in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & were not disappointed, in fact we went back again towards the end of our holiday.
There is a nice selection on the menu, the staff were friendly & helpful & the food was delicious. If there is one reason not to give 5 stars & that is the delay in the starters arriving at different times for both myself & my wife. Mine came a full 5 minutes before my wife's which meant that my starter was already getting cold before her's arrived at the table. We didn't let this distract from the meal or quality as a whole, which is why we back a second time. Enjoy !"
On our stay we actually eat here twice cause of how good the service and the food was! I would def. tell anyone that is going to VEGAS to go and eat there !!
"Sat at the bar to order food as the restaurant was busy. Sorry, forgot to take pictures, we were starving. Had lettuce wraps among several of the dishes we ordered. Everything was good. We just wanted to mention we had very helpful service from both Jeff and Arron who were our bartenders. They both have a great sense of humor, perfect for the service industry."
We love the Excellent food and enjoy talking with all employees.  The service is always excellent and the food is hot.
"Went here for dinner, I got the ahi tuna poke and it was very good.  Hubby had mongolian beef and did not care for it.  Service was very good."
"Went to dinner here with my husband on our last night in Las Vegas. The decor and ambiance were superb. Our waiter was definitely distracted and short with us, but we found out later that our real waiter was apparently late and the other one was annoyed about having to take over his tables. Understandable. Then they delivered crab wontons and we had ordered pan seared pork dumplings. The waiter tried to argue with us that he had asked us if we ordered wonton soup and crab wontons and my husband and I both said, no we said wonton soup and dumplings. He still tried to argue but took the wontons back (we didn’t want them). The food was delicious. We ordered Mongolian beef and Chang’s spicy chicken which were both flavorful. The only real downside to the atmosphere is the noise. I don’t think the casino right outside of the restaurant had anything to do with it. I think it’s just the way the restaurant is set up that the acoustics are awful. Other than that, a wonderful experience."
"Food is good and prices are excellent for Las Vegas. Excellent service, fast and courteous. But you cannot hear yourself talk. The music is overwhelming. If the weather is nice, eat outside as the noise is not as bad."
"My husband wanted Chinese, I wanted a salad. PF Chang's satisfied us both. We started with drinks, beer for my husband, an organic agave Margarita for me. It was very good. Next, we shared the vegetable spring rolls--fresh, crispy and hot. He had the sesame chicken with a side of fried rice, I had the Asian Caesar salad. Both meals were good and far more food than we could eat."
"Came here for dinner for my step mothers birthday, we got a few dishes to share and the food was amazing. Can’t fault it. Our waitress, Jacki was an absolute star! So helpful and friendly, can’t wait to go back the next time I’m in Vegas."
"Even though this is a chain it is always good and great value for Las Vegas. This is a really popular restaurant so highly recommend you make a reservation, especially for dinner."
"I think PF Chang is going down.
The speed at which the food was brought at a busy time clearly showed that the food was already prepared in advance. Not sure how it had been waiting but the sushi were warm and tasteless. The fried squids were super greasy ... more than one could have expected."
"As a go to for lunch, cannot beat. Good quality reasonably priced. Service could have been better, however with location/ food would go back."
We did the happy hour at the bar.  The service there is exceptional.  Some of the drink and food deals were really good.  All of our food was outstanding!
I have been to PG Chang's in a different state and remember the food being quite tasty. Four of us went for dinner and we each selected a dish as well as tried a couple appies. The dishes were a great size to share without being over stuffed. The prices were decent. It was incredibly busy but it did not take long for service.
"This is by far the best Chinese I’ve ever been to, the staff were really friendly and the food was incredible, also no pressure to give a tip unlike a lot of places in Vegas! Would definitely recommend."
"Hadn't been to a PF Changs for awhile, so decided to give it a try. Wasn't busy at all, which was probably the first sign of things to come. Although our server tried her best, it seemed like they just wanted us out as fast as possible. The food was just OK and the price was reasonable; I guess you get what you pay for. I don't think that we will be back in the near future."
"If you are going here then most likely you know this is a chain. But it's well worth the visit! Food here is better then some. Great drink prices! Wine by the bottle as well. One of the best values on the strip! Cute patio to people watch. It's in front of Planet Hollywood. Nice atmosphere, nice bar, good service."
"Prepare for long queue. Quick tip: book through their web. 
Lettuce wrap is still good even though a bit sweet for my liking. This restaurant is almost always super crowded and a bit noisy because it is connected to the casino."
"Just excellent! Delicious food, fast and friendly service. We took lettuce wraps, crab wontons, orange peel shrimp. Everything was great! Highly recommended. Just make a reservation; this place is very popular and busy."
"After a long walk down the strip and restaurant ques that were over 40+ min, this place was a pleasant surprise!  The wait was less than 20 min and the service was excellent.  Our food arrived at our table quickly and it was delicious.  So many options and although a chain- the dining experience was excellent."
"Got some quick appetizers after a show, crab wantons and shrimp dumplings were very good and came in portions of 4 or 6s. Then we had the lobster and shrimp fried rice which was nice and light but came in a big portion - so I guess that’s for lunch tomorrow. 
Service was helpful and quick, location was ideal - virtually on the Strip."
"There is a variety of choices and the meals are really big. Don't over order.
The service was extremely friendly  and the fodd came out very fast. Tasty and delicious. The waitress was great in explaining what vegan options they had and didn't disappoint. Will eat here again."
"My boyfriend and I went to visit our friend working at a bar in Planet Hollywood. This was the only place right next to the bar serving food at the late hour, so we stopped in. I got a strawberry ginger margarita and a lobster sushi roll. He got shrimp dumplings and dynamite shrimp (basically a bang bang shrimp knock off). I liked my margarita but my roll tasted very off - I believe there was some sort of curry flavor in it that just didn't go well in the roll. He and I both liked the shrimp dumplings. He thought the dynamite shrimp was ok, but I was very underwhelmed with the flavor. The server was friendly, but with so many good food options in Vegas, I just wouldn't go back."
"Came here for a birthday celebration for our eldest daughter. 

Food service is insanely fast. We had our mains before our pre meal cocktails arrived!

We loved the food which was more generous in portions than expected and the staff were brilliant. But the bar clearly had some issues. Servers were very apologetic and we got a comp’d Birthday desert for the birthday girl. 

Please bring PF Chang’s to Vancouver!"
This was a good place to eat.  My wife had the shrimp and rice which was better than my spicy pork.  Reasonably priced.  I did have to request another serving plate.  My first one had sticky residue on it.  Nothing frilly but a good value.
After walking up and down the strip finally we found a decent familiar place to eat at the strip.  We were eager to eat Asian food.  2 days of American food was unbearable for us.  It is your typical asian fusion.
"Stoped in for a light lunch . Great location , great service, and the food was very good, but not the best Chinese I have ever had but still good. 

The selection for dim sum was very limited and was ok. Menu was more of a Asian theme versus a speciality place for anyone country. So more choices and a little less in quality. 

Stella nice place to eat."
"really tasty food, not a bad price for Vegas, located in planet hollywood so was convenient for our stay there, recommended"
Amazing gluten free choice - can highly recommend the Mongolian Beef and fried rice dishes. Good service.
"Food was good, but the service here is horrible. Took forever and they just talk to each other instead of taking care of customers. I am a major fan of PF Changs, but this one was bad."
Always a great place to eat.  Spent my Total rewards credits on dinner and service was on spot as usual!  Great food!
"This review is for PF Chang’s in Greenville SC at Greenridge in Woodruff Rd. I don’t know why Trip Advisor keeps placing it in Las Vegas!!  Good crab wontons!  Very crispy and delicious egg rolls. The crispy honey shrimp was both and served fresh and hot!  My husband had a new noodle dish that he liked a lot as well.  The service was a little slow due to a party of 30, but overall a positive experience!"
"We were roaming casinos and needed to stop for lunch. PF Changs was convenient. Lucky for us! We shared the sweet and sour chicken and pork lo mein and of course drinks! Food was awesome and filling. Waiter was very friendly. First time eating at Changs and will definitely go again. It's a bit noisy, so if you're looking for something intimate, this isn't the place for you. Highly recommend this restaurant."
The food was exceptional the service awesome.  Prices not bad and love this place.  Eggs rolls to die for and won ton soup awesome
I do like PFCs but I would only ever eat lunch there. In the evening this place becomes inexplicably packed as though it is the only Chinese food for a radius of 200 miles. It's fine. It's good but it's not THAT good. I recommend the Tuna Ahi.
"I’ve been here 3 times and always treated great!  They are really busy and still get u everything you need.  The food is consistently good and portions are big for what you pay.  You are not too crowded with the chairs so you can have dinner comfortably.

Wine prices are great for being in Vegas"
I have lots of favorite restaurants when I go to Vegas and P.F.Chang's is absolutely one of my must go to when visiting Vegas. Everything thing I have tried on the menu I have liked but be careful to read menu if you don't like really spicy food because some choices are very hot which I personally enjoy.
"This place has big portions, so we split the chicken lettuce wraps, and the honey chicken. Perfect amount for two with no leftovers. Food was excellent and the service was wonderful. They refilled drinks promptly and che ked on us often."
Love this place. Food was amazing and service was fast and friendly as usual. I tried something different each time and I’m never disappointed.
Always good food. The staff is friendly fast and efficient. Decor is nice but not over-the-top. We always eat at this restaurant and recommend the lettuce wraps.
"We were obligated to meet here for business on a recent trip.  All I can say is that it is formulaic.  Absolutely average and overpriced for what it is.  If it weren't for salt and MSG, it would be tasteless.   A shame that people find it representative of Asian food.  No subleties or art.  A waste of good digestive juices."
It was great eating at a Chineese restaurant where they know how to cook!  My shrimp in lobster sauce was hot and delicious.
"We both ordered salads, One would have done they were very large portions.  The salads were good nothing exceptional.  I would try some of the Asian food next time."
"Lettuce wraps, Korean beer, Signature Lo Mein, and Asian Caesar salad... all great.  Large portions, fairly priced...great service!"
"nice asian food, dim sum and other appetizers, kung pao chicken, and shrimps, everything perfectly prepared."
"we really enjoyed our meal the food and service  was excellent ,our waitress (ashley) advised us to take a bottle of the wine instead of ordering by the glass and she was proved right , my wife really enjoyed the wine ,the manageress also took time out to give us good input on places to visit , which improved our stay"
"The waiter for our table was super friendly and went above and beyond to meet our needs. The food was amazing with so much flavour and the prices were reasonable. They also provide military discount which is also a plus. We have been to pf Chang’s Vegas and London now and the Vegas one by a long shot beats London, shame the franchise cannot keep the high standards everywhere. Las Vegas pf Chang’s was brilliant and if we ever visit Vegas again it will be our go to restaurant. Thanks for the great experience"
"We hadn't booked a table and, although it was a busy Friday evening, we didn't have to wait long for an upstairs table. Service was great and the food was excellent. Big portions and as much rice as you can eat. Prices were very reasonable for a restaurant on the Strip."
"Stayed at Planet Hollywood this year and PF's is located in the casino area.  We love eating here, great choices and priced well.  We had a great server this year, Luke.  My friends ordered a california roll as they like sushi but I'm not really a fan, don't like the seaweed wrap texture and Luke said it was  the same for him and next thing you know he brought out another California roll without any of the seaweed so that I could give it a try, I actually enjoyed it and would consider ordering again.  Thank you Luke for being a great server and taking the time to chat with us and offering the California roll for me to try."
"Us 5 woman had shaun as our server and he was AWESOME!! ask for him always. the food was great as always for pf changs, and he knows how to sell a dessert."
"We have never had a bad experience here.  Food and service are always top
notch.  The orange chicken and honey chicken are fantastic.  The Kung Po chicken
was good as well - is a spicy dish.  Buddha's feast is a great vegetarian dish"
Would not allow electric wheel chair to be stored in view made us park out of sight so we could not see chair or bags we had on so we could mske sure nothing was stolen and host was rude about it. Will nevdr go there again.
We recently visited During a Valentine's shopping trip to Las Vegas.   Remember to join their club so you can order the 4 course meal for 2 for 49.95. It's fantastic!
"We ate here late on Friday night.  Service was good, atmosphere is nice and food, as always, was awesome.  the wine list was nice too."
Didn’t disappoint. Food great. Service was pretty good - not great but certainly adequate. Value is there as well. Location at Planet Hollywood is nice too.
"Good food at PF 
Been their in my last visit also
Food and ambience is good and must try prawn dynamite"
"My friends parents were adamant on coming to this restaurant after the super bowl last weekend. I went along hoping for vegetarian options. They did provide vegetarian options but were extremely limited - even their ""vegetarian spring rolls"" had oyster sauce in them I was informed upon ordering them in which I had to switch to something else - oyster sauce is not suitable for vegetarians. I was extremely disappointed by the lack of variety, I ended up with a bowl of fried rice for dinner and that was all as the only other option I could have gotten, I wasn't a fan of the main ingredients. The service was good however but I would not visit here again. My friends mother ended up becoming quite sick from the meal later in the evening."
"No drinks , had an appy coupon with 2 main dinners under 40 dollars, food was fresh and good service. Table and dinnerware were clean (which is not to be taken for granted in Las Vegas)."
I have visited the PF Chang in West Chester Ohio several times over the last 5 years and the services have always been spectacular. Especially the service at the bar. The severs are very attentive and pleasant to order and knowledgeable and honest about new items. Great place to unwind
Really tasty gtreat food.  Fast Srrvice.  Busy place go early.  Beef & Brocoli ans Seafood Rice was excellent .  Go here !!!
"Located inside Planet Hollywood Casino, this place has been a must stop when we stay at PH.  For us, we usually hit up their separate to-go area, just inside the doors to your right.

Sadly, I don’t have my itemized receipt, so I can’t give specific prices.  I am sure you can find it on their website!  I am just too lazy to link it.  😎   In general, I think their prices are similar to slightly higher prices here locally in NH, but the quality is also better.

We’ve never had a bad meal here and add on the convenience factor, you can not go wrong!"
"This is a chain restaurant... and quality is not necessarily to same as others in the chain.  Prices are much higher... because it is located on the strip... as part of Planet Hollywood.  It's ok for a change, or a quick meal."
"Every time we come to Vegas, P.F. Chang's is a must for us. The location couldn't be better, the food and cocktails are delicious (good vegetarian options), the service is super friendly and professional. Can't wait for our next visit!"
"We ate at PF Changs located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel.
We thought that the food was delicious. It was served hot as it should be. 
Our server was very attentive and eager to satisfy us.
Being that it was my birthday he ( the server) surprised me with a complimentary birthday dessert and wished me a very happy birthday. 
Very professional!!"
"My favorite chain restaturant........I'm always happy to eat at PF Changs at the Planet Hollywood.
Service is always good and the food is good."
"We ate here after a wedding.  When I called to make the reservation, once they found it was for a wedding, they gave us a private dinning room.  It was excellent.  The food was amazing and some of the best I've ever had.  The waitress was also amazing and made sure we were not only taken care of, but that we were entertained as well.  I will definitely return anytime I'm in Vegas."
"While in Las Vegas I usually tend to over indulge at restaurants.
My second night there, I decided I wanted something light.
Walked over to P.F Chang’s. (Yes, I know it’s a chain restaurant)
I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and BBQ ribs, food came-fast,and was the perfect amount. Very tasty. 
Restaurant is loud to begin with but the music was overbearing. Not sure why they feel loud music adds to your dining experience. Guess that just Vegas."
We enjoyed our dinner selections. even had enough to take home. The service was friendly and attentive. The only not so nice thing was the level of noise which made conversation a bit difficult. It may be in a casino but enough removed that one would expect a bit less noise.
Great selection of food as usual dynamic prawns were excellent. Good selection of wine in the menu at very reasonable price. We had a great time.
"I'm less than a  chain restaurant fan but this is terrific food and service ... carry out is easy too ...

most importantly, if you have any issues, the manager will be HAPPY to attend to all your needs ...

this is a restaurant one frequents over and over again"
"My first visit to PF Chang's was very good, the food was fresh, hot, portion size good, service amazing, which made us do a second visit during our stay in Vegas. Second visit was very disappointing with regards to food. Soup was cold, sent back and re served cold 2 times, had to cancel, rice under cooked, chicken in lettuce wrap tasted bad, less salt in noodles. 

Overall thought it would have been safe bet but it wasn't. It may be a different chef/cook during our second visit. Not sure."
"I was working in Las Vegas and decided to gamble and eat at the Planet Hollywood. I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat so as I walked up to the PF Chang's restaurant I seen that it was busy and the people seemed to be enjoying their meal. I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food I ordered, the portion size and the price...all good! I will absolutely eat there again. Thank you"
"Stop to grab a quick meal. Amazing service by our server William. The food as always was great.

We had lettuce wraps and Mongolian beef very good meal"
"We've been to many PF Chang restaurants in many places, including Miami and Santo Domingo and always happy leaving them. Kind of a safe bet.
This was different. The hot and sour soup tasted a bit strange and it turned out to be bad as my wife got sick afterwards. The lettuce wraps we both had tasted very different from what we expected, not too bad but something was not right. The California roll I had was mushi, not tasting bad, but not well made and not what I expected. 
The only thing we were happy about was the Tsingtao bottled beer.
No, PF Chang's in Las Vegas will not get another visit from us. 
The food was lousy, but the service was acceptable, but not great."
Always a favourite for us as the food is good with great portions.  My husband and son got the extra large beer and loved the take home cups.  A great memory
With many expensive restaurants in Las Vegas it's sometimes good to go to a low key place with freshly made food at great prices
"We ate dinner here and loved it. Our waiter was nice and for those with any allergies like me, there is a whole menu explaining what ingredients are in which dishes - super helpful. Good drinks, good food, good service. We would eat here again."
"Have eaten at this restaurant many times;  food selection good, service usually good, and a good option if not dining on the strip"
"My husband suggested as had eaten in one in Mexico City and raved about it,so I thought ok give it a go.

It was amazing, service was quick and chatty made you feel welcome.

We had Mongolian beef spicy chicken and garlic beans, well this was by far the best meal I have had in a long time.

Will look forward to my next visit somewhere in the world x"
PF Changs is so good that we visited twice in two days! We had the surf and turf and the fillet mignon. Both were very flavoursome and cooked to perfection. The restaurant has happy hour mon - fri 3-6pm  on beers and certain cocktails which was another sweetener to the experience. We would definitely recommend!
"Had a terrific dinner on our first night. Had played all day and were starving and, even though they are very popular and have a wait, they were efficient at getting us seated. Crispy green beans are to die for and the wait staff was excellent!"
"I have eaten at P.F. Changs in Las Vegas a couple of times but I'm pretty sure that this will be the last time.  It was a convenient stop since I had just arrived in Las Vegas and I was staying at Planet Hollywood.  I was able to get a table easily and the server was friendly and helpful but the food was mostly tasteless and with all the choices in the area, I'd be hard pressed to go there again."
"Always stop in at least once to Pf Changs at Planet Hollywood on visit to .Vegas.It never disappoints.  Introduced wife's parents for first time and they loved it.Ribs are terrific. Then variety on honey shrimp, beef schezaun and  Kung Pao chicken. ALL COOKED TO PERFECTION.Service was spot on."
This is one of my favorite places to taste Chinese food. Just try the cuisine. Location is on the strip and close to the better places in town.
"Usually very good...flopped this night!!!!
Sat at the bar as I usually do. Food items as well as glasses and utensils were left in front of me for at least 15 minutes. Once cleared I had to ask the bartender to wipe down the bar-top in front of me!!!!  

Got a drink quickly. Had to wait another 15 minutes before any of the bar waitstaff (3 of them) even looked in my direction to get an appetizer ordered. Chicken lettuce wrap came. It was good. 

The manager (apparently that’s who he was) took the order of the couple sitting next to me who wisely ordered their entire meal (appetizer, drinks, and meal) after my experience. 

Soon after the manager returned to take my dinner order after realizing the fact that I had been sitting waiting...for so long!!

Beef Schezwan came. It was good. 

Sooo...food was ‘good’. Service was deplorable...!  Apparently all new help!  I cannot express how bad the service was!

And...it’s not even ‘season’ down here yet!"
The food was excellent and the view of the strip from the upstairs dinning was great. The customer service is some of the best on the strip.
"It's Christmas, the roads and shopping center were crowded and this place was like an oasis.  Ate with a huge party.  All of our orders were accurate, prompt, and hot.  The food was outstanding, particularly my Buddha's Feast and wok-seared spinach.  Service was fast, attentive,  but not intrusive.  Could not ask for a better experience!"
"With the size and how busy the restaurant can be, one expects the service to suffer a little bit. But this is not what we experienced at PF Changs Vegas. The crispy fried beans and the black pepper chicken were absolutely delicious. I really enjoyed their mojitos as well."
"My first trip to a PF Changs in like 8 years.   I thought it was okay.... worth the price paid (taking into consideration the Strip prices) and service was actually good.  I just found the 2 items I tried to me mediocre.  The Crab WonTons were exceptionally bland, and the Chicken Pad Thai, while a huge portion, was more Sweet than Spicy....and I even asked for it to be more Spicy than their norm.  Good drinks, and service as I sat at the bar and the 3 bartenders team-worked my entire dinner."
"This PF Changs is attached to the Planet Hollywood and Casino & Resort Hotel. Since my sister and I are a bit sensitive to smoke, we sat outside. Great choice to people watch on The Strip while waiting for food. 

Service and timing were great even though we went at a peak time, we were sat down immediately upon arriving. Usual PF Changs quality standard on food and service. Great experience."
"I had not been to a P.F. Chang’s in years and really was not impressed the last time I went but this time and this location is absolutely amazing!  I tried so many dishes that I would never in my life have picked myself from the menu but am so glad my colleagues did and recommended I try!  I can’t wait to go back to have some repeats and try some more now things!!! The sushi is good, the appetizers are good and the main dishes are good...everything was just so good!  Definitely a new favorite place of mine!"
"I visited on a very busy Friday night.  I did not have to wait for a table.  I was given a table right away.  With it so busy, I thought I'd have to wait for service.  That was not true.  Three different servers shared the responsibility, so I received the best service.  I had the egg drop soup and shrimp Lo Mein.  Very Good.  I was by myself, so if you visit in a group go early or call ahead for a reservation."
"The service was great. the food was even great, the menu maybe small but all the food is Delicious.They get very busy very quickly."
The food is consistently good and plenty of it. We had spare ribs and rice. For dessert they give you a fortune cookie with cream in between that is delicious.
"Visited PF Chang’s twice on our trip to Vegas. Great for allergies, tasty food and lovely friendly staff. Never had to wait for a table either which was pretty surprising."
"We have been to Changs on numerous occasions. The restaurant was really busy, we had to wait for a table albeit only 10 mins. The food was gods however we thought the Mongolian Beef and Orange Peel shrimp were a bit dry and would have benefitted from some sauce. Not as goods a Red at the Wynn"
We were seated very quickly.  Food and drinks were really good.  I highly recommend the dragon sushi roll.  It's a california roll with seared ahi tuna on top.  So good!
"We were expecting slow service and food not quite up to standard, because this is Vegas and it’s Thanksgiving weekend! Not a bit of it! We didn’t have to wait for a table. Service was prompt and the food was very good. We shared ribs as an appetiser and then had the shrimp with melon for me and Chang’s spicy chicken for his lordship. Our server was Ray. He was attentive but not too much. All in all we had a lovely evening."
"Excellent as always, in other restaurants (like in Laval, Quebec) and in addition:  the view directly on the strip!"
"I ordered what was purported to be ""Wok-Fired Filet Mignon."" Since I usually have filet mignon at home or at a restaurant at least once a week, I consider myself a connoisseur of this premium cut of beef. I took one bite and had to remove it from my mouth. It definitely did not taste like filet mignon. I asked my dining companion to try a piece and she came to the same conclusion, also removing it from her mouth. I called over the waiter and asked him to take the platter back. He apologized and had the manager come over to the table. She assured me that I wouldn't be charged for this and it was removed from the check. I also told her that I'd lost my appetite and did not want a different main course.

We had started out on the outdoor terrace, since this was an unusually warm November day. When the bright sun got into our dining guests' eyes, we asked to be seated inside the dining room. Our waiter asked us to follow him with our plates, silverware, and glasses. He didn't even offer to help us. Incredible!

To further add insult to injury, we had to either summon our inattentive waiter or a busperson to periodically refill our glasses.

Up until today's visit, we would look forward to having a meal here every time we would travel to Vegas. Never again!"
Even at 10 pm PF Chang’s delivers great food. We had no problem getting in and seated then the service was quick. Always a fan of the egg rolls and lettuce wraps.
"We love this chain and this was not different at all. Good portions and all tasty. 
Service is great and Audrey was very nice and kind. 
Could be cleaner, however..."
This is the first time that we ate at the upstairs bar.  It is calmer and quiet with a nice big TV screen for sports.  The food was as excellent as always.
"We waited despite the restaurant being 60% empty.  Food was mediocre and high priced.  No lunch menus on the weekend.  Dinner entrees do not include soup or salad.  Service was extremely slow, had to ask several times status of our food."
"Too much conference time, left and went to the bar. Can’t remember bar guy but he was good. Apps and wine were fine."
The food and service were good.  Server was extremely nice.  We were seated in the upstairs of the restaurant where it was nice and quiet.
Not to the level we've come to expect from PF Chang's.  Service was fine.  Lettuce wraps were good.  Mongolian beef and surf and turf were just okay.  Seating was comfortable.  All together in between 3 and 4 but the food did not warrant a 4.
"Out of desperation and against all my usual instincts, my brother and I️ decided on this after we got tired of looking for a legit Chinese, Thai, or Vietnamese place. We didn’t have but 4-5 hours for our only night left on our trip so time was of the essence. Other than occasional fast food, I️ never eat at a chain restaurant whether at home and definitely not on vacation, but I’ve had PF Chang’s once before and although it wasn’t my favorite, it was decent. However, this was the worst Chinese food, and quite possibly restaurant meal I’ve had in 20 years. We were starving so we ordered a lo mein, a beef dish, and a shrimp dish thinking we could always take the leftovers back to the room after an evening of gambling. Chinese, and East Asian food in general is probably my overall favorite food type. Not only did I️ not eat more than 2 bites of each dish, we left $30 worth of food on the table instead of taking it with us. The building is nice, and the server was fine, but that’s it. It was as if they bought the food at Wal-Mart on the frozen food aisle, then microwaved it."
This used to be our go-to staple when visiting Vegas. This last visit was awful. The food seemed to be lower quality and inconsistent from our other visits. We will likely not go back.
"During Happy Hour ( till 6 pm when I was there) I had the largest appetizer ever- fed me for two days!  I had lettuce wraps and when I was full the waiter did a stupendous job of providing me with fresh lettuce, sauce in a plastic container and plastic silverware and EVEN a fresh fortune cookie in my take home bag.  Because of his attention to detail I ate there twice more during my week stay!  The entire bar staff was exemplary - everyone was waited on quickly , bills paid promptly and questions answered as to the strip.  Hats off!"
"The food here was the best food I had on my entire trip to Las Vegas. Delicious! 

The server was quite friendly and helpful and made good recommendations. The atmosphere was quite enjoyable here. Would recommend you try it."
"We ate here on our 1st nights stay in Vegas @ Planet Hollywood. The food was excellent. We had the salt & pepper prawns, combination rice, & Mongolian beef.  I will be returning & looking forward to eating here again. Service was a +."
"Have visited several PF Change before and Thai was favourite. Nice varied menu, staff knowledgeable on menu and choices. Delicious and fairly priced, would definately be back."
Our service was probably the worst we had whilst we were in Vegas. We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks. The food was ok but nothing to write home about.

"Stopped here late night for appetizers and ended up having the best service and food. We were celebrating a wedding,anniversary and birthday. It was almost closing time yet they never hurried us and were extremely good to us. Would definitely recommend"
"The caption really says it all.  I had Pad Thai and my wife dined on Crispy Honey Chicken.  After a somewhat lengthy wait, both selections were hot and were plentiful."
"Firstly, the restaurant location was the best I’ve been in on the strip.  Nice view overlooking the strip but far enough back to enjoy your meal in peace.  The restaurant is modern and well set out.

Didn’t book but it was only a 20 minute wait to get a table. 

Had one course but it was nice enough.  Went with the beef fillet with rice.  It was medium rare which was borderline for me.  They could do with asking how you would like it served.

The waiter was annoying by interrupting all the time to check everything was ok.  

You felt rushed to finish so they could get the table back."
"Very disappointed.  Our waitress was obviously having a bad day.  Service was terrible.  Our drinks sat on the bar about 10 feet away for about 15 minutes if not longer.  Food very greasy and luck warm.  The shrimp dumplings were terrible as were the crab wontons.  The chicken lettuce wrap was not the usual taste the California Roll was the best choice and the Crispy Green Beans were greasy 

The only attention the waitress gave was to circle the tip calculations at the bottom of the check.  I guess you call that attention to detail

Would not return"
"Had show tickets so had appetizers of lettuce wraps and crab won tons.   Of course, when we saw the mini-desserts we ordered them too.   Every thing looked good, tasted great and the service was wonderful."
"Visited this place on our first night in Vegas and ended up going there every night.
Good service they always find you a table. Service is quick and efficient. We did our usual sharing a meal between two as the portions are always generous. Nice atmosphere not as noisy a some places in Vegas"

We didn’t have but 4-5 hours for our only night left on our trip so time was of the essence. Other than occasional fast food, I️ never eat at a chain restaurant whether at home and definitely not on vacation, but I’ve had PF Chang’s once before and although it wasn’t my favorite, it was decent. However, this was the worst Chinese food, and quite possibly restaurant meal I’ve had in 20 years. We were starving so we ordered a lo mein, a beef dish, and a shrimp dish thinking we could always take the leftovers back to the room after an evening of gambling. Chinese, and East Asian food in general is probably my overall favorite food type. Not only did I️ not eat more than 2 bites of each dish, we left $30 worth of food on the table instead of taking it with us. The building is nice, and the server was fine, but that’s it. It was as if they bought the food at Wal-Mart on the frozen food aisle, then microwaved it."
"Had a quick dinner at bar before A great concert. 
Met couple from MI, and had a nice conversation.  Good service!"
"No matter what town or city we are visiting if there’s a Changs in town you can bet we’re gonna go maybe even more than once.

Every dish on the menu is made to perfection 
The wraps, sea bass, kung pow all absolute musts
Tell them J sent you"
"This restaurant is one of my  wife and my to do's in LAS.  The food and service has never disappointed.  

Make sure and ask for a window view, preferably on the second level.  But wherever, watching the people passing by is very interesting."
"Are here a few times while staying in August. Service was always great and the food was fabulous.
Reasonably priced.
Nice atmosphere"
We stayed near Planet Hollywood and were looking for a place to have our last supper in Vegas. Food was really good and fast. Service was very good as well.
Excellent preperation of food and solid service.  They get busy but have two levesl of seating.  Drinks reasonable and solid preperation of all the entrees we ordered.
Walked in and had fast service. We are both vegetarians and we had two main dishes with great tastes. I surely recommend this place.
We were short of time and we were lucky to get dedrick for our server. Always super food. Dandelion tea and super lettuce wraps. They were out of broccoli bad news but great meal and great service.
"10 of us chose to dine here on Oct 1st, 2017 around 10pm. This was the night of the LV mass shootings.  The evening was going well with good service until a swarm of panicked people ran through the restaurant fearing guns.  Tables were knocked over, we were instructed to get under tables....it was scary BUT BUT BUT....the team at PF Changs were incredible.  They guided us down to the basement and sheltered us.  They were courteous and professional.  On my next trip to Vegas I will be stopping by to eat here and to personally thank whomever I can for the safety and security the attempted to provide us. Thank you PFC team."
We ordered dishes to share which were very good with the won ton soup being exceptional. Great atmosphere and service.
"I ate an early dinner with a friend here and had the sesame chicken which was wonderful.  I was famished and even though the portion was generous, I was able to devour the entire meal.  My friend had egg rolls for lunch and a beef dish for supper and she enjoyed the meals as much as I did.  The service was good.  My entree and soda came to $20.  I did notice that the restaurant was getting fuller as our meal progressed.  I don't know if they take reservations, but it might be a good idea if you don't want a long wait for an evening meal.  It is right in Planet Hollywood and was close to the hotel we stayed at.  I would love to go back!"
"Had lunch there twice during our visit, and at least once the last 5 times in Vegas.  Love the food.  Perfect location.  Looking forward to our next visit."
"Love the lettuce warps. They are a meal in themselves, tasty with a hit of heat. Service was fast and attentive; prices are reasonable for a Vegas eatery. Large menu offerings. Here for lunch between educational programs, so the speed of service was appreciated. The server checked several times to be sure I was okay.  Have eaten at PF s all over the USA, and this facility continues the tradition of fine food and fine service."
This is a must experience. Just follow the crowd as it is very popular restaurant right inside Planet Hollywood. The lettuce wraps are really good and really different. I am certain you will enjoy this dinning experience.
"Visited here on holiday and had a nice meal. Very busy place and glad we booked online. We tried the highly recommended chicken lettuce wraps but they were just ok, pretty messy but the main meals we had were the Singapore black pepper chicken and the wok fried filet mignon and they were very nice large portions and we struggled to finish them and were big eaters. Definitely recommend but maybe leave out the starters."
"Service was top notch, food was fresh, portions perfect, price was fair.
All around good time.
The Mongolian Beef was wicked awesome"
"The featured ginger beer was a perfect non alcoholic beverage to enjoy on my husband's 40th birthday. Pf changs never seems to disappoint me, and las vegas location was no different. The service was great, the food was fantastic."
"Located right at the strip it's a reputed chain for chinese food in Vegas.
Food was ok, we got steamed dumplings, Kung Pao prawns and rice for lunch between 2 persons, portion size was good.
Our waiter was very greedy asking for too much tip and got our order wrong.
Overall experience was good."
"We always go to PF Chang's when we are in Vegas.  The food is consistently excellent, as is the service.  Sit in the bar at happy hour for some great deals!"
"Came here on a recommendation from a friend. So glad we did, booked a table & i'd advise to do this as the place was heaving! Ordered food, 2 x ribs to start (One portion would be enough) 6robs per portion doesn't sound much but they're good sized & very tasty. Ordered mains & we ended up getting food boxed up to take back, as the portions are big! Good service, reasonable priced, we actually saw the friend who recommended it in there on the same night!! Deffo a must if you like a quality Chinese."
"We went to PF Changs in our hotel for lunch at 11:30AM. We were two of maybe 20 people in the whole restaurant so I'd imagine is nowhere close to what they get in there on any given day/time. We asked to be sat on the patio where there was 4 other tables also sat. We waited 15 mins before a server finally came to ask for our drinks, even though a few passed by our table going back and fourth to other tables. When the waiter finally came we ordered our waters and our food. He did bring our drinks out promptly but then by the time our food came we had empty drinks...which by the way the waiter (who was not our waiter) didn't fill them. Finally someone passed and we could ask for a refill. The food was mediocre at best, service was absolutely horrible, and we would never go back."
"PF Changs is my must visit when in LV
Great food, lively atmosphere and friendly staff.
We sat upstairs which is a little quieter and were well looked after. Can recommend the soups and orange chicken is particularly good.
This place is always busy!"
"Decided to have dinner here since it was close to the hotel. Food was good, and service was also very good."
"Went together with a group of about 10 business colleagues, we have been before and we will go again, the food was what you expect, great, clean food!"
"Hadn't been to Vegas in about 3 years, so a return visit had us looking forward to Changs as it used to be a favourite of ours. I have no complaints about the quality of the food or drink, prices are average for Vegas now, but I found the attitude of the bar staff serving on my visit particularly bad , to the point of being offensive. I observed one of the female bar staff roll her eyes when serving a customer, who I think had been asked if she wanted more ice or fruit in her drink, and quite politely had agreed, fortunately she did not see 
the roll of the eyes when the female bar staff employee turned away. This same female staff member stated quite proudly to her male colleague that she ""even got a 5 dollar tip for her sarcastic manner"" when she had served 2 males, who had also been seated at the bar. To me, it appeared as if the staff especially the two females who were on shift at the time, were doing the customers a favour and they couldn't care less whether you had an enjoyable experience or not. 
Don't know why Changs think this form of customer service is acceptable, certainly not an experience I want to repeat."
We checked in our hotel very hungry and tired from a day of travel and we stopped at PF Changs.  It was very good and the service was quick.  We got 4 eggrolls and chicken fried rice a coke in a refillable cup.  The refills were free for coke and Tea.  The total was $38 dollars.  A bit expensive but the refillable cup was $6.  It was worth it.  We used the cup a few times during our stay at Planet Hollywood.  Be prepared for higher prices than you are used too.  But the food and the service were great.
"We have a routine , fly into Vegas at about 7:00pm check-in head to PF by 9:00  chow down and we off , ambiance, food and service always top shelf. Our waiter ( Slick Nick) was great.  See you guys soon"
Very nice!! 1 starter and 1 main is enough for 2 people. Would go again. Staff are friendly too and nice environment.
"We visited prior to seeing a show and we all left happy and full. Its not my first visit and wont be the last. The Mongolian beef is amazing and a good selection of wines too. If you havent been before, just remember to shate your dishes or you will be ordering too much."
"Totally happy they didn't disappoint.  Everything was great!  I've had my fair share of PF Changs. I'm picky, don't eat onions, bean sprouts, etc.  I didn't have to send anything back because it wasn't made as requested and everything was hot."
Dropped in for happy hour. Great deals. Had chicken lettuce wrap big serving fresh. Crab wonton crispy not greasy. California rolls fresh. Service was great.
"OUTSTANDING.  DINNER,BOOZE AND SERVICE .  VERY REASONABLE! Definitely will return.  Been to several in many states.  Never had a problem. ..."
Really great food and service.  Reasonably busy so good atmosphere and perfect for a quick dinner.  Solid menu options and the lettuce wraps were out of this world and definitely worth a try!  Not bad value for money
"Was looking for the Rain Forrest and had a very hard time finding it, and then the elevator was not working so we stopped at PF Changs instead, and I'm glad we did.  The service was great  and the food was yummy. We had 2 23 month olds and a 6 yr old and the waitress was very nice and made sure the food was delivered fast."
We had some great food here. We sat outside just at the side of he strip which was great and you could see everyone going last and watch the lights etc. Great place.
We came to the mall after the State Fair to do some shopping and decided to have a drink and a quick bite.   We ordered the lettuce wraps and two martinis.     Service was awesome and the lettuce wraps were awesome.   The drinks absolutely wonderful.   We have never had a bad experience at any PF Changs.
"Had a look at the menu and lots of choice so booked a table on a busy Saturday night (Mayweather vs McGregor). Got there 5 mins before the booking and seated straight away. Ordered an appetiser and a number of entrees. They brought them all out at the same time, we ordered chicken pad Thai and they brought us shrimp and chicken pad Thai so they took it away and brought it back. Ten to fifteen minutes later.........it smelt really bad, suspect they used to much fish sauce, made my stomach turn. They did take it off the bill but not a great experience, not cheap and also no restrooms in the restaurant, I would go back as the choice is good and some of the food was great but would lower my expectations beforehand"
I have eaten at this PF Chang's numerous times and have never been disappointed. Being gluten free they always have good alternatives for us and make it very clear which dish is good to go. Their rewards program is also good where you earn points to get up to a free entree and a free appetizer/dessert for your birthday. I'm sad that they cycle out some of the dishes I have loved in the past but they do bring other tasty good new ones as well. Easy location being right on the strip at Planet Hollywood with a patio in the decent temperature months to use for additional seating.
Ate here several times during our trip. Good service and great food! Loved the lettuce wraps and decent prices.
"Food was very nice - had the sweet & sour chicken. Prices seemed reasonable for on the strip, same for the wine prices

Worth asking for a table upstairs, some have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains which is good when eating!"
"The PFC we went to was a stand alone building in Henderson we went to avoid casino traffic and crowds, which I recommend doing. If you have never been, you should go, you will be pleased. If you have been to a PFC before you will be pleased. They are all about the same and that's a good thing. I love it."
"We sort advise from the trip advisor reviews and opted for P.F Chang's near planet Hollywood and we weren't disappointed. The service and food was excellent, however so were the portion sizes so please consider sharing , especially if like us it was the first night after a long flight."
"For great chinese food P.F. Changs is always a good call.  this may not be a truly genuine old world Chinese Cuisine, but the food is always high quality and service quick and thorough.

if you are going for dinner, i recommend reservations, even if you make them the same day, or shortly before you arrive, you will not be disappointed."
"Went for dinner with the wife on Sunday Night here at PF. Changs @ Planet Holywood Hotel / Casino.. 

Service was fist Class (we were looked after by Jeremy) always made sure we had everything we needed, was very quick to refill our drinks, very polite and his food recommendations were Brilliant..

We ordered the Mongolian Beef & the Sesame chicken.. 
both dishes were absolutely outstanding.. really really tasty, such Big portions - the beef was pretty much a fillet steak sliced up - so very very tender and juicy with so much flavour and not a bit of fat.. 
chicken was really really good, although the wife ate the majority of that.. 

Anyways we left after finishing up and said to each other - that's our Number 1 meal so far on our trip. 

Definitely will be back for more.. possibly tonight 🙈😜"
Quick and friendly service received. Good range of different tables available. Disappointed that they no longer do the veg dumplings anymore!! Not much starter choice for vegetarians. Some good offers available for the happy hour times. We enjoyed our food. Possibly not enough rice given with main dish. The portion sizes are huge and fairly priced. This is my husbands favourite restaurant in Vegas! Worth a visit for sure!
"Want a quick, easy, tasty meal. Here ya go. Service is always great. Food is always good. When your not going for that ""new"" vegas eatery experience, or you want a meal you won't have to go take a nap after, here ya go."
"P.F. Chang's caters to a Chinese food lover willing to pay a bit more for their take on classic Chinese dishes. This particular restaurant is in Planet Hollywood and can be busy, very busy. However, every time I have visited we had a seat in short order. The food is good, service great, and priced a bit higher than your average Chinese restaurant."
"I sat at the bar and had the mogolian beef, very good! had a red wine glass as well. Service is good."
"Great place, great atmosphere, great staff. We started with the BBQ ribs, which were out of this world. I then had the pad Thai on recommendation from our server(Phillip, who was absolutely fantastic). If you love Chinese and are in Vegas this is the place to go. If you get Phillip as your server you're in for a great night. Really can't sing his praises enough."
Excellent service  i had dinner with my friend last week very good food.I love the food.and staff were very caring.i love to visit again.
"Been twice this vacation and previously ate in Monterey! The food is absolutely stunning!. Served by Kyle with no fuss. We love the Mongolian beef and Lo Mein with chicken. The flavours are stunning, portions are huge and it has to be our favourite place to eat in Vegas!., Service is quick and efficient and makes for enjoyable dining experience!."
"Great place to eat chinese food, conveniently located on the strip. Very friendly staff, excellent food.. 
Love the mongolian beef, prawn & chicken dishes.. 
Easy on the wallet.."
"We went for a family dinner and whilst it was busy we're seated straight away. 

Lettuce Wraps and Dim Sum to start and Pad Thai, Sweet Sour Chicken & Chilli Chicken (can't remember the name!)

The food is fantastic with great attentive service and also reasonably priced ! 

You can't go wrong !"
"I am a sucker for spare ribs so you can imagine how my eyes lit up when I saw that  P.F.Chang's had them on their menu. There are a large variety of dishes to choose from. 
The restaurant is quite loud and there is a huge Fluctuation of guests but nevertheless my friends and I had a very enjoyable evening. Oh it also does takeaway's & it's within  walking distance from a lot of the  Hotels. We will return."
"Located in the Planet Hollywood casino this well known chain of restaurant is still a marvel.
Great food. Had the shrimp with candied walnuts and honeydew for the 1st time and it was to die for. Plus all our favourites of course...
Staff excellent!
Price great!
Love it!"
"We booked a table for 8:45pm, just after a 7pm show we went to in Planet Hollywood and it's just across from the Cosmo where we were staying.  We were glad we booked  as this place was busy and there was a line waiting.  We were seated quickly and our server, Justin, was great - advising on dishes and just attentive in general.  I had the Asian Mojito (I think that's what it was) & it was great & my husband got a beer.  We got the Lettuce Wraps, Spare Ribs and Dynamite Shrimp to start, then had the Mongolian Beef which was delicious as well as Sesame Chicken - which I thought was ok - think I'd go for a beef dish if I was going again.  Kids had two kids meals which were good sizes.  We had leftovers so Justin boxed them all up for us and the kids ate some the next day when they were peckish.  Enjoyable meal - was just $112 + tip."
"Called in with friends on Saturday for lunch,10 of us in total and the service,food and drinks were excellent as usual most of us had eaten on numerous occasions and it never fails to impress and although Vegas feels expensive due to the week pound I must say it still felt good value for money"
"Went there late night snack, asked for the servers recommendation. Spicy chicken and chicken noodles. Both were sweet and over priced. But location I guess but it's okay. Place is jam packed at late night. 
Mostly tourist. When my spicy chicks came out lol it was orange chicken."
Us four went for dinner in Planet Hollywood. Wonderful food selections and priced very well. Service personnel very accommodating and helpful. Portions were awesome and the drink specials were good. Enjoyed by all
"We stayed at Planet Hollywood and so we ate an early dinner here.  Had specials on appetizers and drinks until 6pm. Got the Lettuce Wraps, which are always good.  Can still get Cashew/Almond Chicken, but it's not on the menu. Food was good, service was good, atmosphere was good!"
I eat at PF Changs every time i'm in Vegas and this was the first let down.  Prices seemed higher and the portion seemed smaller. I also think the s & s chicken is now battered so makes a big difference.  I would still go back and just order something different.
Located in Planet Hollywood. The food was good. Great location on the strip. The service was wonderful.
This restaurant a must tr anyone who wants large servings that can be shared with friends. wonderful
"We went for a meal as a couple, were seated straight away around 2030hrs on a Saturday night.

We chose to try here due to reviews on trip advisor and it was worth it.

Service was prompt, drinks are average but if you order a soft drink they are free refills.

I had BBQ ribs to start which were delicious and I didn't really need a main course. (6 in total)

I had sweet and sour chicken that came with a bowl of rice. Tasted good and didn't wait too long for the food.

Would recommend going if you looking for dinner on the strip"
"Bottom line:  Chicken lettuce wraps are our favorite.  This is a chain restaurant so you know what you’re getting!  Service is what set this place apart from other restaurants.  Bruce was an awesome waiter.  If you want to do dinner, there are so many great restaurants in Vegas.  Eat somewhere else and then go to PF Changs when you are back home!

We were having a big dinner later so stopped in for some lettuce wraps and sushi to hold us over until dinner.  If you’ve never had their chicken lettuce wraps, you must try them!  Two orders were just right for 5 of us, though we did have to ask for more lettuce.

Service was excellent here!  Bruce was our waiter and was really attentive to our needs, despite us ordering just lettuce wraps and sushi.  He had us sign up for the PF Changs reward program and was able to get one of the lettuce wraps free since we were celebrating someone’s 50th birthday in Vegas.  He had quite a few tables and was training someone as well and yet he still delivered superior service.  We enjoyed our quick bite to eat and our time with Bruce."
We ate lunch at PF Changs. We all had the Crispy Honey Shrimp with fried rice and we also ordered the Budda Feast (Veggies) it was excellent and the price was such a good value! I will eat here again! The restaurant was clean and very friendly staff...
"Yummy, as this restaurant is anywhere we visit one.  Very busy, which is a good sign but a seat at the bar was not difficult to locate."
"We chose this place as we all fancied an oriental meal... We love our Chinese food so they had a great deal to live up to and they did a pretty good job of it too. 

Our server Daisy was great at explaining what dishes were spicy and what ones were particularly popular. 

We kicked off with some Cauliflower Tempura that was good (not as good as the Cheesecake Factory version) and a fried Pork Dumpling that was juicy with a light steamed casing. 

Highlights were the main dishes of Changs Chicken, Mongolian Beef  and some Spicy Green Beans... all served with complimentary Steamed rice. Portion sizes we generous and we felt pretty stuffed once we had completed it all. 

My only issue was the Espresso coffee I ordered was not a good representative of this beverage, no foam and not very strong... goof craft beer though in well chilled glass went well with the chosen dishes."
"We're used to visiting PF Changs in Dubai so great to see one in Vegas, especially knowing they'd still be serving after seeing Pitbull in Planet Hollywood. Dynamite prawns were delicious (although normally served in a sundae dish) and the mains were spot on and it was very reasonably priced with attentive service. All in all definitely worthy of another visit when we're back in Vegas."
"We visited whilst in Vegas as we'd been looking for some traditional Chinese food and we weren't disappointed.
We were offered a seat at the bar area as it would have been about a 20 minute wait for a table, which turned out better as we had our personal waiter and service was very prompt.
Portions were more than enough, tasty and good value.
All round top place"
I have heard rave reviews about PF Changs and couldn't wait to try it.  I was disappointed in the quality of the food and it was pricey.  It really didn't have much taste.  Almost tasted like it came out of a box.  The chicken pieces were good quality but did not make up for the lack of taste.  Drinks were pricey but good and the service was good also.  I will not eat there again.
Located in planet Hollywood. Stepping inside you could forget you were in a casino. Staff were super friendly. Giving recommendations and super attentive. The food was great. The popcorn shrimp as a starter is a must. All meals were delicious and at a great price as well. Highly recommend it.
"Food was solid and the family really enjoyed it, particularly the beef.  For me the friendly and quick service pulls it from 4 to 5 stars. The kids loved it so much we went back again a couple of days later, when the food was even better."
Great food with a sizable menu to choose from. Portions are large so you can get a few dishes and share for sure. The decor is on Trend. My wife does not typically ear Chinese but loves the lettuce wraps
"Everything you'd expect from a PF changs but without the Vegas prices. Nice not to feel the Vegas rip off in one restaurant
All the usual favorites and great service. Good choice"
"We wanted a Chinese meal and were recommended pf Chang,initial thoughts were it had a great atmosphere and a lovely restaurant ,the staff were very efficient and we enjoyed our meal overall but it lacked a bit of taste and myself and my wife had different things which were both a little bland but we still enjoyed the experience"
I like the fact they don't jack up their prices to double the normal costs you would find in your hometown just because they are located on the strip
"This was my first time at a P.F.Changs and I can tell this was a great experience with Friends.  Good food, serving sizes, short waiting time.  Good service, as well"
"Since solo, sat at the bar.  Service was attentive.  Food was as the expected P F Changs.  
Centered in the strip, good location and reasonable priced"
Ate here twice while in Vegas and the food and service were fantastic both times. Modern and clean restuarant. PF Changs is the place to go for Asian food. You will not be disappointed.
"The service is good, staff polite, but the food is nowhere close to authentic Chinese, it is really like a fast food chain Chinese for which it is highly overpriced & overrated"
"At the bar, try a Cucumber Collins for a refreshing light drink to beat the heat outside! Want a tropical drink, it is not on the menu but ask for the P.F. Chang Pina Colada made with a their house made Toasted Coconut Pineapple Ice Cream. It is thick and creamy and full of the pina colada flavor. Have it plain, or get fancy with whip cream and a cherry!  This drink can also be an adult dessert!"
"First year we visited Vegas we didn't think much of the restaurant. But this time it was much better. Food was to a very high standard, good service and we even decided to eat here twice."
"Booked a reservation at P.F.Changs in summer Lin filled in drop down box to let restaurant know it's my husbands birthday. When we arrived at the restaurant for our reservation at no time did any member of staff acknowledge that it was my husbands birthday which was very disappointing. 
The food was average , temperatures of the food was not great , the food got cold very quickly, food was rushed to the table while we were eating different courses . The desert of banana spring roll wasn't the best , the banana inside the crispy roll had a taste of deterioration not nice . Not sure if I would want to return ..."
"Tip of the day - If you have tickets to a show at Planet Hollywood's Axis Theater then its a no brainer to go to PF Chang's for dinner.

I really enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken which comes with Spicy Sichuan chili sauce, peanuts, green onion, red chili peppers and your choice of brown or white rice for 15.95. I was treated very well and informed of a number of menu items and they helped me choose the right meal.  I am a frequent visitor of Planet Hollywood, but this was my first time at PF Chang's. I will now visit this nice restaurant every time I visit Las Vegas."
"P.F. Chang’s, Las Vegas.  They offered Chinese cuisine.  It was not bad, not great either.  It was forgettable.   Would I go here again…only if everything else is closed?"
"Great food with diverse menu and good ambiance , try their home made spicy chicken noodle soup it's unique"
Very tasty and big big portions. Friendly staff and well priced. Good wine and great location. Order small though :-)
I could have eaten here every day! A bit pricey though. But the food is always consistent and great!
"My girlfriend and I went to PF Changs on the first day of our Las Vegas Trip.
We had been advised by others and we were not disappointed.
The Restaurant seeems a tad expensive but not when comparing it to other Vegas Restaurants.
Our starters and main courses were delicious and we will definitely go back again."
"Conveniently located in Planet Hollywood, we went here for dinner.  We had allergies in our group, gluten intolerance and onions.  Onions were still in one of the dishes, it was sent back, another returned with the person saying NO ONIONS.  Guess what, after eating some of the dish onions were found.  She immediately ran to her room for benedryl and an epi pen.  The waitress was horrified, the manager was horrified, they both handles everything right. But that night two of us didn't feel well and woke in the am feeling like we had bad hangovers even though we had not had a drink.  Another two friends in two different groups, also didn't feel well after eating at PF Changs.  Not sure if it is MSG or something else but I would never eat here again. I truly spent the entire day drinking electrolytes and doing a cellular cleanse and didn't feel normal again until the evening."
"After reading mediocre reviews about several Las Vegas buffets, we decided to try P.F. Chang's in Planet Hollywood instead of a buffet. On a Sunday at 5 p.m. We were seated immediately in the booth we requested. Our server, Kyle, took our order immediately, and our meal was served promptly. The Chilean sea bass was OMG drop dead awesome! Without question the best fish either of us had ever tasted. We also ordered the Surf & Turf which was excellent, though it might have included a bit more beef. Berry cobbler for dessert was warm, crunchy, and served with high quality vanilla bean ice cream. Kyle was a great server: pleasant and appropriately attentive. Dinner for 2, including two glasses of wine cost $100. Well worth the price for that sea bass that we will never forget."
"We have loved Chang's for years now, always lovely decor, excellent food and friendly helpful wait staff... one of the more reasonable meals on the strip value of cost to quality"
lots of food out of stock. average taste. would I order from them again? no I will have to pass xxxxxxx
"Had dinner here again and had another lovely meal -great food,great service and lovely surroundings -will be back before our vacation ends on monday"
"In and out. Great service and great food.... so conveniently located, had great service, and received our food pretty quick for a busy saturday night."
"We were recommended this restaurant by a friend and boy we were not disappointed. We made a reservation because we weren't sure about how busy it would be. Our server was Lee, and he was awesome. Lee was very funny and added to the overall experience. 

The food was amazing with most of it prepared fresh in house, it came out hot, and had lots of choices for very good prices.

Would definitely go again, or if it comes to Calgary, Alberta, Canada."
"Every time we visit Vegas we come here at least one night for happy hour. Mai Tais are phenomenal. 
Lettuce wraps and spicy shrimp are always fresh and our go to.
They never disappoint."
We enjoyed our dinner here.  The service and food were very good and prices were much lower than other restaurants on the strip.  The restaurant is located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino.
"We were seated quickly, the waitress was attentive and paid attention to us.  The food was what we expected, it was hot and it was tasty.  They have a number of 4 and 5 star locations to eat there on the strip, but if you want a good meal, I would suggest skipping the 4 and 5 star locations and stop here..."
"We love PF Chang's so we weren't surprised that the food was really good.  And our waiter was exceptional....friendly, attentive, funny.  BUT, we must have waited for at least 45 minutes for our food.  The waiter came by and apologized more than once.  I'd recommend the restaurant, but only when you don't have a tight timeframe."
"I know PF Chang's is a chain but I've never had a bad meal in one of their restaurants.  The food was as good as always, and the waiters were good too.  This one is on the strip, so has good views if you get a window seat.  Enjoy!"
The PF Chang's inside PH is our favorite one.  The service is always excellent.  We love to sit at the bar during happy hour and sample many different dishes.
"Had a beautiful meal here, great service by our waiter and the food was great. Great location as well"
"As a table of 10, we expected to wait for a table - but when they tried to double out waiting time one of our party had a firm word, and thankfully we were then offered a private dining room which was fantastic for being able to chat amongst a large group.  Asked the waiter to guide our choices with info on what we liked and he came up with a fantastic selection - including a beautiful fish dish.

Cocktails were delicious, and I particularly like my honey and thyme G&T.  Finished off with a couple of mile high chocolate cakes to share - rich and decadent!

Apart from the blip waiting for the table, service was excellent."
"A standard PF Chang which is not a criticism- excellent service, perhaps the best we experienced in Las Vegas restaurants, their normal menu nicely cooked with the usual drinks selection all at reasonable prices."
"If you review this place for what it is, it's excellent!

It's a chain offering fast Chinese food!

We ate here before seeing a show and couldn't fault the food or service! I always have the Mongolian beef which is superb!

I would advise reserving a table though as it gets very busy!!"
Beautiful authentic cuisine with lots of much needed vegetables in the dishes we chose. Recommend fried dumplings for entree. Excellent beer & wine selection. Good system for waiting for a table without reservation. Waitstaff very friendly and accommodating which is nice for Vegas. Would definitely go back
"I came here with my family recently, the guy who served us was ridiculously over the top and fake.
He rushed us through our food (all the while wind was blowing other people's bills ect onto our table) removed our plates as quickly as he could to replace with dessert menus.
We left a tip which we do at every restaurant but his service was poor and frankly annoying so not as high as others. He thanked us before looking at the tip then came back to us waving it in our faces saying ""erm is this for me"" insinuating it wasn't enough, we just said yes then he walked off and completely ignored us. 
The food is great, but this guy needs a serious talking to because he ruined it completely for us!!"
As always going to Vegas is such an enjoyment the food the friends the fun makes it always so worthwhile I figure one thing that you should definitely do enjoy life to the fullest and make sure you eat great food this was the best way to end my trip before I got on my flight coming back east
"We always enjoy a meal here.  This trip, we were looking forward to trying new places, but still managed to drop in one afternoon for drinks and appetizers. The lobster avocado rolls are delicious. We also tried some pork dumplings, but that turned out to be the first thing we didn't enjoy here. Next time will try the lettuce wraps. The green beans are phenomenal!"
"Located right off the casino floor at PH, this place is a great choice if you have a craving for Chinese food.

We have been here several times over the years and it never disappoints.  Typical menu, prepared really well.

We use it as a great spot to take out.  They have a little window as you walk in, that takes to go orders.  Place your order and 10 to 15 minutes later, you are off.

Here are a few prices of the standards:
Crab wonton...4/$8.50, 6 $9.95.
Egg rolls 2/$7.95, 4/$11.95
Wonton soup $5.50/$9.50
Fried rice...$12.50
Chicken pad tai. $15.95
Sesame chicken $16.50

Just a sampling.  For the quality and quantity, very reasonable.
Enjoy"
Always have separate Vegetarian dishes which are quite nice and reasonable in price.Sat outside which was nicer than inside which was a little stuffy.Normal service .
Both my wife enjoyed our two visits.  Great staff great food . Good selection and priced well.  My wife made me go back so she have takeout to bring home
Love the food and service in Changs. The crispy green beans and lettuce wraps are fantastic. My daughter loves eating here and the food is always to a high standard
"Although usually crowed, that actually speaks of the service and food provided!  A very good meal and you MUST en it with the Great Wall of Chocolate cake --- a terrific desert, although the first time my wife and I had it, the cake was apparently still somewhat frozen, so we were not impressed with anything but the size.  However, we took the extra with us, and the next morning, even having been in a frig over night it was amazing!  Their soups, spring rolls and main courses are also good!"
"My husband and I were told that we should try PFChang's and we were not disappointed. The service was fast and there were lots of choices. The food was delicious and portion sizes were great. Prices were reasonable. We both loved the lettuce wraps!!!! If you have the chance, you should try it."
If staying at or around Bellagio just walk across the street and get a great meal for far less than anything at the hotel. Great casual lunch!
"We revisited this restaurant after 12 years, and the experience of the lettuce wraps was something we wanted to re-savour. My wife is vegetarian and we ordered vegetarian lettuce wraps. The vegetarian mix was evenly diced, well flavoured, with a hint of smoky flame to boot. Highly recommended."
"I have been a couple of times in P. E Chang in Planet Hollywood Las Vegas and the food is very tasty, and the attention is excellent."
"This place is just like the other chain sisters however we noticed than in Las Vegas prices are higher than in our hometown in Texas maybe the city I don't know but same kind of food, great lettuce wraps and chocolate wall of China desert."
"Good quality food, ordered hot and sour soup and lettuce wraps. Asked for the soup first, got it after the wraps. Soup pricing is strange, small bowl for 5.50 or a huge bowl which has about 5 servings for less than double the price, that's great for two or more, but to much for one. 

Service is normally better at PF Chang, saw orders being brought to wrong tables."
My wife has a shellfish allergy so I informed the waitress about this and she was extremely helpful and brought over another menu which showed which dishes were available. The food itself was very good and reasonably priced. I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation.
You can walk here off the strip or off the casino.. The food is always good you can use your points and their food is always good
"PF Chang's is located on the street side of Planet Hollywood so it's easy to find.  We were in a hurry as we had tickets to a show, so we told our waiter and were given excellent service.  We chose the shrimp w/lobster sauce and the ginger chicken.  The shrimp was delicious.  We both loved it but the chicken was more broccoli than chicken and the broccoli was barely cooked, so the large pieces were both hard to cut & hard to chew.  We would have liked fried rice but only steamed brown or white rice is offered.  But for good service, flavor and price, it's a winner."
"We discovered PF Chang’s when we were in Long Beach, CA and ate here 3 times since. We always go for the menu. 
When we were seated we were greeted by our waiter (Lee W) who sounded very friendly at first. He explained who he was, but didn’t explain anything about the menu. When we hesitated what to take (the menu changed) he started to get less friendly. 
We discovered the wok dishes on the back of the menu and when we wanted to order it it seemed to be part of the fixed menu, something the waiter didn’t explain. He started to get annoyed when we asked for a bit more time to review what we would order. When we decided what to take, we tried to call him several times, but were ignored 3 times. 
At the same time a big party arrived so the waiter did his usual pre-studied routine with the table (very friendly of course since they had not hesitated yet). Also the waiter’s body language when he was at our table was not one you would expect in an expensive restaurant.
The food was nice a usual, but the waiter really spoiled to experience, sorry."
"Every time we come to Vegas we make it a point to visit P.F. Chang's. We usually do the two for $54 option, which unfortunately is not on the menu. If you ask though, the employees will explain which dishes can be chosen for this option. You each get a soup, an appetizer to share, an entree, and dessert. Would highly recommend the crab wontons, as well as the Mongolian beef. As well the wonton soup is extremely delicious. If you are not with a big group and are looking to sample a few plates I would highly recommend this option. Overall, will continue to visit P.F. Chang's."
"A different twist on Chinese, but fairly good, a large chain, they had some great dishes, the lettuce wraps and some of there soups are a must have"
"This P.F. Chang's is in a great location on Las Vegas Blvd. Loved basking in the heat of the day on their patio while we stopped in for lunch. There were many choices of gluten free fare, all of what we ordered being extremely tasty. Portions were generous and I should know by now that when you eat at any P.F. Chang's you don't just drop by for a 'bite'! Service was excellent with great attention. There was a small issue with a child pan-handler popping onto the patio and annoying patrons, but the manager was quick to put a stop to it and offer apologies all the way around. Just a great stop!"
My daughter and I are both celiac and chose this restaurant due to them claiming to have good GF options. ANd they did! We were given a separate menu and the waiter seemed very knowledgeable and our options. The food came on different plates as well to help differentiate our food.
Excellent selection of appetizers and entrees. Very tasty and excellent plate presentation. Service was friendly and efficient. Prices mid range and reasonable.
"Just a lite lunch, Kao Pung Chicken tacos and dynamite shrimp, tacos were a little smaller than I'd like but it was on the small plate section so my bad. Shrimp were battered sort of tempura style with a mild hot sauce and very good."
PF Changs is always great! The franchise is consistent everywhere. The service is second to none! I love it he idea of sharing orders because you get to experience more dishes then you would a la carte. There was 8 of us and I think we ordered 6 entres and there was more than enough food for all of us. The price was reasonable for the location. I would eat here again.
"Food was Ok, starters were much better than the mains which were just average, waiter were friendly and service was decent, but not likely to return as too many better options in Vegas"
Delicious food. Good service. What more could you ask for .....banana spring rolls served with pineapple and coconut ice cream!!!!! Awesome!
"The food was very good, the location very convenient but I felt the staff were running around and not really offering the service expected.  I order a few dishes and asked if that sounded reasonable (between the two of us) and she agreed, but when it came out it was enough to feed a family of 5.  A little bit of guidance would have helped as it felt wasted."
Never disappointed and have visited many times. Take out is also good if you want to relax in your hotel room. Service is great and food is always delicious. Especially the crispy green beans and lettuce wraps.
"The service at the bar was good. Drinks are strong and appetizers come out fast, nice, and freshly cooked."
1st time dining at this restaurant and it did not disappoint. Ordered the calamari as appetizer along with the lettuce wraps as well as two dishes. Calamari was nothing special but all the other dishes were delicious.  Next time ill either skip the appetizers or dishes as it was way too much food due to their large sized portions. Was staying at the Planet Hollywood so eating here was an easy walk across the casino from our room. They do have some happy hours deals which you should not overlook.
Six of us went for dinner and the food and service were very good. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a dinner group or on your own.
we ate here on our first night in LV. Very plain food for a Chinese/Asian restaurant. we where really disappointed with the quality of food and the menu in general. Good service but poor food.
Every trip to Vegas means I get a lemondrop Martini and crab wontons.  We also try one new menu item every visit and have never been disappointed. Very generous portions.
Was not impressed at all with the food regardless of the prices.  We will most definitely not be returning.  I do not recommend this place.
"Great Service and great food. 
We always start with Chicken Lettuce Wrap.
Love Orange Peel Shrimp and Mongolian Beef.
Don't forget to order the great wall of chocolate cake
They changed the menu, used to have great tiramisu.
We love to have dinner here..."
"Stopped in here with the missus for some ""dimmers"" after a night on the lash..in the humour of something light as American food quality can really mess with are European stomachs(to many banned substances)
Any way got plates and plates of wontons ribs, dumplings etc. And was surprised food was tasty as hell, better than the standard of food we get over here ,
every thing was full of flavour and cooked really really well and quick service, will eat here every time I'm in Vegas in the future as did fell stogy or anything after it"
"I love this restaurant and have always had a good meal here.  Be sure to make a reservation, because wait times can be lengthy depending on the day of the week."
"We recently dined at P.F. Chang's, located on Las Vegas Blvd., in the Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino.  This restaurant is very expansive, but clean, and has two floors of dining along with an outdoor patio.
We do not have a P.F. Chang in our area and always look forward to our trips to Vegas so that we can return to one of our favorite restaurants. We had a family dinner for four and had one of the best dining experiences ever.  Our Server, Oscar, was by far one of the most accommodating, friendly, knowledgeable servers we have ever had. Oscar was a pleasure to be served by and made our experience special."
Very good food. Not too crowded but for some reason the service was slow so that's why I can't give this restaurant full points. We love the shrimp with walnuts and Mellon. The Singapore curry noodles were okay. We've had better. The coconut milk drink was very refreshing. We waited a long time for the server to bring our food and finally cleanup and present the bill.
"We don't have this chain restaurant in our state, so we always stop when in Vegas. The Mongolian beef is my husbands favorite. The server brought out a piping hot bowl of the sauce to put over the rice which was a nice touch. Ask for it if your server doesn't offer! I had the pad Thai which had plenty of shrimp and tofu. The sauce was not too spicy and the serving size was large enough for two meals (for me). The pan fried pork dumplings were excellent and I highly recommend. It was packed with meat and topped with a light garlic soy sauce. Justin was our waiter and he went the extra distance to make our meal memorable. Its amazing how a mediocre meal can be perceived to be wonderful if the service is exceptional. Justin is good at what he does and while our meal was excellent, his service was too!"
Another chain so no variance in menu.  We were in Planet Hollywood casino and mall area. Dropped by for a quick bite. Generous servings.  Food was OK but not remarkable.  Spoiled by being across the street at the Mandarin.
Tried having dinner here as we were only staying at Planet Hollywood.  The waiter was very helpful when we were ordering our food and gave suggestions. The cocktails were good as well. I normally do not like restaurant chains but PF chang's is an exception.
"Standard PF Chang's experience. Headed down for happy hour drinks and appetizers at the bar and then entree's in the restaurant. Good quality food, freshly cooked and plenty of it. Good location at Planet Hollywood. A safe bet - wouldn't hesitate to return."
We had no booking and walked in off the strip.   Excellent service and beautiful food   I got pad Thai and usually don't eat chinese/Asian but it was beautiful
"We usually have a Chinese one night on our visits to Vegas but haven't always been impressed with the quality of the food or the service. There were no such issues at PF Changs where the food was excellent and the service was very good too. We started with our favourite, Dim Sum, followed by Crispy Honey Chicken and Shrimp. The service was swift and friendly even though the restaurant was pretty full. Next time we want a Chinese meal in Vegas we'll be going back to PF Changs."
"Great view sitting upstairs by the windows looking onto LV Blvd/The Cosmo/Bellagio.  Service was pretty good.  Food was exactly as expected and cocktails were tasty.  In Vegas, this is a safe choice and a decent value."
"We ate here on one of our nights in Vegas. The place was extremely busy however we had a drink at the bar and the table was ready in 10 minutes. Whilst at the bar my husband was undecided on what veer to order, the waiter was really nice and let him sample. The food was amazing especially the ribs, fried rice and the prawns which my husband ordered. We had a few drinks each and the bill was less than $100. It's rare to get good food reasonably priced on the boulevard."
"The service is some of the best on the strip.  They have a great glassed in patio that is amazing for people watching.  Food is good, hot, served fast and reasonably priced.  

Get the tequila punch for two, great on a hot day!"
Food is same as all other PF Chang's.  But it tends to get crowded early and stay that way.  Can get quite loud.  Vouchers and points not accepted
Lovely quality food at reasonable price and good service. Had to wait 10 mins for a walk in table but was worth it. Never eaten in this chain before but would thoroughly recommend
Had an excellent dinner here on April 6 with friends and family. Customer service from our waiter Tony was excellent and the food was delicious. Try the Moscow Mules!
Disappointed by the Vietnamese noodle salad with Shrimp.  Tasteless.  Returned to the kitchen and ordered the hot wings.  They were very tasty and spicy.  The lettuce wraps were average.
"I had high expectations for this restaurant. We say outside so we could take in the steip in our first night.  The service was pretty good and we ordered the potstickers, sweet and sour chicken, and a side of the greens for our very late dinner. Also a mule cocktail because what the hell. I just turned 21 and wasn't carded by our server which was odd but when the food arrived I was a bit underwhelmed even when I was very hungry after a long day of travel. The food was very average and the price wasn't that impressive either. P.F. Chang's in Chicago beats this place hands down."
"If you go during dinner, you could experience a long wait.  Service was good, food was very good, but PF Chang's usually is.  Love the location as it is part of a casino but you can access the restaurant from the street.  Don't know if they do reservations, if you are going to dine during prime dining hours, I would call ahead to get a reservation.  Would eat here again for a good Chinese American fusion meal."
"Absolutely fantastic. Best Chinese I've ever been to.
The food quality was fantastic the waiter was really great as normally in the UK when we order Chinese we order 4/5 dishes, however he advised us that the portions were really large and we had ordered way too much, he was not at all interested in pushing the sales but literally concerned we would be wasting our money ordering too much food which was really nice as normally you get pushy waiters just wanting to get you to spend as much as possible.
The food whenever I was phenomenal could not fault it at all and didn't want to leave any as it just tasted so good. The atmosphere was really great, bustly and fun vibe and we had a really nice see upstairs overlooking the strip and could even see the Bellagio fountains from where we were sat.
Really reasonable price to, the bill was around $50 including drinks for the two of us.
This was the best place we ate in Vegas and would 100% return"
"Not true Asian food like you'd have in Asia but an excellent variety of Asian fusion.  The service was fabulous and quick as well.  This was our first time at a PF Changs and if visiting in the states, we'd try it again."
"Feeling in the need of some Chinese food, we opted for PF Changs, and it was okay.  Tasty enough, but not worth a repeat visit, with so many other restaurants to choose from."
This place was packed out when we arrived. The food we felt wasn't as good as other US locations however I've noticed that the norm in Las Vegas. Great view towards the bellagio and handy at the entrance of magnificent mile shopping centre.
"We LOVE PF Changs - it's always delicious! Such a good restaurant for groups, its fun to order a bunch of different plates and share them all. 

Some of our favourites - the lettuce wraps, the green beans, and the Mongolian beef. 

It's a bit overpriced, but we never come to Vegas without going for a meal. We always enjoy it."
Great Chinese food. The two children enjoyed very much the prawn and the chicken dishes. Sea Bass dish was very good too. Ruchi and I had a lovely evening too.
"We sat outside and enjoyed watching the people on the strip while eating. The food was very good, as was the service. It was a bit hot for the first part of the meal as the sun was directly on us, but as soon as we got into the shade, it was very enjoyable. Prices are $15-$25."
"The Waitress was attentive and knowledgeable. We enjoyed the Drinks that was somewhat unusual.  We had two Appetizers; Lettuce Wraps, Won Tons.  They turned out to be large enough for dinner.  We also had the Coconut Curry and Street Noodles which also were delicious and very large portions.  A Very good mid-priced restaurant."
"Great food, really good service and a good beer selection. Service,is always quick and efficient.  Get a booth if you can."
"We were a party of two, the service was very fast but unfortunately the lettuce of the wraps was not fresh! the lettuce is the magic of the dish.
Anyways, rice and Mongolian steak and the mix of steak with lobster was very good  !! enjoy"
"Stopped in for lunch.Very friendly, food was great , quick service Happy people. Would definitely go again."
Everytime we come to Las Vegas we hit up PF Changs. The food is fresh and tasty. Prices are very good considering its Las Vegas and in a casino. The staff are always quick and courteous. We have tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.
"I love PF Chang and I'm not too proud to say it. Whether eating Hot & Sour soup at the poker table or dining in on the impressive menu, this place rocks!"
When we arrive in Vegas we always go here first.  It's in the center of the strip and the food is always excellent.  Can't wait to go back
PF Chang's is my favorite restaurant and part of the reason is the food is amazing no matter which one I go to. I also like the decor and how it has a theme but each restaurant is slightly different. This location was wonderful for lunch. It wasn't too crowded when we went and it was great!!
"Very friendly staff, this place has a quick exit to the strip, the soda that comes out the gun is very flat  lunch time specials are very cheap great time if your looking to save money"
THis is one of my favorite places togo for food. Needless to say when eating there I have to be rolled out. I will usually order enough for 4 people but as I say it is still a single persons serving size if you try hard enough. Definitely try the beans.
Nice enough food. Bit expensive. We had an extremely irritating waiter named Bruce. That'll be my memory of the experience - irritating waiter.
"We here with a group of friends for dinner. I find Asian food can all taste very similar but the dishes were excellent. The chicken lettuce wraps are awesome ! Service was excellent. Super busy place, be prepared to wait for a table but it will be worth it !"
"I am in Las Vegas 3-5 times a year for the past 42 years and when you find a great place most of us usually stick to it as was the case with PF Chang's so going there 1-2 times per stay does say something about the food and the service there I would think but Surprise, Surprise this time around ?? The Hostess was great, and that is where it had stopped. Waited for 15 minutes to have a table cleaned and mind you this was early afternoon on Sunday so the place wasn't really busy, so not only did we wait but never got the table that we were waiting for and then came our Waitress ?? Polite ? doesn't know the definition of that word but now the word RUDE she had MASTERED, so knowing what was to become of this not to mention that I thought like in the past I was saving one of the best restaurants for last , MY BAD. Our drinks came in a reasonable time frame but then when ordering dinner and appetizer's one would think that your appetizer's  would come out first, WRONG ANSWER so our Lettuce Wraps came out along with our Won Ton Soup along with the main coarse so all of the orders were ready at the same time except for the Spring Rolls which came out after we had already finished eating not to mention that they were dark brown(Clearly overcooked) and when we sent them back our Server had said ""WELL I HAD TOLD YOU THAT I WAS GOING TO PUT YOUR ORDER IN AND HOW THEY COME OUT THEY COME OUT"". AS for the Lettuce Wraps, nothing like in the past, not sure what they had changed but in the past they were one of the best items on the menu and the BOWL of Won Ton Soup ?? there were 7 yes 7 Won Ton's in the whole BOWL."
this restaurant is in the Planet Hollywood Casino..   the food and service are always great.  A glass of plum wine with your meal is really tasty
"We have eaten here twice during our trip to Las Vegas and the food was some of the best I have eaten! The ribs were too die for, both types we tried and would recommend them both. We had Mongolian beef and sesame chicken for a main, and it was truly delicious. This restaurant opens until 1 in morning on a weekend and the service doesn't falter even if you turn up at 12.45am in the morning. The service is second to none and the portions again were huge and delicious!! What u couldn't eat they packaged up and you could take away and that again was eaten the next morning as we couldn't waste it! Highly recommend this place and will be returning on my next visit"
"Was looking for chiness for lunch and read the reviews for PF Changs and headed there
Food and service was good just as reviews said
Would recommend and will go again"
"My family and I decided to have dinner here since we were already staying at Planet Hollywood. The food and service were excellent. We even commented that the menu and food seemed a lot better than at other PF Chang's we've been to here in LA. We ordered Shrimp with lobster sauce, fried rice, Shrimp lo mein, and Hong Kong style Chilean sea bass."
We have eaten at this PF many times and this was way sub par and way to salty. In addition we sat outside and the glass panel that separates the seating from them sidewalk was disgustingly dirty....maybe never ever cleaned. I don't want to sit next to disgusting filth while I eat my meal. Will never return.
I've eaten at this PF Chang's several times. It's always a pleasure coming back. This time we were really hungry so it was a pleasure to be seated quickly. Our server was extremely hard working and pleasant. She was very happy to accommodate our requests for reduced sodium in our meals. Always a pleasure eating here with a view of the Las Vegas strip.
"For Vegas, this was a downright bargain! We sat on the patio, so we got to enjoy street performers and the Bellagio fountains as we dined. I had a Moscow mule, which they make with their house made ginger beer. Excellent! Best I've had! I had a lobster roll and the lobster shrimp jicama tacos (the soak jicama so it becomes the shell instead of a flour or corn tortilla... very fresh tasting!). I had banana spring rolls with coconut ice cream for dessert. So yummy! I did not feel robbed of my money at the end, the food was great, and the atmosphere was perfect! I'm going to look for one in my area to try!"
"Our friends wanted to eat at P.F. Chang's and we are so glad we did!  We dined outdoors and it was so nice to enjoy the weather.  Our server was awesome.  We had ordered and he suggested some changes to save us some money.  We really appreciated the service and tipped generously....for the first time, a server came back and thanked us for the tip saying he was getting married the next weekend and this will sure help.   The food was so good and plentiful!  We had the mongolian beef, fried rice, lettuce wraps and egg rolls for the 4 of us.  More than enough to share!   I am now wishing there was a P.F.Chang's in my hometown!"
"If you are familiar with PF Changs, you know that the food is always very good.  This is a very popular restaurant and most evenings, there is a wait to be seated.  The bar is extremely popular. It's located in Planet Hollywood, which is a plus as far as ease in finding it."
"When you live in an area or ""Country""
with out your favorites franchises, the first thing you do when you hit the USA is dine to delight your taste buds.
Lettuce wraps & California Rolls...
Soooo Yummy!"
This is your typical PF Changs.  Beautiful interior.  Interesting cocktail menu.  The pork dumplings were very very good.  The Sesame chicken portion was on the smaller size but the LoMein portion was huge.  They encourage you to sign up for their preferred program but I never received anything via email.
"I always travel, and always visit PF CHANGS in Las Vegas or Mexico City, dishes are the same even the menu it's the same, everything start it with the waitress, I was at the table reading the menu with the candle and this guy came and he move the candle that I was using to read because of the light of the restaurant, I tell him please put the candle to where it was and he upset and push the candle in a bad way, I don't know what's wrong with this people, there are there to serve us, that's why the try to get a good tip, any way I order a Waldorf salad and I know very well how does it taste, so this salad doesn't have carrot and cabbage, so I call the manager and she came with an horrible face to me, obviously the waitress have tell her that I have an issue with him, she give a bad look, but I explain to her the problem, she was very negative until I tell her read the menu and tell me if the salad it's made with carrot and cabbage, but no apple, no grapes, no kale, a horrible dish they bring me, then she realize I was right, so the change the salad but I was afraid all the time this waitress spit on my food or do something even worst, I recommend be sure of what you order, because they believe no one knows their dishes, a lack of quality, and waitress with out any desire of be a servant, not a good place to eat."
One of the spots we always visit. Food is great value. We like to order a few dishes and split everything. Friendly staff whether we sat for dinner or popped in for take out.
"We sat outside on a nice evening.  Service was friendly, but a little slow.  The server seemed to disappear for long periods of time.

Food was good and serving sizes good for the price, which is typical for PF Changs.

Beer selection was good with some interesting craft brews.  

Overall a good dining experience for the strip."
"Had never been to this location of PF Chang's inside Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Came here for a business meeting. It was a Saturday night, so it was a very busy night, specially on the Strip. I was surprised service was quick and the server was amazing. As expected from PF, food was great and I enjoyed it. Our table had Strip view across the street from the Cosmopolitan, which was amazing."
"We are from western Canada so don't have PF Changs.  That said, my husband  and I have been to many locations in lots of different places but always on trip without our kids.  This trip our kids were with us and we were excited to finally take them.  They loved it!  We know the location in planet holiday gets busy and we are a family of 5 with tickets for a late show so we went online and booked a reservation.  It was so easy and we are glad we did.  Some of our favourites are the lettuce wraps, chilli greens beans, and a new favourite was the Brussels sprouts.  Delicious!"
Great place to stop in for lunch. Food and service were great. A bit pricey but good. Has plenty of room and even some Gluten Free items.
PF Changs in the Planet Hollywood Casino was a pleasant surprise. The food was great and so was the service.
"I make it a point to go to the PF Changs in Planet Hollywood every time I'm in Vegas. 

It is a great place to have a casual dinner with a group of friends. 

The highlights for me are: Chicken Noodle Soup, Mongolian Beef, Lettuce Wraps and the Buddhist Feast. 

The food is consistently food and I've been there 5 times in the past year.  They also do take out for those of you who need a late night snack."
"Delivers just what you expect from a franchise. Food, service, and atmosphere were spot on and they made a pretty good Bloody Mary."
"PF Changs never disappoints. Always great food and good portions. The wait is the only thing, but honestly, I'd rather wait for great food than settle for mediocre, if you're not starving. Our waiter Heather was very attentive. The atmosphere was phenomenal, especially on the second floor."
"It was so busy when we came for dinner one night but we were lucky enough to get 2 spots at the bar. The service was amazing, drinks were always refilled and we had a nice time. The conversation was good, it was a nice atmosphere, and we got great food. The lettuce wraps itself are amazing and a lot of food. We both created our own stir fry and they were made perfectly. The location of PF Chang's is perfect, right on the strip or accessed through Planet Hollywood. I wish I could remember the name of the guy behind the bar because I'd give him a shout out for being so great. He was a tall black man, great job! It's also really cool at PF Chang's how the bartenders work together. Great experience!!! Awesome dinner option!"
"I'd love to thank Oscar, our waiter. He was exceptional, his service was above and beyond. He made sure we enjoyed our meal and took his time to explain the menu. Oscar, I thank you for being one of the many highlights on our trip to Vegas!"
"This place is a good option in every place that you can find it. Always a garanty. It was one problem ""the waitng list"" arround 1 hour."
"Booked via cell for 7pm and arrived on time told to wait by the side for another 10 min, taken to our table on the upper deck , ordered drinks which took a bit longer than expected, had to ask for water, ordered 2 entrees, 1st one arrived cold so sent back, pork dumplings , waiter explained that 2nd entree of chicken satay would be a bit longer, pork dumplings replaced disappointing as only Luke warm, so hungry so we ate but did advise waiter. 2nd entree arrived about 10 mins later only satay sauce didn't taste anything like peanut, but we ate anyway. Main meal arrived after about 15 mins & surprise the sea bass tasted great. Overall the food was very average for a well known restaurant"
"I am a fan of pf Chang and found that this location is as good as my local restaurant.  The prices are a little higher because of the ""Vegas"" factor, but the food was as good as expected.  The waiter was entertaining and even though they were quite busy we were still served pretty quickly."
"PF Changs is good food at a reasonable price.
It's a chain- so the same selections are at every location and taste the same. This location can get pretty busy- not a bad idea to make a reservation if you want to avoid waiting."
"The service was excellent and we received a lot of help from 'Oscar' our waiter. The food was delicious and is meant to be shared between several people. Only fault is that the toilet was out of the restaurant, everything else was perfect."
This restaurant is very convenient to where we stay. I popped in for a late lunch and decided to give two new items a try. The Brussels sprouts and Kung Pao chicken jicama tacos were both delicious. Nice to have lower carb tacos. Would definitely have both again.
"PF Chang's is always a great option when you want a great meal.  I have never had a bad meal there.  Prices are reasonable, service is good."
We spent some time here at PF Changs and enjoyed the meal. Lots of rice and noodles and less lobster than I would like. Good taste though and good service. We'll go again.
"Went for lunch on the Vegas Strip.
Great patio seating for people watching.
The little birds grazing our heads were a bit distracting...
Service was fast and friendly. Restaurant was clean. 
Had lettuce wraps!! Recommend !!
They were delicious! 
$$"
"We made reservations for a part of nine. We were shown to a private room with one big table. The waitress suggested we go family style, ordering a few appetizers and several entrees to share. 

It was great! 

The service was fast and friendly. The food was great. And at the end the bill was very reasonable, (I think it was $240 with tax!)

We left a big tip and look forward to eating here again."
It was my first time at PF Chang's. The for was great and plenty of it as all three couples left the table more than satisfied!! It didn't seem to pricey for what we had I believe it was around $100 per couple with a tip and than included dessert!!!
"I visited the restaurant for lunch when I stayed at PH.  It is on the casino floor and therefore is one of those decent restaurants conveniently located.  However, the food was not really special.  The soup was not very warm, and it tasted shallow.  The lunch plate (chicken and fried rice) was poorly arranged and did not have much of taste.  The waitress served me well, and it was a nice environment."
P.F. Chang's always seems to be good. Delicious dinner and friendly service. We had a table by a second floor window which was nice for watching people walk the Strip. I especially like their Banana Spring Rolls dessert (not gluten-free).  They do also have good gluten-free dinners and dessert.
I have to preface that I am not a fan of the chain to begin with.  So my review is not unbiased.  Food is always flavorless and bland. Its a Chinese themed food restaurant not Chinese food at all.  Came here because work group chose location.  No by choice.  Drinks are good and stick to the appetizers.
"When in Vegas, it always boggles my mind that people go to a chain restaurant, but the food is predictably tasty.  This is located inside Planet Hollywood, which is itself a very confusing hotel connected to the Miracle Mile mall.  If you drive here, it is incredibly inconvenient, as you have to drive under the hotel, walk about a half mile through the mall and the hotel.  Give yourself 25-30 minutes.  You are definitely better off walking off the Strip and going in.  The ambiance is dark, cherry wood feel, but it is crowded, cramped, and exceedingly loud.  You can't hold an intimate conversation."
One great place to go for fresh hot Chinese food. It's in planet Hollywood to. Share a dish as the portions are large. We ordered pork fried rice which old have been enough for 4 people. The shrimp in lobster sauce is great. We seem to eat the same thing there but it's good. Good service too.
Our server Jamie went a step above... Her recommendations and friendliness made us feel at home! The food was excellent and atmosphere comfortable. We tried a few different things tonight. Yum! We will be back.
Some of the food and drinks in Las Vegas! We had the best service we have ever had. We will be back for sure!
"Got to Vegas late after a day of flying struggles.  Grateful that at 11:50 pm we could still get food.  Service was great, waiter was attentive and nice.  We ordered Chicken Fried Rice & lettuce wraps.  The wraps are always the best.  Disappointed with the Rice, it was very dry but taste was still good."
"We are regular patrons of PF Chang.  The food was as good as it typically is.  We had a new dish Shanghai firecracker chicken, which was moderately flavorful and the always good Kung Pao shrimp.  Starter was the lettuce wrap with chicken.  We shared a molten lava cake w/our coffees.  
Server was outstanding, anticipating needs and making excellent suggestions."
"We have eaten at PF Chang's at least 6 times over the last few years. As per my last review the food has always been good honest Chinese, good serving size and good service - nothing special but good.
This trip there were 6 of us, the food was again good but the service was the worst we have ever experienced. Our waitress (Sheila) just did not want to be there and she let us know through bad service. She told us several times we were her last customer, (it wasn't even 10 pm), she just brought us the invoice without asking and certainly before checking if we wanted anything else which we did. She then used a pen and a marker to highlight the tip we should leave. The nicer we tried to be and engage her the ruder she got. On the way out I told the reception staff about the bad service - they didn't seem to care. So we probably won't care if we go back again."
"I have to say, PF Changs is always great food and great atmosphere, however, our waiter Ozzy made this the best dining experience we have ever had...ever! He is the best waiter ever in the world!"
"Ordered the spring rolls, firecracker chicken and he chicken pad Thai and I think I may have died and gone to heaven!! Everything tastes amazing and the service was great! I would go back in a heartbeat! Atmosphere was comfortable and we had a great view of the strip! Probably was one of the cheapest dinners we spent on but the quality and taste was on par with the restaurants were we spent a lot of money on!"
"As stated, you are getting what you expect. Bonus to watch people walking by. The service and food seemed slightly better than other PF Changs.  But you know what you're getting. No surprises. Nothing extraordinary."
Its located in Planet Hollywood Casino and I would say its a good place if you are on a budget try it.
"There is another location not far from this one just off the strip. Located in the planet Hollywood hotel.  Great high ceilings.  Some upstairs dining.  Casual dining at inexpensive prices.  Shared beef and broccoli and Kung pal chicken for dinner. A little too spicy for us.  Great, friendly staff.  Never disappointed at a PF Chang's.  A little difficult to find.  We were following the signs through the hotel and casino and got lost and had to ask someone along the way.  You go down escalators with large crystal light structures on the side of the escalators down to the restaurant which is another walk from them."
"Since I have ordered these before from a few other locations, the lettuce wraps were just as good here.  We honestly just wanted to eat somewhere familiar and knew we could get something we enjoyed.

The staff was very good, our waiter took excellent care of us.  It was fairly crowded but we were able to get seated fairly quickly."
Tasty food and a beautiful environment. Really enjoyed the chilli asparagus from the starters. We went here on our last night in vegas and really enjoyed our meal
I still do not know why people rave about  this restaurant there is always a line up and the food is really average oriental food at an exorbitant price
"P.F. Chang has two location in Las Vegas. The P.F. Chang in Las Vegas Blvd should make an effort in improving food presentation and preparation. Very different from the other location in Las Vegas which we frequent but since our hotel was in Paris Hotel, this location was convenient."
"Called off in here one evening as it had come recommended by some friends who had recently stayed in Vegas, so glad we did.

It was a very warm evening and we wished to sit at a table outside. The waiter said that would be possible but there would be a bit of a wait, which was fine. Drinks were had while we waited for a table, the Ginger Beer was fantastic!

When sat outside (only a half hour wait) the same waiter came and took our order. My husband had the Orange Chicken which he said was gorgeous and very tasty. I'm afraid I went for my usual Sweet and Sour but again this was very tasty. The rice and noodles had were excellent and a huge portion of each. All the food was hot when brought to our table and beautifully presented. The wait for our food took a little but that we did not mind as it was cooked fresh and the quality good. A few glasses of vino were had also.

It was great sat outside and watching the world go by and the Elvis entertainer who set up outside the restaurant on The Strip. Our waiter was smartly dressed, chatty, friendly and courteous at all times. The portions were huge and we therefore took our time to eat it all, but it was nice not to be rushed to finish.

I can highly recommend having a meal in P F Changs and if ever we are in Vegas again I know it will be somewhere we will be returning too."
"I rarely give restaurants a ""poor"" rating (just look at my other reviews), but this place just absolutely disappointed me (actually, after writing this review I went back up and changed my rating to ""terrible"").  I LOVE P.F. Changs and have been numerous times before, so I have come to know what to expect when I go there.

First of all, we were there for lunch and the dining room was approximately 40% full.  So, the ""we-are-sorry-it's-taking-so-long-but-we-are-really-busy-right-now"" excuse from the waiter didn't really cut it.  After waiting for a VERY, VERY long time, I fully expected them to offer to bring us out an appetizer or a round of drinks on the house, but that did not happen.

Oh well, the food at P.F. Changs is always worth the wait, right?  Usually, I would say ""yes,"" but this time it was a colossal disappointment.  The food came out lukewarm.  I ordered the honey shrimp and it was (believe it or not) under-cooked.  Aside from being under-cooked and lukewarm, it had absolutely no flavor.  In all honesty, I think they forgot some of the ingredients in the sauce or something.  I was in shock.  I really was in shock.

I certainly won't go to this P.F. Changs again, and I may not go to any P.F. Changs again.  Hopefully this was a fluke, but I'm not sure I'm willing to sit down and eat another boring, lukewarm, under-cooked dish like this again.

Again, I usually am not critical of restaurants, but this was truly disappointing."
"We typically spend a LOT of money on food/drinks in fine dining restaurants in Vegas because we love food, but sometimes we forget about a consistently good alternative. We had done Christmas dinner at Prime, then tasting menus at another venue the next night and were just ready to not see $140-$150 per person dinner tabs. Then it clicked! PF Chang's has sea bass and shrimp and all sorts of wonderful dishes for WAYYYYY less. And a bottle of our favorite wine with dinner? $24, yes for the bottle not the glass. Our server was excellent, we got seated right away (make reservations, this place gets busy) and we were able to do appetizers, entrees, bottles and whatever we wanted for a fraction of the other places. We honestly enjoyed it as much as we had our other meals too!"
"Went to PF Changs last night.
We looked through trip advisor and decided to go after looking at their menu and prices.
My wife is gluten free and they had a separate menu which was good. When we got to the table and received their menu. The prices were about 20% higher than what is stated on trip advisor. The meals were also very small for the price paid.
Food i would consider as average Chinese food. Have had better for a lot less."
"Ordered some late night take out.  Was pleasantly surprised: the food was a good quantity (we ordered 3 dishes that was ample enough for 4 people).  The price of the food was also reasonable, and came out fast.  Would definitely go back!"
"We had the beef and greens, sweet and sour chicken and tempura cauliflower. Outstanding and bill was very reasonable."
BEST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. GREAT food. i would recommend the chilean bass fish and the dynamite shrimp. the shrimp tacos were excellent too. and the banana roll dessert as well. TOTALLY WORTH IT
"There was a fair amount of wait staff confusion when we went and servers looked unhappy in general. Our food was ok but when I've had it at other locations it was much better. Between the below avg food and mediocre service, in my opinion I would go somewhere else. There are so many places to pick from in the strip."
"fantastic selection of chinese food, 20 tables outside for a great atmosphere on a warm night. good staff all like army soldiers & very quick, good sized portions for money.
great flavours and colours on your plate, quite good for a chain restaurant."
"The service was prompt and our waiter was great and offered great suggestions for us - we are a couple of 2.  We shared a wonderful dinner that was very tasty and exactly the right portion.  The atmosphere is great, reasonably priced.  We were seated upstairs and it wasn't too far from where were staying at Caesar's Palace.  We will definitely return and highly recommend this restaraunt."
"This a typical PF Chang restaurant right next to Planet hollywood on the strip. We have used them for takeout multiple times in the past and during this visit to Vegas, dined with them. Its better than lot of tourist trap restaurants where you end up paying for crappy food. Atlest with PF Chang you know what you are getting !!!"
"I stopped here for lunch simply because it was close and I was tired. I was not disappointed. I tried the home made ginger beer as my beverage. It had a great ginger taste and came garnished with a bit of candied ginger. 

As my meal I opted for the Mongolian beef and one of the new side dishes of Brussels sprouts. The beef was perfectly done, had lots of green onions and came served with a bowl of rice. The Brussels sprouts were delightfully crispy, evenly cooked, and combined with a bit of pineapple and few chilis. 

I had expected and average meal from a chain restaurant. What a got far exceeded my expectations and the service was very good."
"My wife and I tried to give this PF Changs one more chance since it was located in the Planet Hollywood where we were staying. Big Mistake!   It is overpriced for blah tasting and pretend oriental food.  Service was okay if you like one person to take your order and someone else to deliver your food asking you who ordered what and everything coming out at one time. Pretty much a place that wants you back out the door as soon as possible. We decided to give this another try because we received an e-mail offer of a free dessert with a dinner entree. After ordering the most expensive item on the menu, Changs Dinner For Two, we were told the coupon did not apply and that it was too bad and so sad. Well NEVER AGAIN WILL WE EAT AT A PF CHANGS. The manager on site was obnoxious and could care less about customer relations. All he wanted to do is push the food out of the kitchen as fast as possible!  StayAway!"
"We got married in Vegas in 2001 and went to PF Changs for a meal so back in Vegas we decided to visit again.
Food still good and great lunchtime specials - Mongolian beef tasty! 
Staff attentive but not overbearing, nice layout and tables not too close together.
It was the Aladdin when we first visted and is now Planet Hollywood hotel. 
Really nice to visit again and definitely worth a visit if first time in Vegas."
"Very large version of the familiar chain.  Seating on two levels.  Despite the crowd, very good service.  Lettuce wraps were excellent.  Drinks were good.

One dig, which is not unusual for a Las Vegas restaurant:  no bathrooms.  Rather, you go into the casino and wander."
"We usually stop in and eat and drink at the bar. This trip was to try some of their handcrafted cocktails on the special happy hour menu. My wife had the cucumber vodka drink, and mine was a berry vodka mix. Both very good!"
Came here famished and ordered a couple of appetizers.  Even brought my own drink in from without hassle.  Eat here.
Had a very nice dinner.  Called ahead and didn't have to wait for a table.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful with the menu.  Food was great tasting and was delivered fairly quickly.  It has a very nice romantic feel even though it is very busy.  Classy place and great food.  Dessert was great too!
"Great portions with a good beer selection. It's the standard P.F. Chang's menu, which we love. The service was very quick and courteous. We had the walnut sweet shrimp with a huge portion of combination rice. Everything was prepared perfect."
"We visited PF Chang's in Planet Hollywood Hotel in December. We had recently eaten in Raleigh with their new menu and had been a bit disappointed. I was a huge fan of their Moo Goo gai pan which is no longer on the menu. An online menu showed the meal was available at the Vegas restaurant but I must of pulled up an old menu because not available here either. My wife's favorite was also no longer served, The service and prices were excellent."
Went here for drinks and appetizers. We sat on the patio and people watched while we waited for our rooms to be ready. Our server(s) was amazing. She was super friendly and quippy (is quippy a word?) anyway....our drinks were perfect and as always PF Changs appetizers did not disappoint. Will absolutely come back to this location.
We went for an early dinner before the Britney show and the service was good and quick - food was yummy - I had the lettuce wraps and the pad thai - delicious! Would go back if we were in Vegas again
"food was very good
service was excellent. Sheila (hope I have the spelling right?) was superb with a  big capital S!!
location overlooking Las Vegas Boulevard was good"
"Visited the restaurant with a friend who had visited many times before. We were seated immediately and served quickly. The drinks arrived quickly, as did the food. However it was noted that the food was cold. Either that or because the restaurant itself was cold, the food caught a chill...

We ordered a noodle dish which was nice and the beef with broccoli, which again were nice. However the green beans in tempura batter were disappointing, lacking any flavour at all. 

Overall, slightly disappointed given a friend had raved about the food."
"The good:
- convenient location right in PH.
- clean; not the usual Asian digs

The meh:
- food is underwhelming both in portion and in taste.
- the dishes are either sweet or salt driven.  Ginger beef should have ginger as the flavour highlight...not sugar.
- Pad Thai should have a lil tamarind zing to it...not sugar.
- where's the meat in my lettuce wrap?

I've given this place another try...officially it's off my list.  It doesn't meet my FVP criteria - flavour, value, portions"
We eat here every time we go to Vegas!  The food and service are consistently excellent.  We recommend the Lettuce Wraps at happy hour.
"Great food, decent prices for being on the strip. Good service even though it was a little busy. The Orange Chicken is DIVINE! Still waiting for an American company to discover the Ginger Beef we have in Alberta, this place would make a killer Ginger Beef."
"We ate lunch here, and knew it would be delicious since we have eaten at other PF Chang's before. The food did not dissappoint, and the waiter was great. I just wish it wasn't so expensive. The lunch portion was not very big either."
"I ate here some years ago and my expectations were high and I was disappointed. The menu is OK, portions seem to be smaller than I recall and waiter was more worried about us filling in the membership card than getting our second round of drinks....that never came. The hot and sour soup was not hot (temperature) enough and the wontons the same. The sauce on the sauted spicy eggplant was too thick for my liking and again was not hot enough, nor was the rice!"
"We have a good experience with our meal except the wonton soup. Despite ordering the bigger serving, we were shock to find only 2 wonton in the soup.  A total rip off for that price!  They should stopped serving in such a big bowl if only 2 pcs are in it."
"This place is pretty busy and there are some wait times. The food is consistent with other P.F Chang's but the reality is that this is a well known chain of Chinese restaurants.
If you want value for money it is ok, you now what you will get, but if you are looking to have a nice Chinese meal there are other options which provide more of an authentic experience and some variety.
Good standard option but a chain non the less"
"Everything was very good and prices seemed reasonable, too.  Noise level was not bad and service was excellent.  Lots of good menu choices."
"We had dinner here on Nov 4 2016 after a long walk on the Strip in Las Vegas .We preferred to sit out in open to soak into the Las Vegas week end atmosphere !

Our selection included : Wok-Chrd Brussels Sprouts, Buddha's Feast, and Singaporean chicken . These went very well with our drinks --Asian Pear Mojito and Weihenstephaner Orig Dft Beer. Buddha's Feast was not that enjoyable but other two dishes were well prepared.

Service was very good in spite of week end rush. Our server Mr. Justin was very enthusiastic and friendly person .

In brief, a great place to enjoy food after roaming on the Strip ."
"This place was so crowed but we we seated quickly, food and service were great. Moscow Mule was delicious with candied ginger."
"Wife and I had early dinner here. We both had fried rice, a simple meal but excellent and satisfying. Portions were large and more than we could eat in one setting. Service was quick and friendly."
"P.F. Chang's is always a crowd pleaser.  They are a mid range restaurant to keep everyone in a group happy.  Decent selection of adult bevys and the menu has options even for the pickiest eater.  We always leave full, but never feeling gross (you know the feeling, like you can't move and need to take a nap)."
"We dropped in for a mid afternoon snack before heading out for a big night. Our server (Ozy) gave us some tip top food and drink recommendations and was an all-round legend. 

After being in the USA for 3 weeks eating, we all agreed it is our favourite meal so far. 

We ate the BBQ ribs, dynamite shrimp, steamed pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps. 

Two thumbs up."
"We ate at the P.F.Changs inside Planet Hollywood recently. The food was absolutely amazing, very high quality and worth every penny. We are tough judges of asian/cantonese food as we live in Western Sydney, Australia (many many asian restaurants everywhere here).

The lettuce cups (sang choi bau) was 5  out of 5. So fresh and clean, very tasty. A must try!

Also tried the mongolian beef - also amazing. And a chicken dish (think it was lemon chicken). Very tasty, along with their fried rice which is famous and lived up to it's name.

Had a moscow mule cocktail which was also great!

Service was top shelf too. Very nice service performance.

Will be back. Highly recommended!"
"Enjoyed sharing several plates, all very tasty. Good wait staff and reasonably priced. The noodles were special."
"Food cold and waited 30 minutes for the food to come out cold again, absolutely terrible service, please do not visit if you have any standards at all, I could safely say It's the worst place I have ever visited so there you go , try at your peril , would have been better in a food court. Awful awful awful  and worse than awful"
"I can’t go absolutely mad for P.F. Chang’s because it wasn’t stand-out, but the food was fresh, tasty, familiar and not too pricey and the vast restaurant was packed, loud and lively.

I don’t need to eat there again, but the meal we had was certainly enjoyable."
The food was really good service was ok View was great outside. We liked this place enough we ate here twice which we don't do often while traveling. The price I thought were reasonable for the strip.
"P.F Chang's is a very friendly, relaxing place for lunch or dinner.  The food is excellent, the staff attentive but not intrusive, the staff very friendly and explained menu items very well.  Next time in Las Vegas we will definitely go back."
"I went to PF Changs with my wife and some friends on a Thursday evening. Our waitress and her assistant were very entertaining and attentive. It was like they were having a contest to see who could be better. The food was also great and it was a memorable experience. I would go back in a heartbeat, loved it."
The food was great and the location is easy to get to. Prices were reasonable and the service was good.
Excellent as always! We ordered lettuce wraps and chicken soup! All were very fresh and delicious! They are open late!
"This was my second time in a PF Chang's, the first being their other Las Vegas location.  Food was consistently excellent, served HOT, and fast.  Drinks were just right. Dessert is over the top--one serving was enough for 5 of us to share. I would go back any time.  

The only weird thing about this place is there is no restroom in the restaurant.  You have to exit, go into the casino, and hunt it down.  Other than that, this would be a ""must do"" place when in Vegas."
"This is a chain but the service made it feel more local.  Friendly and attentive.  This is located at the street side of Planet Hollywood casino.  There is both inside & outside seating.  While the menu is not truly Chinese like I'm used to, which includes complimentary hot tea, they had some tasty dishes.  The lettuce wraps are yummy.  We shared the beef & broccoli and the honey chicken.  The beef was the better of the two."
"Visited here as it was convenient with close proximity to the showroom. What a wonderful choice, we made.
Everything from being greeted to the end was splendid.
The food was prepared just right and delicious. The drinks were made just right. We totally recommend this place if you find yourself close to PH!"
I normally don't frequent chain restaurants while on vacations. I prefer to find unique local establishments but I wasn't having much luck finding gluten free selections in Vegas. PF Chang's is my go to for gluten free Asian cuisine and I was not disappointed. The decor was very nice. It's probably the largest one I've been in (there's a second level) and it has a good atmosphere.
"We love PF Chang's in the US. The place has a great location and nice seating outside. 

Good was OK (notch above fast food). 

Service was little slow and the glasses were dirty, but the manager gave us a credit for our wine and offered desert for kids. 

Not bad fast food."
"No matter where in the world, P.F. Chang's is always so yummy!! Amazing food, amazing drinks, great service!! Just all around good!! I would highly recommend the tempura green beans to start, so tasty, we always get them!"
"This was our first visit to any of the Chang restaurants, so I can't compare to others, but the food was pretty good and the service was excellent, although they were quite busy at lunchtime. Loved the lettuce wraps."
"If you are on the Strip and hungry, you will definitely have an amazing food here. Of course, many of us would be used to or experienced this restaurant before in other locations, but this particular joint is conveniently located in the Planet Hollywood, which is almost in heart of the strip and accessible from most of the casinos nearby."
"Had an awesome waiter on the outside patio on Oct 5, 2016 at 5:55 pm - George. The service he provided was above our expectations.  He was prompt, courteous and fun to have as our waiter. Food, as always, was superb.  No better place to eat right in the middle of LasVegas Blvd.  The place to eat every time we're in Vegas."
Nice restaurant. Inside of Planet Hollywood Casino. Was seated straight away. Food came quick free refills. Server was attentive. Good food. Will come again.
Sat at a table outside. The weather was perfect for having a lunch outside. The food was standard P. F. Chang quality and service was attentive.
"My friend recommended that we have dinner at this restaurant. This was my first time... amazing food, amazing wine that was recommended by our server... what a wonderful experience. I would love to see this restaurant come to Calgary."
P.F. Chang's more than met it's reputation for great food. The servers were very attentive and quality of food was very good for a reasonable price at lunch time
"The restaurant was very crowded so we offered a seat at the bar upstairs, Half empty, the bartenders were very friendly and we received our food very fast. The food was excellent as usual and we had a good time talking to the bartender and enjoyed his company. If you are in a hurry, best place to get quick service"
"I must admit that with my wife's obsession with PF Chang, I kinda got tired of it and wanted to avoid but we came here for lunch and I'm ALL IN again. The service was amazing. We sat outside so you gotta love Las Vegas people watching (or were they watching us?). The food was perfect. We had the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Mongolian Beef, and a new dish, the wok fired filet. All were terrific and big portions. A great lunch in Planet Hollywood."
I have celiacs and this place offers gluten free menu which is hard to find in Vegas. I have eaten here several times and never gotten sick from cross contamination. The food is high quality and freshly made. I wish there was one where I live!
"Not the usual PF Chang standard of fresh food, our meals were swimming in oil and could not be eaten. This restaurant appears to be a pick up place for bachelor and bachelorette parties!"
"Located strategically u can have a quiet dinner inside the restaurant, enjoy the table overlooking the casino or in the open right on the strip not missing the fun on the road
I was served cold meal but on pointing out was changed immediately. 
Good options for the vegans"
"Its a chain restaurant. If you're on the strip and want a great happy hour, this is the place to go on weekdays without a long wait.  Weekends are quite packed and a long wait. Bar seating offers faster service."
"My wife and I both chose salads, a healthy and a quick choice given we were short of time. However, there were several key ingredients missing from both salads e.g no walnuts in a waldorf salad. The manager offered to change and we choose simply to have the ingredients added to our existing salad. However, in a restaurant with such a good reputation it was both a surprise and disappointment."
"Very busy place, wonderful menu a little pricey but good portions very taste awesome presentation modern fusion"
"We visited P.F. Chang's twice and had to wait 30 minutes both times because we did not have a reservation...but it was well worth the weight. If you can, request a table outside so you can watch the nutters go by and the street performers."
"I've been there so many times, and the menu has a little bit for everyone, won tan soup is gooood, and the potstickers even better, if  you go you have to try the Great Wall of chocolate, the best chocolate cake ever!"
"The lettuce wraps and their version of chicken noodle soup were absolutely wonderful. We do not have a PF Changs were we live in Canada (Not sure if they are even in Canada), but we had heard good things about them. We will definitely go back on our next visit."
"Food is overall great.  Have been here several times over the past few years.

In general the food has been consistent, although this time the food seemed saltier than usual. 

We got the oolong sea bass which was great, and it came with a generous bed of spinach.  You will unlikely need any other veggies unless you hate spinach.

Pad Thai was too saucy and salty, but would have been amazing otherwise.

I never understood why each dish comes with its own side bowl of rice (even the pad thai), but if rice is your thing you will be quite pleased.

Prices are quite decent considering it is located on the strip at a prime location.

Drinks are in general good.  

Service is reasonably fast, so if you have any shows to attend this would be a reasonable pre-show dining option."
"I've been there so many times, and the menu has a little bit for everyone, won tan soup is gooood, and the potstickers even better, if  you go you have to try the Great Wall of chocolate, the best chocolate cake ever!"
"Great restaurant, best was that it was also included on the room service menu as were most of the main restaurants at the resort."
"We were in town for the JLo show and we had dinner here. The service was great and it was conveniently close to Planet Hollywood which is where the concert was. The food was average, not hot just warm and it was a bit over priced."
"Lovely relaxed atmosphere mixed with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant environment. The food was brilliant, we ordered a variety of dishes to share between four of us, which I would highly recommend as you can try a bit of everything, as there is so much choice. My husband had a pork dish which he very much enjoyed and I ordered a fish fillet on a bed of spinach which was incredible and prawns which were crunchy and fresh. We tried a variety of cocktails from the menu which were very nice. Reasonably priced and excellent service. Highly recommended."
"PF Changs was not as good as nearly everywhere else we ate in in Las Vegas.  The food was acceptable, but nothing special.  The service, however, was truly poor.  Plates were placed without saying what they were and with a rushed approach.  Most alarmingly, when we were paying by card, the waitress took the card away from the table so quickly that we could not follow - not acceptable in this day and age!"
"We were greeted immediately and shown our table.
The Hostess ""Mara"" was excellent, she explained all the menu items to us and even suggested a locally brewed beer to taste, which was great BTW. 
at the end of our meal she gave us a discount on our meal and made it one of the best meals we had while we were in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place."
My husband and I ate here while on vacation. Great service and I ordered a dish that was 3 glasses of water hot but worth it.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant
"Huge restaurant very busy resulting in a very loud atmosphere. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the service as the waitress didn't know the menu for allergens. We were served the wrong main meal resulting in all our sides going cold  no offer to replace our sides while waiting over 25mins for the correct order.
Attitude from service member very dismissive just too much trouble to bother with customers.
Shame about this visit. Newport Beach location was a totally different restaurant experience they were great, Las Vegas very very poor!"
"Although many places have lettuce wraps now, this is one of the best.   Disappointing at this location they don't mix up special sauce for you like they have elsewhere.   But you can ask for chili oil and kind of make your own.   The $49 value meal for 2 is a good deal if you are big eaters:  2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 dessert.   The ginger chicken was better the next day.   The street noodles were good and different with a fine noodle and chicken plus shrimp."
"First night in Vegas and picked this to avoid having to wait too long for a table. It was a winning decision, prompt, efficient service and the food was very good.Was so impressed that we returned on our last st night also."
"My wife and I where there this afternoon. We were told that it was the best place for Chinese food. Well, nobody came to get even an order for drinks, and there wasn't even that much people! every one in there, starting with the hostess, have a really bad attitude as if we, the guests, were a burden. 
We'll never go back there."
"We bought two dinners for two giving us four different enter dishes to share. We were stuffed.
The soups were excellent as were the lettuce wraps (our favorites) . The beef and broccoli was amazing as were the pork and chicken dishes.
The staff were also extremely attentive and helpful to our allergy issues.
We have never been disappointed when we go to this chain."
"Noodles with shrimp and chicken. And sweet and sour chicken
Just good   They always keep good standards.  Sometimes servers are like robots. But food quality is what you hope to be"
"Ate here last Wednesday.
The food was great and the price acceptable ($100 and change for 3 adults).
The service was efficient,friendly and worth the tip.
We are the spicy prawns as a starter and they were first class, but then all the food was delicious. 
Go there, try it. You won't be disappointed"
"We went there during happy hour which is amazing. Great selection of Foods n drinks only $8. Must try their signature dish Lettuce wrap tasted amazing!! also the spicy chicken wings soo yummy, not that spicy for us coz we love spicy food might be spicy for people who dont eat spicy food. Waiters there so great, all bubbly n friendly. Our waiter Lee giving us an excellent customer service!! Gave us such a great food recommendations. Definitely we will go back to try more dishes."
"It is just a chain with no outstanding food. We were looking for a place to eat fast without long lines after a full day of travel and we hit the right spot, but you don't need to go to Las Vegas to eat at this reastaurant. Nonetheless, the service was fast and freindly despite the crowds."
"Ate here one night, Moroccan beef and ginger chicken, both really good. Great service, weren't rushed to leave when our food was done as we had wine left. Went back the following night after an abortive meal at a different place, second night was even better. Shared three mains, and had a Pinot Noir (Siduri, great with the pepper steak) served at the correct temperature, which is so rare. We now have a go to place in Vegas again."
"We have been to Vegas before and had loved PF Chang on our last visit. So we had been looking forward to going back. It didn't disappoint, we booked a table, and were glad we did, as it was very busy when we arrived. We had chicken lettuce wraps, kung pao chicken and sesame chicken and all of the food was delicious. I had mushrooms removed from my dish, which they were happy to do. Great value for money too, as the portions were huge. Definitely one to go back to."
"Located in the Planet Hollywood Casino, PF Changs cranks out some decent Chinese food being that it's a chain restaurant. There are a lot of nice selections to choose from and notably one of the best is their Chilean Sea Bass. Served over a bed of spinach with a tasty sauce, you can't go wrong. Their hot and sour soup rivals some of the best Chinese versions, it's a must to try! The service here was a bit lacking in that our server didn't check with us about our meal and seemed nowhere to be found if we had a question or request. Granted you can go to Chinatown and get a comparable meal at a cheaper price, however the overall dining experience and ambiance is worth the money."
"We went as a group of 6 and arrived 15 minutes before happy hour. After an initial round of drinks, we ordered several appetizers and they were all fabulous.  Atmosphere was fun and the service was excellent."
Food fab as usual . Always visit one of their restaurants in America and Dubai .great service and food reasonably prices.
"We had another lovely meal at PF Changs 😄

The food is always good but the service tends to be disorganised when we are there, we have never figured out why, it just seems to be that way.

We both ordered appetisers, one arrived and the other came at the same time as the entree which was frustrating, that was despite the server saying he had slowed the main meal coming out to give us time to enjoy our appetisers.

It detracted a little away from the overall dining and enjoyment of th experience but the food was tasty as always, hence why we go back time and time again and there were also some new options added to the menu which we tried and thoroughly enjoyed.   Very tasty.

The staff were friendly and helpful despite their hectic surroundings 😄"
"The service here was really good and attentive but the food wasn't all that, it all tasted a bit fake and I won't be going back, planet Hollywood casino is nice though, I know this as you have to walk through there to use the WC's !"
"Our server was Ivan, he was excellent. Helpful & knowledgeable. We had the lettuce veggie wraps; so good I've made them at home since returning to UK. We then had honeyed shrimp noodles & seared salmon with rice. Kirin to drink, what's not to like. 
Good, quick, filling & cheap food for the Vegas strip. Definitely would recommend."
"PF Chang's is a chain place we actually love. We normally steer clear of chains, but this place is just so unique with their Asian influence menu. We love it. 
We always start with their chicken lettuce wraps and go from there. 
Today we had lunch sitting out on their patio. Great food.  Awesome service and truly interesting people watching on the strip. 
Check it out.  At Planet Hollywood Casino"
The food was great and the service was good. We were not ignored as our waiter looked after us. Its located in Planet Hollywood. Our wait time on Labor day weekend was abot 20 mins and we were seated promptly
"It has been four months since my wife and I last visited PF Chang's Bistro in Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas Strip. Each time we go, we ask ourselves why have we waited so long. Today's lunch was made more enjoyable by our waiter Ozy. This young man has thorough knowledge of the menu. He made a suggestion for my wife - Spicy Chicken - which she tried and couldn't stop raving. I went with Pepper Steak and it was delightful. We started with our customary Salt & Pepper Calamari which could be a meal by itself - must share or one won't have room for lunch or dinner. 

When one receives her/his check, she/he will be pleasantly surprised to see how reasonable the prices are for a Strip location. The atmosphere is most pleasant."
"Great dinner experience at Changs as usual.
Restaurant is always busy (usually a good pointer) but seated efficiency and looked after attentively by a friendly server.
Food is excellent but be aware portions are generous.
Recommended."
"Our first visit to P.F Chang's and it was fantastic. Great, attentive service, great quality and taste and really good price.

We ordered the honey chicken, salad, and two starters and tea - costing not much more than $50US. 

Our waitress was fantastic and very friendly, checking in on us every now and then.

Highly recommend P.F Chang's for anyone visiting Vegas."
The dish I had was okay maybe the other items on the menu would have been better. Nice crowd. not a long wwait for a seat.

"I called here after walking miles up and down the strip and had spotted there were some decent vegetarian options in the menu. The place was packed but the greeting staff were very nice and managed to find a table for one for me straight away which was great. 

The atmosphere was nice and the food was delicious, I had veggie spring rolls, Buddha's delight and rice. 

The waiter on the other hand was awful, I'm not sure if it was because I was eating alone (not that that should make any difference) as he was chatty with everyone else he was serving around me but was surly and barely made eye contact whenever he came over to me, when he plonked my wine on the table some splashed over the side into the table - I'm not even sure he noticed because he didn't bother to clean it up. My second glass of wine came in a plastic cup - obviously I wasn't expected to be staying at my table to drink it! It should have been a nice meal but he spoiled it for me, needless to say he got the bare minimum tip. 

I was going to mention it as I was leaving the restaurant but it was still very busy with new customers coming in and I was so fed up I couldn't be bothered waiting."
"I was told this restaurant is better than Panda Express .  Not really.  I order two noodle dishes. They are nasty. Both noodle has very strong sauce which took over their original flavor.  I tasted very strong sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar.
Our waitress asked me whether I like to take the left over or not.  I said, ""no thank you!""  I don't want eat it again😑"
"The night started out well, seated at our table 15 minutes early. It's always busy but it was no excuse for the poor service. Waited a long time for our waitress to come by. Ordered drinks and that took awhile. While waiting a server dropped full drinks beside our table and crash! We did not get cut by the glass but definitely my legs got splashed. Cleanup crew came but you think they would offer you a towel or wipes to clean up. Finally ordered our food and waited and waited. Food finally arrived and were told they ran out of brown rice. We were also short one dish. When we were done eating the last dish and the brown rice came. At least we weren't charged for these. 
The food is always consistently good at PF Changs."
"Was on here on a business trip. The food was fantastic, and the service (while very busy) was great."
Best place on the strip for a healthy meal. 5-star service and good food fast.  Try the ginger chicken and the honey chicken were our favs.
Tried here for the first time last night and loved it!  Will always dine here when I'm in Las Vegas.  Its also surprisingly easy on the pocket which is an added bonus!  Highly recommend!
"My wife and I always head to PF Changs when visiting the US. Love the food.
In this trip to Vegas we ate there twice, and the only suggestion I would make to visitors/restaurant is to ease off on the air con. Coming from a sweltering strip into a very cool restaurant might be pleasant for some, but we wished we'd brought our hoodies!"
"Since I was here on business and didn't feel like spending a whole lot of $ I chose to hit up P.F. Chang's with my wife.  The food is decent and easy on the stomach.  It was busier than I expected, but our server William was great.  He helped guide me to a good local beer, and with the lettuce wraps my wife and I were able to split our main course.  Able to escape all in for under $50 including food and 2 beers."
"Service was great. From the time we walked in to make the reservation to the time we left they were there to serve you. Come hungry as it is served family style. Food was fresh, hot and delicious."
PF Changs is not one of my favorite resturaunts in Las Vegas. The place is usually crowded and the food is plain
"We had another great meal at PF Chang's here in Las Vegas. We shared orange peel chicken, honey chicken & shrimp fried rice & a bottle of Pino Grigio. The food was very fresh , tasty and good quality. Our last meal here was in 2014 on a previous visit from Australia. This restaurant is a priority on our to do list when in Las Vegas. Service is good and the menu offers plenty of choice."
"This place is very nice and the staff was very accommodating because we had her to your grandma's with us and they kept her stroller up and we're very helpful. We ordered quite a bit of food. Seafood mainly, prawns, lobster...  The servers were very nice and helpful. It was a good evening there until I got back to the hotel room and found out that the server had failed to pack the rest of my uneaten meal to carry out! Upon making this discovery I called PF Chang and I was immediately connected with a manager she was so kind and nice and understanding she apologized and replace the missing meals with a gift card. I really like this deal like I said it will be happy to serve as a lovely lovely place."
"We love this place, the food is fresh, service is fantastic and atmosphere is perfect blend of bustle without being too noisy or rowdy. 

I would start by picking out the best things on the menu but this would be like picking out your favourite child (you may have a favourite child but you can't say as the others maybe offended) this is how I feel about the dishes. There are always the regular dishes however there are new additions of drinks and dishes that avoid the 'chain establishment complacency' that make it so easy for large chain establishments. 

Fellow customers can sit at the bar and chat and dine or you can have the more traditional setting of a seated table with a host, both are equally as attentive and therefore down to personal preference. 

Only issue for me is that year on year as an International visitor there is no option to join the rewards program,me, we are pretty loyal customers when in the states and it is a little disappointing we cannot recieve the benefits that other guests do. Other than that - great."
Good quality food. The honey chicken is always a winner. We got takeaway and took it back to our hotel (Elara). Recommended.
"Gorgeous food... Full of flavour and character. Not sure how close this is to the authentic feel of east Asia, but the food was well prepared, presented and quick.

The waiter was attentive and regularly served us. The price was great. For two alcoholic beverages, starter and two entrees this was $77 with tip, so go here if you're looking for flavoursome Asian inspired food at an affordable cost."

"We decided to try this restaurant after looking at the menu the night before and not being able to find a decently priced restaurant that at least offered one vegetarian option. We came here and didn't regret it. We ordered starters, which included lettuce wraps, which we had never tried before ever and were full just from them! We maybe shouldn't have had them as we were quite full so portions are huge. We had rice along with our mains. I had tofu, which was done in a sauce which I liked. Excellent service and food!"
"Normally we like PFChang's but our experience late one evening was not good. Ordered Won Ton Soup and it was terrible.  Literally one won ton and a terrible broth. Waitress apologized, we sent it back. The Orange chicken only a bit better. Beer was fine as was the water. Waitress tried but it was clear the kitchen couldn't or didn't.  Not coming back to this location anytime soon."
Had soup and dim sum.  They have on line ordering.  It can also be ordered as room service through Planet Hollywood.
"Excellent food, very good service, fresh tasting food, very good variety on menu.
Good happy hour pricing"
The food was good but not amazing. I had a mojito that didnt taste very good. And the service was quite slow.
"This place is great! Being from Canada, we never get Chinese like this. Had the most amazing shrimp dish this time. the chicken fried rice is a must. Never had a bad meal here and always stop in when in Vegas."
"We always make a point of visiting P.F. Changs on our first night in Las Vegas to start the vacation off right (and often go again before we leave). The food is always fresh, hot and delicious with a great variety of options. We have never received anything but the BEST service - efficient, helpful and friendly. My go to favourite is the Egg Drop Soup, so flavourful and perfect silky texture (ask for crispy noodles to sprinkle)."
We were very hungry and ready for some tea. we walked past this restaurant outside planet hollywood and glad we dinner. we had a beef dish and chicken and prawn pad thai. both were  amazing. good service and excellent food. the restaurant was new and well decorated.
"Booked ahead of time as I know how busy Friday night in Vegas can be 
Seated in a timely manner and ordered drinks from waitress
As a regular to Changs we knew what we wanted to order as it doesn't really change
When I ordered 2 kids size Lo Mein the waitress became very touchy saying the kids were too old . My request was for portion size and not to save money .
She used the the expression ""technically"" 3 times ie .. ""Technically you are not allowed "" which was quite annoying 
She walked over to a gaggle of servers and begun to talk about us , with the other servers gossiping over their shoulders 
I got up from my seat and asked if I could join in , to which she became all flustered and lied that she wasn't discussing us
I said to cancel the kids Lo Mein and bring us an adult portion ... As well as the manager 
Now the arrogant manager done his crouching down at the table bit to make the customer feel in control and proceeded to preach about how the sever was new and that I shouldn't really get up from my seat and intimidate the server ... What rubbish .. Perhaps the server shouldn't talk about the customers !!
Food was OK in the end served by a different server but the damage was done ...
Server was rude , Manager was patronising ....Do they care ....nah ... Next customer ... All about da money"
"We had never been to this restaurant before and I am generally not a big fan of chain restaurants but my husband and I were very impressed.  It had a nice atmosphere and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Particularly for Vegas, it was good value and they offered wines that were good and reasonable....NOT starting at $125 (with a 300% markup !!)
Our mains were attempted to be served prior to our appetizer (no big deal for us particularly as they took them back to redo and bring after the appetizer) but they still comped us with a $20 voucher for our next visit.
We were very impressed with that."
"This was my second visit to PF Chang in Las Vegas. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the veggie spring rolls & the spicy chicken soup. The spring rolls were light and very tasty. The soup was huge and served in a cup but spoons it from a large covered pot.,I couldn't finish it, but the soup was excellent. Service was good and this place won't break the bank. Recommended."
A very busy restaurant on the strip especially at night. Even tho it was busy we got a table quickly and the server was great. Lots of variety on the menu. Prices wee reasonable. Very clean restaurant and the service was awesome. I recommend this place for a good meal.
"At lunch you get large portions same thing at dinner much more expensive, we try and go everytime we go to Vegas they now have a member card and when you get to certain amount you get a free food appy and on birthday you get something as well. 
We usually get a couple things, love the lettuce wrap the best and almond chicken is also great the meals get rice for free with them as well so don't over order or you will be
taking food back to your hotel .  As well lunch time there usually is not as long of wait time to get into the restaurant"
"Friendly staff and ""regular"" P.F. Chang experience. No bad surprises at this branch of the famous chain."
Came after reading great reviews and for handiness before J LO show that night! First impressions made me want to run -and should`ve. Disorganised. Sown by a surly waitress a dirty table and seats. Waiter was lovely when he eventually came!! Many disgruntled customers that night. Food eventually came at different times and wrong-all meals arrived cold. Had to send them all back after speaking to the manager. No reduction in bill. I felt really bad as was our only bad experience in our Vegas stay and I had organised it all-girls tried to laugh it off but I was horrified. Will never be back!!!
"Anytime I go to Vegas I can't not go here atleast once for dinner. 
We usually need to wait 10 minutes to get a table but happy to wait as the food is always delicious and staff are very attentive :)"
"All P.F. Chang's are the same. However, this location was very knowledgable about gluten-free requirements. They even prepare gluten-free meals in a separate location to ensure that there is no cross-contamination. I felt that of all of the P.F. Chang's I have been to, this restaurant had the best service. I will return!"
"My husband and I went to this restaurant 6 years ago and the food was excellent, so we have just come to Vegas again for a holiday and decided to go back to this restaurant and see if was just as good, oh my days we was not disappointed another great meal we have eaten there twice already. Definitely a must if you visit Vegas."
"Food was tasty, from the starter to the main course. Service was fast and efficient and price was very reasonable for las vegas. Would go again!"
"This was our second visit and it was every bit as good as the first.  The servers are all very friendly and professional.  We were seated promptly without a reservation.

We ordered 4 different dishes and they were all scrumptious.  This is easily one of our favourite Chinese restaurants and has never failed to deliver excellent food and excellent service.  You can't go wrong with this restaurant."
"We frequent PF Chang all across the country... this was our very first!  Then on to Chicago suburbs, NYC Suburbs, NJ, NC, Buford, GA, et al.  Love the Orange Shrimp & Lettuce Wraps (NOT the Vegetarian = yucky)."
Outstanding food! Excellent service! Highly recommend this PF Chang's. Chicken lettuce wraps were delish.
Was there 3 times - everything was delicious and fresh - great Chinese food - great service.  Love the shrimp with lobster sauce - ask for extra sauce -- and the spare ribs
"Always a fun dining experience when we are able to visit we do.  Dinner for two $49.00 included appetizer, 2 entrees, soup and dessert to share.  Delicious and very filling.  Great service also.  My husband says their Mongolian beef is the best he's ever."
"Wondering around Vegas in a group can be super hard to decide where to eat and P.F.Changs has always been a safe bet. Last night though not only was the food amazing (I had the sesame chicken and it's the first meal I've finished in weeks) the service was unreal. 
The restaurant was pretty busy so we were expecting slightly rushed service but Tammy who was our server took such good care of us constantly refilling our glasses and checking we were doing okay.
Definitely one of the best meals out I've had for a while!"
About 40 of us went to dinner here after a wedding and had a great time.  The food was fantastic and the waiters that we had couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating.  We loved it.
PF Chang's offers consistently good food and service at a very reasonable price- definitely worth a visit while in Vegas
"Enjoyed a quick informal lunch at the bar seating. Happy Hour Monday to Friday but they've removed the popular BBQ Ribs as an option.  Coupons available in Vegas booklets giving free appetisers which then works out better than the happy hour and is a 7 day a week offer. Prices have shot up over the last couple of years with the large Tsing Tao beer at $6 replaced by the same sized $11 Sapporo beer. 

Bar area can get very busy at peak times but at quiet times be prepared to be talked to death by bored staff who ask impersonal questions such as; where do you live, where do you work and how much do you earn....

On the ""will return"" list."
The food was fresh and quite nice. The staff were great. They were friendly and very attentive. The price for the food and drinks was very reasonable for being located on the Vegas Strip.
PF Chang's offers consistently good food and service at a very reasonable price- definitely worth a visit while in Vegas
Ask for upstairs tables by windows for great view of strip and people watching.   Always delicious generous portions. They offer the $59.99 dinners for two which is the best deal you will find on the strip. We had a great waitress named brittney
"I've been to several pf changs & this location is as good as they get. Fast, friendly service, food as good as you'll get at the better locations. Get the dinner for 2 ($50 is cheap in casinos). Broccoli-beef, or Kung pow chicken or Buddha feast (lots of vegetables) then add a meat...order the chicken lettuce wraps for appetizer. Best vegas meal I've had in years!!!"
great place....good pricing and great service....we actually could not finish all the food! absolutely will go back....P.F Chang's is more of a family style eating place
"Since there are P.F. Changs in just about every state, we are familiar with the food and knew what to order. However, this time there were added ingredients to the Sweet and Sour Chicken which was some kind of red ginger? We first thought it was a red bell pepper as it looked the same. But when we bit into the red thing it had a taste like a chemical. Like it had been sprayed with bug spray or something. It left an awful taste in our mouths. We finally asked what it was and the server told us it is red ginger. I am a food connoisseur and have never had red ginger taste like bug spray. The service was mediocre but the server did do everything we asked and supplied all we needed. It was just a bit slow."
"We were walking down the strip looking for delicious, fresher food that what we'd been eating and we stumbled across P.F.Changs. The food here is so tasty and there's actual vegetables not cooked in butter. As a healthy eater I loved how tasty and fresh everything was!"
Had an awesome dinner with our friends!  Both the food and the service was great!  Would definitely eat here again.
We stopped in for a quick bite around 3:00 pm.  We were seated quickly and served promptly.  We ordered the chicken with cashews and the spicy grew beans.  Both dished were served quickly and were hot.  The flavour was great!
"So that was our choice today for lunch when we didn't know whereto eat. We had many dishes, various choices. We were seated directly no waiting list. The waiter was so kind and helpful was updating us on the food. Recommend!"
"Was late and want to have a dinner 
After the trip,
Was busy the give us the worst table in the house,
But was ok just A dinner,
We wait for someone to say it 
Hi I'm your server,
25 minute,
Spice tuna roll was ok 
Lettuce with chicken was better 
The lobster fried rice bland
Tasteless,
Not the best experience,"
"Being European we didn't realise that this was a chain restaurant, however we didn't notice and it felt very personable. The food was great

We had the meal for two - soups, lettuce wraps ( appetizers) , Mongolian beef & spicy chicken ( entrees with free rice) and a banana fritter to share for dessert. This was $50

We also had a bottle of rose wine for $20 which was sweet and fruity ( it went kinda well with the oriental flavours)

Our server was great and very attentive"
I have visited this place everytime i go to vegas you wont be disapointed. I first eat here in hawaii so when i found out they had one in vegas i made sure i went. The plate fulls are massive you wont leave hungry. The staff are very friendly and the place is always mobbed.You can sit at the bar if you dont want to wait for a table.
"Good atmosphere and not too busy with good service. Nice G&T cocktails to start followed by the mandatory lettuce cups and some sushi. Delicious Kung Pao chicken as a main which comes with rice. Good choices of accompanying wine. All in all, a VERY good choice which is surprisingly good value for the strip."
"This restaurant is an absolute must, huge menu choice of great value food, great staff too, put this place at the top of the list for places to eat while in Vegas, you will not be disappointed!"
"I love PF Chang's. They have such a convenient menu for those with allergies and REAL food with little to guess what's in the recipe. Service this time was just OK, though usually service is wonderful. Great serve time and good prices!"
"Visited recently and it is as busy as ever; I don't think I have ever been to this location when it is not completely packed. Certainly gives it a lively atmosphere and the location is a great option if you are seeing a concert or show at Planet Hollywood. Their Wok-fired filet mignon is one of my new favorites, the Pad Thai and the lettuce wraps are just as good as I remember them. We made reservations and were seated immediately; service was very fast and efficient. Would recommend if you are looking for Asian food at a reasonable (Vegas Strip) price."
"This is one of my favorite Chinese Restaurants.  Get the Lettuce Wraps to start for an appetizer to share with the table.  The atmosphere is low to medium lighting, and sophisticated.  Very clean look.  The food is always high quality, and the service is excellent.  Every time I go here, I always want to come back again as soon as possible."
"You've seen them everywhere, but not all are equal.  At this place, competing with top chefs on the strip, they seem to have elevated everything - the quality of food, the presentation and the service.  We sat at the bar, but felt as welcomed and pampered as those who had a reservation.  The servers were attentive and the food was served in an order that allowed us to savor the dish, but also taste the next one.  It's a nice place, well designed and attractive."
"Been there three times and each time is great!
Simple and great cooked chineese dishes.
Tasty and fresh! 
The ambience is nice but still is a place where you can get a quick lunch or dinner and never get disappointed and is not very pricey. 
Both of my dishes where great!"
Delicious Chinese style food that uses good quality fresh ingredients. Good service in spite of it being busy. Good atmosphere and centrally located on the Strip. Worth a 15 min wait if you don't have a booking and a table is not immediately available.
"This is always my first stop when going to Vegas! The service is good, always get a table pretty quickly. I always want to try a different dish but Mongolian beef always wins out! I ordered the green beans as a starter for something different and they were superb. I went twice in my 3 days in Vegas! I will be back :)"
"PF Chang's never ever disappoints. From great service to delicious fresh hot food. My wife and I come here every time we go to Las Vegas. 

The restaurant is accessible from the Strip or directly from inside the Planet Hollywood casino. Sign up for their free rewards program, it is totally worth it. 

This visit to Vegas we came twice to PF Chang's. Both Ozy and Ray who served us were fantastic. The food was outstanding like it is every time we come here. I cannot say enough good things about this location. Arguably the best value on the strip."
"I stopped into PF on my way out to the airport and I was really glad that I did. The food was delicious, as usual. I was able to get a seat at the bar as I was alone and kinda pressed for time. The service was great and the restaurant was warm and inviting."
"My wife and I ate at PF Chang during happy hour on July 6 2016.  We ordered a variety of small plates.  We tried the shrimp and pork Dim Sum, Chicken Satay, egg rolls, crab Won Tons and Lettuce wraps.

All the food was really hot and really good.  We ate so much but enjoyed every dish.  The service was excellent as well, from the moment we walked in we felt taken care of.

Excellent food, great service and nice atmosphere.  I will definitely be back here on my next Vegas trip."
"If you don't want tp try something new or just are craving PF Chang's this location in Planet Hollywood does not disappoint.
They also deliver to the poker area!"
"Everything excellent including service.  Brown rice and quinoa served with dinner of walnut shrimp,  ribs, broccoli chicken,  it was nice"
Food was okay but nothing great.  The fast food at Panda Express has more flavor which is not saying much.
Located in the Planet Hollywood casino it is usually pretty busy but it's a large place so it's usually not more than a 15-20min wait. Service is great and food is amazing! If you're on the second floor some tables have great views overlooking the strip.
"Food is always good here - very consistent!   Great service, great value.   I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef & Sweet & Sour Chicken, but don't forget your veggies - the asparagus & green beans are spectacular!"
Walking the Strip and stopping in Planet Hollywood Casino to find PF Changs was a great find.  We know the menu and can count on the Lettuce Wraps to start. The service was quick and good - the food was just the way we would expect it.  Good choice for food you can count on.
"It was an amazingly busy night from them, which it always is! 

They put up a table specially for us on the side, under the stairs. The lovely service followed by the lovely food! Got me ready for an all nighter on the strip."
"This was our first time at a PF Changs.  We ate here twice as the food was so good.  Modern, fresh Chinese food.  Absolutely delicious.  Great service as well.  Couldn't believe it was a chain.  Wish there was one in the UK!"
"I had an order of egg rolls.  They were fresh, crispy and full of meat.  Some of the best egg rolls I have ever eaten."
PF Changs is PF Changs no matter where you go!  Great atmosphere here at this PF Changs.  Easy location to get in and out quickly before a show!
"Last night in Vegas... Was in PH so...

As always the lettuce wrap was perfect !

Then I tried one of their new entrees- Dali Chicken, wawoooooo!!

Service was g r e a T

So was the atmosphere 

Pricing was fair 

Very recommended!!"
"I have Celiac Disease, and I had a lot of options, but the waitress was unfriendly, and the food was tasteless, which is very odd for me to say at any restaurant.
No one at our table enjoyed the food. The margarita we had for dessert was excellent, but it was 10.5 dollars for a very small margarita, which came in a regular glass, with almost no salt. Disappointing."
"Amazing! The customer service was top notch! The waiter made a paper napkin rose saying congratulations - it was super sweet. The blueberry cucumber cocktail was so refreshing. Our group of 11 was served quickly. All the food was great - we had lettuce wraps, fried rice, California rolls, spicy tuna rolls, lobster rolls and much more. The sushi melted in your mouth it was so fresh. I wish they had this in Canada. I will definitely go back again without thinking twice."
"I ordered the California roll as an appetizer. Sorry you only see one. It comes 8 to an order and was delicious. My main course was the beef and vegetable Lo Mein. Most excellent. I understand that they are in most cities. If you have not been, go."
"Located in the Planet Hollywood one mile mall. It is reasonably priced, the portions were large enough to share and the service was good."
"Late night dinner after comedy show at the V Comedy Club.  My sister recommended we split the large fried green beans (for 4 of us) and they were awesome - first time I've ever had them (and cannot wait to get them the next time we visit), egg drop soup (again, split a large - was very good), and chicken lettuce wraps (2 split - these are also a favorite).  My brother-in-law also enjoyed the pork fried rice while my husband liked the flaming red wontons dish.  Great service and great food."
"The food here was the best tasting Chinese, and I have eaten A LOT of Chinese.  It's so fresh and absolutely flavoursome.  The Chinese Red Wine and Pepper Beef was delicious, and we also loved the Spicy Chicken.  I think you could have anything and enjoy it.

Kids menu fantastic, and so refreshing for then to have a healthy meal and skip a burger!"
"I couldn't wait to eat here after all the great reviews on Tripadvisor and it did not disappoint. As recommended by other reviewers we had the chicken lettuce cups to start which were beautiful, so tasty and that crunch...yum!! We had the peppered beef and sesame chicken, they were amazing! Portions were huge but we finished every bit as it was to good to waste."
Very solid quality you would expect and not crowded. Surprised that the margarita here was excellent!
The service here was great and the food is very good.  We had a reservation and were seated right away.  Our waitress was funny and friendly and the meal did not disappoint.
"I have found this restaurant to be one of the most reliable in terms of quality, selection, atmosphere, service and price. I visit every time l am in Vegas and have never been disappointed. Great casual, chic, restaurant good for singles, couples, families or large parties. Equally good for lunch, dinner or late night snack. Some of my fav's are the lettuce wraps, Changs chicken and the rice bowls."
We had a wonderful meal at PF Chang.  If you like oriental food you can not go wrong stopping there for dinner.
"PF Chang's is one of our regular stopping places for a delicious dinner while in Vegas. Service is fabulous as is the food. Great for a Quick dinner (or lunch) as meals seem to arrive quickly.... Not a long lingering romantic dinner spot. Inexpensive and delicious!  Prefer inside to the patio here...outside tables and chairs are more like a cafeteria, on the strip but no atmosphere and not very comfy."
"I first discovered pf changs last time I was in vegas and this was high on my list on my return.i was on my own so I sat at the bar this time..
bar tenders was friendly and service was the usual  fast and efficient 
I had the salt and pepper prawns which was huge portion for $20 dollars."
"This was my first time at this place, It was recommended to me and I see why. Food is really good at a fair price. Staff is very friendly ! Definitely I will come back !"
"We ate outside here and had a great night, our server (Donald? I think) was amazing and spent a lot of time talking us through the menu and recommending dishes. We went with his recommendations of the Mongolian beef and the Korean chicken stir fry with white rice. Dishes were roughly $18 dollars each with rice so fairly cheap. The beef in particular was amazing and the chicken was also good but I wouldn't order the chicken again. 

Definitely recommend this place if you like good, late night Chinese food!"
We went to Chang's for dinner and like other identical restaurants we have visited elsewhere in the past it was excellent. The restaurant is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel block. It is very light and clean with plenty of space between tables. When we visited it was not busy and we were offered seats on the patio (overlooking the strip) or inside. It was very hot but we chose outside which was shaded which kept it cool. The waiter was quick to our table to introduce himself and take our drinks order whilst we looked at the menu. The prices are very good value and the portions are huge. There is a very good choice on the menu. I will return when next in Vegas
Enjoyed good drinks and small plates during the restaurant's happy hour.  Recommend the sangria and margarita; the pork dim sum and vegetarian lettuce wraps.  Excellent service provided by Frankie-- ask for him.
"We visited PF Changs as a group of six during our family trip to Vegas. All of the food we ordered was amazing! We ordered some appetizers to share and they were all delicious, I would definitely recommend the dry ribs and the chicken lettuce wraps. Then we moved onto our mains which again were all delicious. The peppered steak was my favourite dish. We then ordered dessert, including the chocolate cake which is HUGE! We had a fabulous night at PF Changs with good food and outstanding service from our server Ricky. Would definitely recommend!"
"Been to our 4th P.F. Chang's. Like the others, food was excellent. Staff were very accommodating. Service excellent. Good choice of drinks & cocktails. Only downfall is that seeing as we are from the UK we can't get on their website to leave any feedback."
"We've eaten at a number of PF Changs and the quality can be a bit hit or miss. This was definitely the worst so far.
When the server brought the wine glass and side plates they were obviously dirty with quite large pieces of food stuck to them, then the dishes with the food on them had dried on food too.
The server who delivered the food (different to our allocated server) knocked the side dish of super hot chilli sauce all over one of the dishes and couldn't understand why this would be a problem. The manager eventually offered to remake the dish but neither informed the original server before they came to ask if everything was OK.
When the original server delivered the check he told us that fortunately the manager had removed the problem dish from the bill, when what they had actually done was remove the remade dish from the bill so we were charged the full amount for the two dishes we ordered. When we mentioned this he just walked away."
I have to be honest the whole experience was far from 5* experience.had the crab wontons. Give those a big fat zero for flavor and less for presentation.I had the shichaun beef and my husband had the cashew chicken..both arrived lukewarm.cashew chicken was more of a chicken teriyaki..no presentation.would not return.
"This place is great.  The food, the staff and the best happy hour prices on food and drinks during the week. Check it out!"
"I love PF Chang's in Planet Hollywood. Delicious food. Fast service. Large portions. 
I ordered online, because my husband wasn't feeling well. The food was ready for pick up within 15 min."
"Whenever we return to Vegas, this the the one and only restaurant we always visit... And once again we weren't disappointed. Service was excellent and the food outstanding. I had shrimp dim sum for starters followed by schezwan chicken. My husband had spring rolls and the schezwan beef. We also had a side of garlic noodles. It was amazing food, the kind that even when you're full, you can't stop eating. Will continue to return- happy days."
"Its not often I will write a review and I will focus on the service but I was pleasantly surprised by our recent visit to P.F. Chang's.

My wife had eaten in P.F.C before in Baltimore during a recent work trip to the US so she was keen to take me to one for me to try it.

Bearing in mind P.F.C is a 'chain', the food was fab.  Really good, excellent value.  Cant fault the food at all.

However, special praise for our waiter.  Its not often someone will bend over backwards for you but this man did.  I regret not being able to remember his name now but he truly was excellent.  My wife requested an Aperol Spritz to start.  He'd never heard of it before.  So went off to investigate.  He came back to say they didnt have it but they'd make sure they'd get some in for future.  20 minutes later, he came back to tell us he'd managed to get a bottle off another bar in the hotel, so all was not lost.  He also stopped us from over-ordering on the food front.  We ordered two main dishes to share and he quickly reminded us that both came with vegetables so no need to order anything else.  If it wasnt for him, we would have spent a fortune.  He even threw in a complimentary desert, even though we said we didnt want any.  He certainly earned his extra big tip that night.

Would definitely recommend this restaurant, as long as all the waiters worked as hard as the one we had that night.  Keep up the good work my friend."
"Even though had reservation and restaurant was not full, was seated at a small, tight corner table by cashier.  Asked for and got one of many available booths.  Orange peel chicken had some undercooked fatty chunks, tea was service with a pot sized tea bag in a cup, making it extra strong and bitter.  Did not get water refills or to re-new drinks.  We ate at the PF Changs in Phoenix and they were great...avoid the Planet Hollywood one."
Great martinis and wonderful  service . We don't have P.F. Change in Canada so we go there every time  we're  in the states.
Friendly service. Had a lunch special which was reasonable. Had lettuce wraps and salad. Salad was a bit greasy but quite good. the lettuce wraps very good.
"We had dinner at this restaurant and the experience was superb, first, I noted to the waiter that we were allergic to shellfish and tuna, and they were careful enough to offer us a menu suited for people with allergies, in addition, they confirmed with the chef that the items we wanted from the regular menu were safe for us to eat, the food was fantastic, we had pad thai, fried rice, mongolian beef ,orange chicken and egg rolls, everything was exquisite and the waiter even came afterwards to check on us and make sure we were doing fine with the food , definitely a great experience"
"We always eat here when in Vegas. It is good food for a decent price and you really can't beat the location. We try to get a table outside in the evening. It is fun to eat and watch the ""entertainers"" outside on the strip. Our service has always been reliable and we have never felt rushed to hurry up and eat. The fried green beans are great for something a little different. Love PF Changes on the Strip!"
"My husband & I were fortunate that we were able to be seated right away.  There were several groups that were waiting, but a table for 2 was available.  My husband had a Strawberry Ginger Marguarita -- he enjoyed it, but the price was a little high.  We started with Lettuce Wraps -- they were great.  We then shared Honey Shrimp (again amazing) and Lo Mein (not so good).  The Lo Mein was quite ""gummy"" and had an odd flavour -- we eat Lo Mein all the time, and it wasn't near as good as what we usually have.  We left most of the Lo Mein behind.  This is a great restaurant for a group as you can order and sample numerous dishes.  Great service.  But, oddly, they had no green tea -- apparently they ran out the day before ????  Glad we tried this restaurant.  However, with so many other choices, we won't likely return as, for us, it would have to be amazing."
Food was lovely. Excellent service. Didn't have to travel too far as stayed in Planet Hollywood. Nice experience overall.
"I have never been in a PF Changs I didn't like, Phoenix or Las Vegas. We took clients to the restaurant in Vegas and we all experienced the American China food cuisine and as usual it didn't let us down.  They present themselves in a very unique way which is very enlightening and the food is wonderful. A wonderful American Chain."
My wife and I went to the P.F. Chang located inside Planet Hollywood and were most pleased to find a special atmosphere that eliminated the idea of being in a casino. The food was prepared as expected and was delightful. The server was most attentive and always had our beverages full as requested.
We like to dine at PF Changs in Waikiki and gave the one in Las Vegas a try this past visit. The location on the strip is very good and the service was prompt and polite. The food is always good in Waikiki and was at this location in Vegas as well. If you like Asian cuisine in a casual setting this is the place for you!
"Ate here after my mother in laws recommendation, the waiter was knowledgeable and provided a great service. We went with his recommendations of chicken wraps, dynamite shrimp, lemon chicken and a beef/wine dish from the specials menus. All dishes were awesome and really rather tasty!"
"Ok we wanted something fairly quick and easy and though it would be a good idea to eat here.  Looked very busy so assumed it was because of the food!  Not so!

Our waiter was lovely and helpful but the food came far too quickly to be freshly made and was just a gelatinous mess on a plate (the sweet/sour chicken and honey chicken dishes).  They had no flavour and I would struggle to even call it chicken.

Avoid."
Had my wedding reception in their private room and the food and service was excellent. Green beans and lettuce wraps were the favorite appetizers
"My wife and I went here for dinner while we were in Vegas.
I read the views before going and saw some complaints about the food being cold and thought some people are complainers so my wife really wanted to go so we wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. I ordered Sichuan Beef and when it was delivered to the table the beef looked over cook and shriveled up and sure enough it was barely Luke warm. Our server was so great I didn't want to complain but being the owner of a business that serves food I wanted them to know so hopefully they could correct the problem. I told our server that I didn't want to complain but I just wanted to be informative and let them know. A little while later the shift manager came to the table, he noticed that I didn't eat much of my dinner and I explained to him that I just wanted to let them know. When our bill came our waiter told me he didn't charge us for my dinner. The good part is my wife's chicken dinner was good and was big enough for us to share. The service was EXCELLENT!"
Husband and I like sharing the meal that is for couples.  Excellent food!  Always more than we can eat.  Go early because the place fills up quickly.
"We celebrated our friends birthday at PF Chang's on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was very busy at 6:00pm but wait time was only about 15 minutes. Customer service was great during our meal and the food was delicious, as always. Prices seemed reasonable for the delicious food we got. Our waiter was so sweet he even brought a complimentary birthday dessert + candle for our birthday girl! Highly recommend!"
"First visit to PF Changs after being recommended.  It was delicious, the staff were the right level of attentive.  BBQ ribs and Chicken Satay for starters - yum .... Kung Pao Chicken and Korean BBQ for chicken for mains ... the best chinese food we've had in a while. Excellent for a chain restaurant."
"The restaurant is a PF Changs, enough said.  What's special about this one is the outside eating area and the people walking by.  There was a great elvis impersonator and listening to him perform was the highlight of the meal."
"Just make sure to mention you are on a show schedule we had the lettuce wrap, try the fresh made crab ""rangoon"" delightful...Garlic noodle cant go wrong. 
The boozy arnold palmer type drink tasty but sweet. Just make sure you make a reservation or go early it fills u quick after 7, if you are catching a show it can be tight."
"Whenever I have an opportunity, I visit P.F. Chang's. Food was as expected. Service was excellent and attentive. If you like American style Asian food, this is a good place to eat."
"It is nothing like simple Chinese food, it is so much better. We eat there whenever we go to Las Vegas, but also have this restaurant in New York. Always excellent!"
Variety of meals. Sushi is new in the menu which is good but they should include more options. Avocado lobster roll is nice.
Found the food each time here to be very nice for good prices. Personally think this is excellent value and the service was great.
we celebrated mothers day dinner @ this restaurant located @ planet Hollywood hotel and casino. ..I have beef and broccoli. ..this one is different from all the beef and broccoli I tasted before the sauce taste good. ..service is good. ..we would definitely come back here again next were in Vegas. ..highly recommended for good dinner
Went here for happy hour before our flight back to Seattle. Huge portions and great drinks specials. My daughter said this was the best chicken fried rice she's ever had and she's tried quit a few!
"Delicious food at good prices. The lettuce wraps were great! If you like Chinese/ Asian food, definitely try this place whilst in Vegas."
"great happy hour values! The food was fresh and hot, the service was excellent, and even the outdoor seating was quiet."
"Wife and I ate on May 4, and split the same meal.  Both got sick that night and for the next 12 hours. Very bad experience would not try again."
Ten of us had a family celebration dinner here and we were not disappointed.  Good menu and reasonable price- great service and a good wine list! Would definitely recommend it.
The food was excellent and the servers were outstanding. The atmosphere was nice.  It is at a great location.  The prices for the food and wine was very good.
We have ate in PF Chang's a few times now and we are never disappointed.  Great value for the amount of food that you get.
"I make a point of always stopping in to a P.F, Chang's whenever I am in the U.S.  On this trip we went twice - once for afternoon snacks and a second visit for dinner. I'm a big fan of the pork dumplings (pan fried) and the tempura green beans. Good value so you get great food at a reasonable price."
"Mom loves PF Chang lettuce wraps.  We were in Vegas for 4 days and ate here 3 times!  Dinner one day and happy hour 2 other days.  Lettuce wraps every time!  Waiter was good for recommendations on happy hour items.  We had the orange chicken for dinner and very good.  If it's warm and sunny, enjoyed one time in outdoor seating as well."
"The crazy circus of people and beggars along this active part of the strip is overwhelming. This place offered a welcome and delicious respite. They seated us immediately, with the stroller at the table, and brought the food fast. The server was friendly, prompt and went out of his way to check in on us. The food came almost immediately and it was excellent. Vegetarian lettuce wraps were savory, full of crunch and flavor. Hubs had fiery wontons and loved them. Our son slept through dinner, but we served our daughter penne on their plates and they didn't mind. There is a hum of conversation in the restaurant, it is not a quiet place, but it felt good to be there. Lowered lighting, cheerful staff, great food. And, after I wedged the takeout container in the minibar overnight, the leftovers made the best breakfast I've had here. Did not disappoint!"
"I've been to a lot of P.F. Chang's locations, but this is the BEST! I've been there twice and the food is always super fresh."
"This was my and my wife's first Tim eating at PF Chang's. Amazing! Having never eaten there  so  we relied on the waiter who was so professional and knowledgeable. My wife had a chicken dish that was delishes and I had the ginger sea bass which was out of this world. We each had a house salad , we should have shared as it was large. For desert the waiter suggested the 7 layer chocolate cake. Bring an army to eat it. It was so good and so large. We each had a slice and there was still five layers left. Absolutely satisfied our chocolate fix. One of the best restaurants and food with great service we have ever been to. Being in Planet Hollywood was Fantastic. The cost of the meal was reasonable because of the atmosphere, service and quality. If you get the chance do not pass it up ."
Love this place had the set the meal for two . Fantastic value for money and great service and the most amazing icecream . If your in Vegas visit this place
Wanted something quick and simple and had the short soup at the bar. The broth and dumplings were very tasty and hit the spot.
"Had a front row seat to the walking circus that goes by all day and all night on Las Vegas Boulevard. The waiters were extremely polite and helpful and went out of their way to make our meal most pleasant. The food was very good and served piping hot and rapidly. The wine however was nothing to write home about. It was a real bad Sauvignon and should be removed from the offering. We were sad to hear that our initial waiter had a mishap and seriously hurt his back. We wish him all the best in his recuperation. His replacement was a very polite, genuine, helpful young man. All in all, the wine being the exception, PF Changs is a pleasant visit for a meal on the Strip"
Love going to P.F. Changs. Everyone is so friendly and service is fast. Food variety is great and is always fantastic.
With so much choice in Vegas it so hard to decide on where to eat but we are so pleased that we managed to fit P F Changs in. The front staff where welcoming and our waiter (I believe his name was Ricky) was fabulous which does make a big difference to any dining experience. The food was delicious and arrived in perfect time between courses and was just enough. We was also fortunate enough to sit upstairs at the front looking out over the strip. If you love Chinese food you will not be disappointed.
"This place is great. We went here as it was right in our hotel and close to the Axis theatre, which is where we were going directly after to see Britney Spears. Our server was wonderful and so friendly, also very attentive and very conscious of the time as we were kind of in a rush for our show! 

The food and drinks were delicious. The atmosphere was swanky and pretty romantic. Totally wish this place was in Canada!!"
"Always a great meal! This has become a must stop for us during each trip. The Mongolian beef, Changs spicy chicken, and lettuce wraps are ordered everytime."
"Came in with 15 people and almost dreading the enevitable noisy chaos of family style Asian food in a popular fusion restaurant in Las Vegas... But they EXCEEDED expectations across the board. 

They sat us in a gorgeous private room for 20 people and promptly attended to our chaotic group needs with immediate drink orders, and with great detail, I might add. That followed up with a perfectly timed food service. It was as if they knew we were hungry. We ordered lettuce wrap, edemame, crispy green beans, and calimari for appetizers. Everything here was great. This was followed up multiple portions of Mongolian beef, honey chicken, salt and pepper shrimp, Buddha feast, padthai, and white/brown rice. The hits were the shrimp and beef. 

To cap it off they didn't add service to to bill so I generously tipped the hard working waiter. 

Got a big group and was Asian food? Go here!"
"First impression: seemed like a very nice place. Décor was nice enough. The restaurant is right off the casino floor in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. 
We were given a table in the upstairs portion of the place. While walking thru the floor seemed slippery to my wife and I. That's not the 1st place in Vegas we experienced the slippery floor phenomenon. Weird, especially for a restaurant.
We didn't get menus from the hostess, our server brought them. Mine was slightly sticky, yum! The server was very nice. Answered all our questions and was very patient with us. When my wife had a question about ingredients in a particular dish he went to check in the kitchen and returned promptly with the info.
The food itself was pretty bad. We ordered the assorted steamed dumplings for an appetizer to share. They were actually cold inside, as if they came out of the refrigerator. When informed, our server was very apologetic and quickly brought us another serving. They were lukewarm, but we ate them anyway. Our dinners weren't much better. Mine was warm at best, my wife's was barely warm not hot as if they came right from the stove/wok.  We didn't say anything further to the server, as it was obvious we weren't going to get hot food that  night. I guess their microwaves were not working properly that evening.
The server did comp our cold/lukewarm appetizer.
Not a place we would visit again when we return to Vegas."
"Arrived for a late night dinner after a show. Was seated right away. Waiter pleasant and friendly. Ordered Satay chicken, Singapore noodles and Honey chicken. While eating our appetizer (chicken satay) hair was found in my plate which was a total turnoff. Waiter apologized and repeated that the dish was removed from the bill as if that was a ""favor"" to us....I would have insisted to remove it either way because we didn't even consume much of it before the hair was found. He also said he informed the manager who didn't even have the decency to come over to our table to address the issue and apologize. Being a chain I have frequented this restaurant in my hometown and have never encountered any issues with the food let alone a sanitary issue. I rated it average because of the overall food chains quality but this particular location was not good. Would definitely not return to this location."
"Every time I go here, never disappointed. I would recommend reservations as they are always busy. Wide variety on the menu. Something for everyone"
"The restaurant interior is really nice, but we set outside for the sun. Food was ok, not too impressive but tasty. Our waiter was wonderful, so he made our experience much much better then it was."
"Don't miss the combo lunch plates at PF Chang's if you are at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. We started our lunch with an order of fried green beans and Dan Dan Noodles.I ordered the beef and broccoli on the combo lunch menu and ordered a crispy salad on the side. I LOVED the salad. First time I ever ordered one. The fried rice was excellent. 
It was way too much food to split with 4 adults. When I go back I am simply getting the fried green beans and the crispy salad."
"Consistent with all PF Chang's, so very good.
Was able to get order to go, and continue to play at my slot machine."
"We love PF Chang's and are regular clients in Guadalajara, Mexico. We love the asiatic mix of dishes they have in the menu.
As soon as we saw the restaurant, we went there to have dinner and experience it in a different country.The food was quite dissapointing, tasteless, the soup was almost solid, the best was lettuce wraps, delicious. Coffe was bad and cold, the cream was literally freezed... we felt everything was hit & miss.
Service is outstanding, that's the reason I am rating 4 stars, otherwise, I'd rate the restaurant as a 3 tops"
"We enjoyed our lunch on the patio so much one day, that we returned the next evening for dinner inside and upstairs with a good view of the strip below.

The menu is fairly extensive as is the price range. You can go small plate or all out big meal. The lemongrass chicken salad was amazing & I didn't even come close to finishing it. We also loved the tasty crab wontons.

I imagine on weekends this place fills up fast - going mid-week we had no waits at either visit. Service was fast. Definitely add this one to your saved list."
"We just visited Vegas again for another week, and couldn't wait to get back to P F Changs! We were going to try a different one, but due to its location and easy accessibility we went back to this one at planet hollywood! The best food we ate all week for sure!

I ate the chicken Pad Thai which i to die for, and my wife had the Red Wine beef special which was just as good if not better!!

We can't wait to come back!!"
"My friend and I shared a plate of rice and Sweet & Sour Chicken.  It was delicious!  Really good food, and a nice quiet dining atmosphere.  Would recommend to others!"
"We all love Chinese and this was excellent. We picked a mix of dishes and each was super. Ask for an upstairs table and enjoy excellent views of the strip by night. Very reasonable, loved it!"
We have eaten at a few PF Chang's and have always enjoyed the food. It's always very flavorsome and a good way to get veggies in during a holiday.
"We sat outside which was nice and had  good service and good food. I thought the Mongolian beef was a bit chewy but the other dishes were good. Our server was excellent and he apologized when our main course arrived within a minute or two of our appetizer. I am not sure if Chang`s does this on purpose to get people in and out quickly.
I think P.F. Chang`s is good if you want to sit down with a glass of wine and eat Asian food. Maybe order your main dishes after you have enjoyed your appetizer 
A good place,however, in my opinion, Panda Express is less money and just as good if fast food suites your fancy."
we went here late night after a show one day (it was 1130 and their kitchen closed at 12) . and our food was INCREDIBLE . my boyfriend had the mongolian beef and i had the pepper steak and it was awesome ! they are a little pricy as expected but it was well worth it !
"We dined here on the first night of our trip to Vegas. After a long haul flight from the UK we just wanted somewhere that didn't need an advanced reservation and wasn't too far from where we were staying at the Bellagio, and also had good food. I had read previous reviews on here, so decided this would be the place to go.
Service was quick and friendly, even making suggestions for our meal choices. Had a nice Japanese beer as well. 
Reasonable prices and one to recommend."
"We had the dinner for two option which is a good deal if you want all the food (turned out to be too much for us).

Hot and sour soup was tasty but a little too thick.  Same for the egg drop soup which was tasty but a touch too salty.

Crispy green beans are excellent and the portion is huge for an appetizer.

Mongolian beef is excellent and the best of the two entree's.  The honey chicken was tasty but very sweet and the chicken did not have the best texture.

Desert, fried banana, was good and nicely shared.

The staff are excellent.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, highlight of the meal."
"Ate at PF Change's in the Planet Hollywood Resort. Delicious food and very nice and fast service. Wait times are small from 5-10 minutes. Our servers was friendly and fast. Atmosphere is very nice. If weather permits, sit outside and enjoy the people walking on The Strip while you eat."
"Great for all....couples, families, celebrations. The service was very attentive and the meals came quickly (as expected with this cuisine)."
"We visited twice on our trip there. The lettuce wraps are very, very good! We had the chicken ones but there is a Vegan selection also. The Singapore street noodles were very tasty and one of the best I've tasted so far! Second time we had shaking beef and it was awesome! I had the cup of wonton soup but found it too expensive for what I got so I wouldn't order it again. The happy hour is at the bar from 3-7 half price appetizers! They offered it in the restaurant years ago...but things change! Anyway it is with eating there if you get sick of buffets!"
Took my family for lunch  and  I was very pleased with their service and food....will definitely go back!
"P F Chang's is one of our favorite restaurants in any city, and we try to visit every one we see. We are never disappointed. During this visit, we had the Hot Sour Soup----delicious, and the large bowl is LARGE!"
"Have to admit this is the first time I ever experienced a PF Changs/ As a traditionist Chinese food lover, I did not think I would be able to find a typcal Chinese dish on the menu. I did in fact. I had the Lo Mein with Chicken. The other groups in our party had the more exotic chinese dishes,whch they said were excellent. The service was just OK, but a lot has to do with the multitude of diners that were present. We were seated at a corner table outside with most likely had to do with the lack of 5 star service. My food was prepared good. It could of been a lot hotter but then the restaurant was mobbed with customers. Chose a time to visit this restaurant when the crowds are at the minimum. (If that's possible) Other than the aabove it was a pleasant experience. Something I will go to again. Nit in Vegas, but elsewhere. They are all over the country."
"This place knows how to take care of customers.  Yes, you will have to wait.  But the bar service is great, the food quality is great, the food portions are great - and you don't feel like you are at a chain restaurant.  This is a wonderful choice on the strip.  Quality all around.  It is a lively atmosphere (noisy) but that's ok.  The service and food make up for it.  Enjoy it and have a great time at this restaurant."
"On my most recent trip to Vegas, this was my favorite meal. The restaurant was very nice - clean, nicely decorated, and despite being inside Planet Hollywood it was relatively quiet. Our 2 servers were fantastic at making sure we had everything we need. Food was quick and delicious. We had hot and sour soup, Chang's spicy chicken, Kung Pao scallops and a vegetable dish.

If you like Asian cuisine this is some of best you can find."
"The night we went it was insanely busy and despite having a reservation, we waited 15 minutes to get a table. We sat on the patio because it was quicker to get a table out there. The servers seemed overwhelmed and forgot part of our order. He quickly rectified it when he noticed and apologized. We will still go back next time because the food is good and a great value for Vegas."
"The wife fancied a Chinese, so, after checking out a few menus, we decided on this place and were not disappointed. 

Photos of the food are attached and they don't do the delicious tastes justice.

Great service too, so all in all, just a terrific place to go.

Try not to sit near the doors onto the terrace on a windy night though, it can get a little chilly!!!

Now I want to know if there's a P F Chang in London!!"
"Okay so I'm dairy and gluten intolerant, which makes my life miserable whenever I go out for dinner. PF Chang is one of the very few resto chains that I trust with my digestive system. They bend-over backwards to make sure everything is safe and not contaminated. We ate at the terrace outside, gave us the chance to enjoy the strip while eating delicious food. Excellent service made our two dinners (yes, we like it that much) a memorable event!"
"Staff was very nice, dinner was good. The waiter was very nice and checked on us. never a dry glass at the table.. outside of the dressing on the side and not on the salad it was ver nice dinner with family"
"PF Changs is always good food, this one is no different.  It is a chain though.  We ate here out of necessity one night.  We were not disappointed, food was great. But in Vegas there are so many other options.  This location is great, it really is a nice place. If you are staying in Planet Hollywood this is a nice option to have.  But get there early, it goes on a wait fast."
Great Asian flavours with great service. Convinently located at Planet Hollywood. Great choice to visit with family and friends
"We had a server who was very genuine about his service.  He spoke like he would speak to anyone.  ""I've got you man"" and things like that.  If you're looking for an informal dining experience, sit out on their patio, enjoy the sights and some great, affordable Asian Cuisine.

We had the Lettuce Wraps and Mongolian Beef and were VERY happy with the food.  This is a great restaurant for a group to order several dishes and share plates!  Will be back next time I'm in LV."
"March of 2016. I'll start from saying that this was my third trip to P.F Chang overall and it was successful, just Iike two others at different locations. I went here for a dinner with friends. We asked to sit outside. Weather was a bit cold so they turned heater for us. Servant was a young guy, polite and good at what he is doing. I ordered Won Ton soup and it was very tasty and overall better than at other two locations that I've been to. Also, I got Mongolian beef because it was their most popular dish. Honestly, it' was nothing fancy. They brought beef on a separate plate form the side, mixed with lots of green onions. Excess of green onions kinda ruined taste of beef, but its alright I'm not going to be really picky about it. Overall, I enjoyed time spent here. Comfort is 5 out 5, Food 4 out 5, I feel like this restaurant overpriced so price 3 out 5."
"We order a few appetizers, fired rice and one entrée to share, We had water to drink and the bill was over $70.00 which is crazy. We have eaten at many PF Changs and this was the worst one ever. I wouldn't return to this location but maybe somewhere else."
I love their lettuce wraps so we went two days in a row for Happy Hour when they are cheaper and so are the drinks. But I think we had to sit at the bar for a happy hour deal? Not sure cannot remember for sure. The hostess and waiter/waitresses are always friendly to us and give good service. Every time we visit Vegas we make sure to stop by at least once. We will be back in June and definitely plan to visit.
I don't really like to post negative reviews unless there is a very good reason. This is a good reason. Six of us ate there on 3/6. My wife and I shared Orange Chicken and the Shrimp and noodles. We both got sick latter that evening. We were not drinking so that's not why we got sick. Another person in our group had a beef dish and spent the next 12 hours in the bathroom. If you eat there your taking a chance. 50-50. Better odds you will get sick than and slots in town.
Stopped in for an early meal before hitting the strip. They had great deals on appetizers and deer. Excellent choice for good food at reasonable price.
"We visited in 2011. The lettuce wraps here are addictive !!! I had never had a lettuce wrap until I had one at P.F Chang's in Vegas and I've been hooked . The other food we had was very good but the lettuce wraps are by far my favourite, Enjoy :)"
"Another nice place for some normal dinner, instead of all the trappings of Vegas. The lettuce wraps always great, for an appetizer.The service was good , the food was great."
"We sat at the bar and ordered lettuce wraps and some chicken stuff and it was delicious! Food came out fast and the drinks were cold. Our bar tender was very nice, I recommend going."
"Great food
Great Service.

Made reservations. was quick. Everything was set up. 
Waiter was great. 

all i can ask for"
"Good food and service ! Big varieties of food in a Chinese style ! Good taste I ordered a gluten free and it's came perfect ! Of course the dishes with gluten are more tasteful ! Good ambient and music ! Good for a happy hour , couple and group"
"Noon on Friday ,  cold coffee , dear lord don't want to be watching calories. God forbid you ask for 25 cents of lettuce in a cup vs rice. Just won't happen need to pay $2.00 for a whole head of lettuce.   Not impressed at all. To many other places that are proud to support Las Vegas hospitality.   1 star. Waitress was nice"
"Ended up having a dinner at P. F. Chang's China Bistro located in Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. It was, once again, all very good, delicious spicy prawns with rice in a sauce and great cold beer, service was OK except for the bartender wearing those pants that expose the underwear. Otherwise all good."
Pretty standard PF Chang.....good service....nice location within Planet Hollywood.  Food and drink good as always.
"Good value for money and the food is excellent . Restaurant is always busy which shows how good it is , great location in the centre of the strip . We had a great deal of food for 3 that cost around $100 dollars , great value . Will be back"
"Didnt know where to go to eat.  We seen PF Chans and immediately decide to go there.  NEVER a bad meal. First time we caught their Happy Hour meals deals.  Prices were good and the portion were healthy as I was expecting small amounts.  However the first time I received average service or less.  I had asked what their Craft beer choice of the day was and the waiter couldnt remember so i said I'll have one.  When he returned he told me it was   ah, ah, ah, ah  mmmm   I forgot sorry sir so that would allow me to give this waiter a below average.  Previously I have nothing lower that above average.."
"I love PF Changs but I really love it in Vegas.  Plus it is so much cooler when it is in Planet Hollywood.  Great restaurant, great food, great service and it's always great to be in Vegas."
Enjoyed a nice meal with my family. Able to share dishes so it made it even more enjoyable. Never rushed and very attentive staff. Our waiter was very quick witted and gave great suggestion. Overall a great dinner for all.
I'm always a great fan of PF Changs. And this is the one place which I never miss to eat out whenever I travel across the states. Their food is always consistent and their service top notch. My all time favourites are their Dynamite Shrimp and house made ginger beer.
"Fast service, friendly staff and a great selection on the menu.
The food was hot and tasty and reasonably priced."
"Staff was great and food, well, if your at PF Chang's you all ready know!!  Good selection of beer and mixed drinks too."
"We should have gotten a reservation, but we didn't. It did not matter since it was just the two of us. We sat at the bar and ate. The service was top notch and the food was incredible. It was my first time at a PF Changs. I will definitely come back to this one next trip and will be visiting the one in the area where I live!"
Great location.  Walked in without a reservation and only had a 5 minute wait.  Service is friendly.  We ordered a family size hot and sour soup and an appetizer for 2 of us and it was perfect size.  We will definitely be back..
We decided to eat very late on Thursday around 11pm and we were expecting waitress to be rushing us but to our pleasant surprise we were treated so nicely with smile and great service. PF changs has always been a great place to eat late or not always friendly! Thank you
We had the tofu with the coconut curry sauce and the stir fry mix vegetables and tofu. We also tried the fried rice and were happy because the food was really tasty here. The servers were also very friendly and helpful!
I have asked my wife many times if she would like to eat here. The answer was always no!   Our friends invited us and reluctantly she went with us. We have been back and will continue to dine here.  Great service and food.
"I love the complex flavours of Asian food, combine that with quality cuts of meat it's amazing! Love this place"
We are always happy with the fact we can return and return to excellent service and great food.  Love the small plate addition
This location has larger portions than other Chang's I have visited. Seems like wait times are less and servers more helpful.
"Very enjoyable meal here, great service with a smile. Would recommend this eatery if in LV at Planet Hollywood."
"This is a great place to eat with a group or family. Wide variety of food options in traditional Chinese style. Moderate pricing, great service and a full bar. Ths location also has outdoor seating with a view of the strip pedestrian traffic."
"This location is crazy busy 
But always accommodates 
They have amazing staff 
Food is always fresh and hot"
"Hi and thank you for reading. Was there a week ago with 2 families with 3 kids aged 14 & 15 with a grand

Positive
- had a private room which is a boon for folks needing some peace
- excellent server 
- excellent dessert 
- good portion 
- good location 

Negative
- more inclined towards western taste despite its label hence dessert was way better than the dishes served ha ha ha
- pricey

Conclusion
- wont return due to taste and wallet damage"
"You have to dine here for the lettuce wraps, they are to die for! Went back several times on our 4 day Vacay just for the lettuce wraps. When we did order other menu items they were equally delicious."
They have amazing food and the restaurant is always so clean.  Service is always good and the food always looks so nice.
Got hungry walking the strip and landed on P.R.Chang's in Planet Hollywood. Had a good seat by the window and watch people go by in different attires and attitudes. Had a very good soup and plenty of food for very reasonable price. Our waiter even gave us tips on how we can take home our soup and have it warmed at the hotel we are staying in.
"I'm not typically a fan of eating at chain restaurants when traveling, but make an exception for the P.F. Chang's located in Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas strip.  Service is always exceptional, as is the food and atmosphere."
Always good food at  Chang's and very reasonable prices...the soup and appetizers  are fantastic   ..i love all the chicken dishes
"I know it is a chain, and we eat at one locally in Austin, but this meal was fantastic.  I had Korean bar-b-que and my wife had a spicy shrimp dinner that were just crazy good.  They serve a citrus rum drink that is very refreshing.  If you drink three of them you will need help driving home!!   :-)"
"P.F. Cheung's is Chinese and Asian themed restaurant at the Planet Hollywood Hotel that makes for a good dining venue for families and groups visiting Vegas. Restaurant environs are casual and relaxed, decor and menu are Chinese and Asian influenced with an expected range of dishes. 

During our meal, we found food to be mixed. Chang Spicy Chicken was served with sweet chili sauce which is more usually featured in Thai cuisine but that was ok, the dish tasted nice. Kung Pao Chicken, which is a Sichuan style dish, was also pretty good. Chicken coating was interesting but we enjoyed the flavours of this dish. 

The Orange Peel Beef was a bad serving. Dish was served luke-warm and with a thick sauce that tasted odd. Orange peels didn't complement the beef or heavy sauce well. This dish didn't make a lot of sense taste wise. We'd skip this one next time. 

Overall, we like the venue for family and large group dining. Dishes are Chinese and Asian inspired instead of authentic but that is ok. Plenty of safe and familiar options and food generally tastes good - if you order well."
"I remembered it was bad, didn't want to go there but my family insisted.
Atmosphere is great!   You feel like your in a Chinese restaurant or even China, service was quick, efficient and courteous.
The only problem is the food! 
Every thing is tasteless or with bad taste.  It's amazing this restaurant still makes a profit.
I have to mention the deserts especially the one with the fried banana that was amazing.
Hope they improve the food."
If your visiting Vegas I highly recommend this place. Quick and real sweet tasting food. Great location and great view from the upper deck. Lov it.
"We visited here whilst on holiday in Las Vegas, the food was very tasty and service was good. Four of us shared four dishes, these come on separate plates so this makes it easier to share would definitely recommend a visit."
"Went here for lunch just after we arrived.I often go to this chain and the food is alwaysVery good.But I have to say it was good,but not as good as I have eaten at other cities.,that have this chain"
"Service was good, the restaurant decoration is beautiful. When we get to the food part, that's when I recommend you don't go there!  A waste of calories, a waste of time and a waste of money!
How ever the restaurant gets two stars for its amazing decor and for its amazing deserts..... And the servers were super nice and super professional."
"We were staying at plant Hollywood and went here for dinner. We had the shrimp and lobster sauce,yummm. Some fried rice and veggies were more than enough. Was excellent service and apple martinis."
"We arrived into Vegas late and decided to walk over to PF Changs for dinner. My brother is quite the foodie and it took a lot of convincing to get him here. He really liked it!  We had lettuce wraps, crispy green beans and 2 other dishes. I forgot how big the servings are and we ordered too much.  If you want 4 dishes, order 3!"
PF Changs situated across the casino floor at Planet Hollywood resort and casino is the best value for money dinner you can buy. Great food great staff and the best portions ask for a table with the view of the belagio fountains by booking in advance. My vegas trip is never complete with out at least a couple of visits to PF Changs 10/10 every time
Went with a group of 10 on a Sunday early afternoon.  We were seated and the server took our drink order.  Too a bit too long for the drinks to be delivered.  Ordered food and the wait was okay.  The problem was the food when it was delivered was luke warm at best.  We all thought the same of our meals.  The service was okay.  The food over priced.
Great find on the strip.  The food was good like all of their other locations.  Excellent service.  Hal was our waiter and he was terrific.  He was super friendly and took great care of us.
We love P.F. Chang's wherever we go. There's usually a wait so reservations are recommended. The set up of the hostess area and where the wait staff brings out food is very congested. The service is usually decent but it's very loud. Sometimes hard to have a converation.
First time eating here wasn't sure what to expect from a Chinese chain restaurant but I was very impressed! Staff was very helpful and the food was very well priced. Will return every time I'm in Vegas
"There was once a time when you could get a good mean really cheaply on the strip.  No more.  This restaurant is a very good value in my opinion.  As I was traveling alone I chose to hit their happy hour and sit at the bar.  I made a great meal out of three appetizers and two glasses of decent cabernet.  All for less than I would have paid for a mediocre meal most at any other strip restaurant.  The food was up to Chang's usual high quality and my bartender was friendly and attentive.  So especially for those traveling alone, grab a seat at the bar and have a no hassle, delicious meal."
"The food here is of excellent value, we were sat at a table overlooking the strip and it really added to our experience. Our waitress was excellent - really wish i got her name! She was so friendly and always checking on us. 
There are more fine-dining Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas but this one was great for having at the end of a busy day on the Strip."
"This place is a staple when we come to Las Vegas.  Always the best and friendly service form the wait staff.  We actually ate here on two seperate occasions this time.
The food always comes out fast and hot.  NO need to change anything with this place.  I just wish they would open one up in Green Bay, WI."
"Do not go to dinner here before having to wear a tight dress or big night out. Food is typical chain Chinese. Super tasty, fried,fatty and salty. So tasty though!! My fingers swelled up from all the salt. Service was prompt and friendly."
"I knew of this restaurant only by name, but it was a pleasure to visit.  The decor is Asian Modern, if a tad dark, but comfortable.

It's always a treat for me to enjoy Tsingtao beer with my Asian food, and Chang's had it available. The menu was pretty varied, including lighter fare and gluten-free options for those who are interested.

I chose the Orange Beef entree and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Price was surprisingly reasonable for the entree and my beer, which is no small achievement given the Vegas locale."
"My husband and I always visit P F Chang when we visit the USA, and we were not disappointed when we recently visited Las Vegas. 

We ate here on two separate occasions. On the first visit we sat at a table and the second we sat at the bar. On both occasions the service was quick, friendly and the food was fantastic value for money. 

Unless you were looking for it, you could easily walk straight past, but it is well worth heading to Planet Hollywood and enjoying good, affordable food and drinks. We highly recommend this restaurant."
"My wife and I had a very nice evening in PF Changs during CES 2016 it being almost exactly a year since our previous and first visit to this restaurant. We had a reservation for 7pm and were seated at a nice double table downstairs. Our server was great and we enjoyed a mix of dumplings and sushi and a couple of cocktails. The food was great, as was the service and atmosphere. This was our second visit to their Planet Hollywood branch and would recommend it if Asian food appeals to you."
"We went to P.F. Chang's in Las Vegas after seeing the Bellagio Fountains.  It was the first time two of our friends had eaten at a P.F. Chang's restaurant.  Started with traditional chicken lettuce wraps.  Followed by pork lo mein, honey shrimp, spicy chicken, and honey chicken.  Prompt service and great quality food.  We enjoyed the view on the second floor overlooking Las Vegas Boulevard.  Highly recommend."
Always a must whenever we travel. Staff is always great. Food never disappoints. Drinks are yummy. great location and atmosphere.
"great place for Chinese food. there is usually a wait of about 20-30 minutes but is definitely worth it. we always start off with the lettuce wraps. the rest of the food is standard Asian food but done very well. prices are very reasonable. decor is very nice and atmosphere is good, a little on the loud side but not too bad"
"Four of us shared Dynomite shrimp, lettuce wraps, pork fried rice and honey chicken. Everything was good and we ate every bit of it!"
"We love PF Chang's and it's not in my home town, so we always stop in when we see one.  Usually very crowded no matter what time you go.  We sometimes eat at the bar so save time waiting."
"Although the food is good, the atmosphere is lacking. I found it to be crowded and very noisy. I recommend the lettuce wraps and the honey chicken. Be prepared to wait if you get there at the dinner hour."
"We were at the Bellagio just to hang out, but we went across the street to PF Chang’s for dinner.  In large part the decision was due to how clearly PF Chang’s menu is geared to be Gluten-Free-Friendly.  For instance, although very little traditional East-Asian cooking depends on wheat, very few East-Asian restaurants will commit to having Gluten free rice, soy sauce, breading, etc.  In this regard we were extremely pleased with PF Chang’s.  Their rice is GMO and Gluten-Free and sustainably sourced.  Also their ginger beer is fantastic.  They were busy, but we were seated and served very quickly.  Everything was fantastic.  I don’t think we had another choice available that would have been anywhere near as good."
This was a great change for us from the food in the hotels that is over priced.  Service and food were both very good.  We were not rushed and had a very pleasant evening.
"First time visiting a P.F Changs.  Food and service was good  Enjoyed the honey chicken and white rice.  Even though the restaurant was very busy, service was good and fast"
This is hands down our favorite Chinese restaurant. We visit them in every city we go too. We ended up doing take out at this location and there was one problem. I ordered a kids lomein like I normally do because I like it as a side instead of rice. It cost $5 and normally it's a pretty good portion. Well when we got back to our hotel I realized that they gave me about a measuring cup worth of noodles and they were plain as in no sauce. If someone from the restaurant reads this then please make sure you're doing better quality control. We are still going to go back there in the future. We just hope that we have a  better experience.
"I absolutely love this place. They are always consistent and this location is no different. Drinks were amazing, service was awesome. The food, on the food was yummy! If you love PF changs it is worth the 45 min wait. Grab an Asian Pear Mojito and the pager and go play slots or poker until your beeper goes off."
"Food was good but expensive.  Had Orange Ginger  Steamed Edamame $7.98.  My daughter-in-law had the Mongolian Beef Sweet, soy-glazed 12oz sliced flank steak seared with scallions and garlic $18.95 and I had the Sesame Chicken in sesame sauce with broccoli, red bell peppers and onion $16.50.  I had a cup of regular  coffee that was served luke warm and so had them replace it and I was never offered another cup $2.95.  Service was minimal and total bill for 2 people was $50.00.  Tip was extra."
I love this restaurant and especially the Chilean Sea Bass... You will not be disappointed... Sit back; enjoy a sampling of SAKE' and lose yourself in the flaky delicious Chilean Sea Bass over a bed of Spinach.
"Dont know how anyone can come on here and talk down this place. Was recommended this by a friend and ended up  going 2 nights out of 7. The BBQ ribs for starters were amazing both nights, never mind the spicy chicken and also the Mongolian Beef.

Wow place is unreal from the food to the friendliest staff you could wish for. 

Thanks folks."
"I visited this place with my wife when we were enjoying the strip. The front door lady taken us on the second floor near glass so we can get a really good view of strip. This is very close the musical fountains of Ballagio Casio. We got a really good view of the fountain while having our dinner. 

The service was really quick and best.  Our lemonade was refilled even before we thought to ask for it :)

The food was good as any pf chang place but was less oily. 
If you are on strip and want to enjoy pf chang, must visit for service and good food."
"The food was good, but not great. The pricing was fairly reasonable. The restaurant itself was very nicely decorated and was in a good location. The staff were very friendly and attentive."
The wait was not nearly as long as estimated. Food was perfect and the service was great. The gave a party a nice private seating area and took good care of us.
"Everything from the service to the food was just okay. The food was fine but considering how many restaurants are in Vegas, next time I will definitely try something else. This was definitely not a memorable meal."
"At this restaurant inside The Planet Hollywood, a person can make reservations in advance. The tables and booths are clean and have lots of room. We ate upstairs where we could see the Strip. The food was well prepared and delicious. I highly recommend the chicken wraps, coconut shrimp, and Kung pao chicken. Their Mojito's are xlnt too. And their entire staff are polite, prompt, well informed, helpful, efficient. I recommend eating here."
"My first time trying the legendary PF Changs in Planet Hollywood was not disappointing. They offer Happy Hour at the bar for bevvies and snacks, which made a solo visit very affordable. Since the plates were appy size, I was able to sample more than I normally would and absolutely LOVED the dumplings! Food was $6 - $8 plate and expect to order 2 or 3 for a meal. And the service was excellent."
"Took a long Time to Give a Table to Us ,We Seat at the Bar Waiting for the Table.We get the Table and the Server Offer some Wraps for Appetizer we Decline and the Service When to Hell, so we order Salmon Grill was horrible , small portion 32.dollars I order Combination lo Main 24 dollars  the drinks was strong ,12 each. was busy Inside of Planet Hollywood Hotel but Facing the Strip Anyway . THE SERVICE WAS BAD . We Never Coming Back"
"Went here prior to a show thinking it would be like other P.F. Changs I have visited.  I was wrong.  Dry crunchy rice.  Cloudy Iced tea. Over crowded, over priced.  Should have went to Pei-Wei.  Hostess was GREAT!  Said it would be 20 minute wait and told me the Jets just won and she cheered did a little jig with a great smile!!  I agreed with her excitement.  10 minutes latter I was sitting down window seat strip view.  I have to remember this was Christmas weekend and it was crowded.  This could be the reason of the less than fantastic food they normally have.  But that's not an excuse.  They should have been prepared.  Will I go back?  Sure, But not on a holiday weekend or weekend."
"Stopped by during our walk on The Strip.  The place was busy but we were seated almost immediately in a booth. The booth was comfortable and spacious.
Drinks prices were good overall.  The menu offered lots of choices and it was difficult to know what to choose.
I ordered the Singapore noodles with extra chillis. I could have handled it with more spice but it was still very tasty.
Service was good"
The food was great and typical for this restaurant chain.  Our family as usual is very satisfied with the meal and for the price they offer it for.  Well worth getting reservations and worth the price.
"For the best in Asian inspired cuisine this is always a good choice.  I have never been disappointed with my visits to PFC's at PH. I always leave with leftovers, and enjoy the food and  flavors the next day. After eating you are close to gaming at PH Casino and shopping in the Miracle Mile Shops."
nice and clean compare to many that i went to and my #1 fav is in la Hoya in San Diego.  Since they are busy and the foods always fresh cook.
"Visited with family and each of our party ordered something different so we could share. Service was prompt and efficient.  Food was reasonably priced at about $15-20 USD per dish.  Everyone was happy with their choices and left more than satisfied.  
Check the bill, a couple of items were added to our bill by mistake, prompty recified by staff."
"The visit started off great! The green bean appetizer was outstanding.  Then strangeness began to manifest itself.  The waitress dropped the hot sauce, and inexplicably the sauce bounced up and hit my husband in the eye. The manager came out with some eye drops; so apparently this happens frequently.  Anyway he said the meal was on the house, gave us his card, and said they had full insurance.  He even checked up on his before we left.  By the way, the food was outstanding."
"On a busy night, they will rush you through dinner and will bring out dishes staggered.  While we waited for our table of 4 to get all 4 plates before starting to eat,the first dishes got cold.  We felt very hurried through the meal, as they were trying to turn over tables fast.  Food was mediocre for a PF Changs - I've been to others that were much better."
"We ordered the Prix Fixe dinner for two.  Website price in Vegas says it is $42.95 but menu at restaurant it was $49.95  Wow a 18% increase in price!  I just double checked and see that the price on line is $49.95 at the Las Vegas venue on the Strip at Planet Hollywood.  In any case, this and the rest of the menu seem overpriced for what you get.   Two small bowls (cup) of soup, one appetizer to share, two entrees from a limited list and a joke as a desert, two wantons or one each.  Yikes! Now I better understand now my wife's reaction when we walked in as she said ""are you sure it is open, there is no one here!""  Pretty clear that high prices and average food will send customers somewhere else, particularly at this location where there must be at least 10 casual eateries in the Mall by the Planet Hollywood.  We do not see a reason to come back."
I must say the food was delicious. I had the sweet and sour chicken and the lettuce wraps. The service was awesome and we didn't have to wait to be seated. The only issue I had was that the nearest bathroom was located in the casino. Just seemed odd to have to walk out to the casino to use the bathroom.
"Within walking distance of our Hotel (Paris Casino), Chang's is in the heart of the Strip.  The best part was our meal . . . which was copious and hearty.  Our service and waiter were both excellent."
"If you've ever been to a P.F. Chang's at home, expect the same fare in Vegas.  This is a nice place for people watching if you choose to sit on the patio.  We enjoyed drinks and appetizers while taking a break in our afternoon.  The only drawback we found was that they don't offer samples of beer.  This was the first place of this caliber that we found this missing.  Otherwise, very good.  Great service."
I took my mother here last night. This was one of her favorite restaurant on the strip. We had lettuce raps and a rice dish. Service was good but the food was soso. My tea was very old tasting and the presentation was poor
"Great Food, Great Service! Had such great service and food the first visit we went again later in the trip. Helpful input on choosing menu items, fast service with appetizers  and drinks. We received a complimentary rib appetizer just because which was fantastic. Can't say enough I wish we had a PF Changs in Victoria BC."
"The wait to be seated was more than 25 minutes. However, the food at P.F. Chang's is good, pricey but, I promise you your taste buds will not complain."
The restaurant is located inside the Planet Hollywood.   Price is mid ranged and good.  Place is always crowded.   The ambiance is not really good may be because is not a big place.
"Ok so i am comparing this P.F Changs with the one in orlando, the one in orlando was really good we enjoyed it and was very tastefully done.

Now the one in Las Vegas Planet Hollywood is the one i am reviewing was not as good and quite poor in comparison, didn't like the atmosphere, the food wasn't as good, it all had the same type of lime flavouring to it, but the service was good, I definitely wouldn't visit this one again."
The food here is always pretty good. the staff is nice. i always get the same dish but have never heard a bad review on any of the popular dishes.
Not your typical Chinese restaurant P.F. Chang's at the Planet Hollywood offers Chinese food with a twist and flair. The dishes are wonderfully presented and always tasty. The restaurant is a bit crowded and if you have a table mid restaurant you will likely get bumped into by customers passing you by. Better ask to be sat at a booth if one is available.
We have eaten here at least twice on each of the 5 visits we've had to Las Vegas and it gets better every time. The service is always excellent and the alcohol measures are plenty. I would recommend trying my personal favourites of crispy green beans for starters and Mongolian beef for mains. Go easy when ordering extra rice as the mains come with a bowl of free rice so there is plenty for between 2-3 people. The noodles and the special fried rice are a must as they are both superb but agin be aware that they are large portions. All in all an excellent restaurant that you could never tire of visiting.
I took my family for a launch and it was okay. Service was and the food was just okay. I think PF Chang LA locations apre way better .
"We stopped by this restaurant because they had a nice variety on their menu ( gluten free, vegetarian)
We ordered their vegetarian lettuce wrap. Tasty and spicy!
The eggplant was delicious as their budda feast steamed , and the light coconut curry vegetable with brown rice. We were all satisfied with their dishes.
Service was good too."
We went to PF Chang's for the first time and had an excellent experience. Our server was efficient and pleasant. We had the Singapore Noodles and Sesame Chicken and both were one of our best meals at a Chinese restaurant.
This experience changed my opinion of PF Chang's. I really liked my crab wontons and my companions were very happy with their almond chicken and sesame chicken. The waiter was great and funny.
"This is the second time I have been to a PFChang's.  The fist time was in Tempe, Az and I got sick on the lobster sauce.  I gave it another try in Vegas and ordered the satay.  It arrived and I sliced into the first piece of chicken - raw.  Same with the second and third.  Of course I complained and the manager couldn't have been nicer but the meal was ruined for me.  Who knows how the rest of the food is prepared?  He did comp my friends meal but it really turned me off to think that they served raw chicken.  Once getting sick, maybe but twice, something
 is wrong with the qualifications of the cooks they hire and how they are trained. NEVER AGAIN.  Once maybe, twice, no."
Large asian eatery inside planet hollywood that serves modern asian food. Mongolian beef and beef bugogi were particularly good. The hot and sour soup was served in a bowl that easily fed 4.
"Went with a group of 5 friends. Food is served family style, so we all got to try a little of everything. Opted for quinoa instead of rice, and it was cooked perfectly. The restaurant is lively and quite dimly lit. If you went with a large crowd, there couldn't be a whole lot of conversation between the two ends of the table. 
My only complaint is that the food wasn't as hot as it could have been. Still tasted delicious though!"
Ate here with three other friends before the Brittany spear concert. Concept of sharing sides with rice or noodles. Decent food quality and nice service. I liked the atmosphere.
"We had the dinner for two, with a choice of soups, appetizer ,entree's  and a dessert. Service was great and the food was fresh with a well seasoned chef. We both enjoyed our meal but come dessert time was a bit of a disappointment nothing major for me but my husband loves his sweets. If you're expecting a good dessert I would suggest you order separately. All in all I would say a very good place to eat, I will go back the spring rolls are rolling better than any dice in a casino!"
"Love Chinese food.. could eat it 3 times a day!

This is pretty good.. went twice.. once for lunch.

I like the pot stickers and the ribs.

Service is good, everyone very friendly!"
"Had a enjoyable meal. We were on a the second floor with a great view of the strip. We had a 4 course set meal. I have read reviews about the lettuce wraps we tried them and they were really good. 
 The staff were very friendly, polite and helpful. Would go back."
"Good service, nice place but food needed to be warmer. Free refills on soft drinks. Food came out quickly. I recommend Mongolian beef and the fried rice was delicious."
"For more information: See Mara Anderson-Hall, manager. Brian the ""new"" assistant manager does not belong here, until he is trained and polished. Imagine vegetables in a ""Chinese"" restaurant being cooked in a sautee' pan and not a WOK? The food is absolute garbage here!"
"Good value during happy hour!. Enjoyed a great meal on the deck and people watched! The service was attentive and the food was served quickly and tasted great. The waiter, Tom, was awesome! He provided good suggestions and actually saved me some money (more to gamble with). Great location and food."
Had the lettuce wraps and orange peel shrimp.  Awesome as always.  Location is great and staff is friendly.  Got in quickly and had great experience. Thanks!
"Online booking option was very handy, got a very nice view of the strip so we could people watch whilst we ate. 
Food was great as always. Let no room for dessert  :)"
Staying at the Elara which is connected to the Miracle Mile Mall our group ordered food from P.F. Chang's to take back to the room. Our food was fresh and tasted awesome even when walking back to our room. The portions were good sized so we have plenty left over to snack on later.
"We visited the restaurant on out first evening in Las Vegas, tired and hungry, the service was good and the cocktails were great.

Dinner was nice, we had spring rolls followed by 2 chicken dished with rice, the food was nice and service was fast."
"Went to PF Chang's for my birthday dinner started with the Lettice wraps it was delicious service was awesome, the whole experience was most enjoyable"
"Had a good dinner at PF Chang's with a friend. Greeted and seated without issue. Food was good; started with the Chicken lettuce wraps, Crispy Chicken and Fried Rice dishes. Service was friendly, food came out in a timely manner. All good, go see for yourself"
"P.F. Chang's has revised their menu ... the Chilean sea bass is fantastic!  We visited P.F. Chang's this week with friends visiting Las Vegas from Panama.  A good time was had by all.  The service was fantastic, as was the food."
"We dine here at least once during our visits to Las Vegas.  The service is great, and the prices will not break the bank.  Located in Planet Hollywood (the old Aladdin Hotel & Casino), the restaurant is easy access from the Las Vegas strip."
"This restaurant is located directly at the strip, so if you decide to go for an outside table (which we did) a good place to enjoy a nice meal and do some people watching. We ate there 2 times, and had no waiting time both times (usually a bad sign, but here everyone just kept waiting for an indoor table).  
The food was good as usual (the Crispy Green Beans are to die for), no premium prices for the location."
Stayed at Planet Hollywood so we had room service one night with P.F Chang's and was beautiful. Really fresh and tasty and good value for money!
"We always seem to fit in a trip to P.F. Chang's while in Vegas.  We like Planet Hollywood so this is a great choice for a quick bite.  The food is always good, the drinks are phenomenal and the staff is always friendly.  Good value!"
My food was excellent.  The taste was good. The service was great. They need to light up all the letters on the sign.
"Very busy restaurant. Great place for Chinese food, however, I believe that it is not quite as good as it use o be."
"Food is great. Be sure to get the lettuce wraps, they are awesome. You can often find a coupon in Vegas coupons for free appetizer and this includes lettuce wraps. Food is great with a variety of items to choose from. Service was fast and attentive. This restaurant has an entrance outside of Planet Hollywood."
"Get yourself a seat out on the sidewalk, enjoy the great service, delicious food, and relax while watching some of Vegas walk on by. Might want to check which direction the sun is going and choose your table/umbrella accordingly, as it can get pretty hot out there. Big shout out for their dry-rubbed spare ribs. Absolutely Devine."
"We stopped in on Monday night just after checking in at the Bellagio across the strip. We got seated in about 5 minutes. We got some sushi, fish tacos , rice dish and a few drinks. All of the food was great . drinks were potent...A+++"
"We had great service and a fantastic meal one week night at PF Chang's in Planet Hollywood. 
My boyfriend and I ordered the 2 meals for $50 and there was plenty to go around. That included an app, 2 entrees, and 2 small desserts. 
We sat next to a window and looked out onto the strip. We chose not to sit on the patio because at night it gets so loud with nearby music and traffic.
The guy server we had was great. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because I stepped back into a server carrying something (obviously I had no idea she was there) and after I apologized she gave me the worst look and didn't say anything back. She obviously hated her job, I was thankful we didn't get her as a server. The rest of the staff were very pleasant."
The food and service at the Vegas P F Chang's in Planet Hollywood was excellent. the service was outstanding. we enjoyed it very much.
"I had my birthday dinner and food was just spot on.We did not have reservation and just walked in, since we had to wait a little bit we received complimentary plate with some quick bites. It did not took long and we had a table, I ordered shrimps with melon and I totally loved it. Amazing foor, big portions, good prices. Definitely recommending."
"Went here for dinner on a Tuesday evening.,8 people for dinner. Had a round table on the upper floor in the corner with a bit of a strip view.
Our server was Ricky who was fabulous!
Meal was shared by all, had egg rolls, lettuce wraps, dried ribs ( very tasty) to start and then one order each of 4 dishes. 
Ended up ordering a couple more dishes once we figured out if we needed it. All tasted great. 
Completely recommend for a dinner for a group."
Great location right on the strip.  If you can get seating upstairs it's much more quiet and the views for people watching are excellent. Food is standard PF Chang's fare which is always enjoyable. Good place for a quick dependable lunch.
We tried two good dishes. The portions were good size and the flavor was very good. I would order both again. Neither dish contained too much sodium.
"PF Changs in Planet Hollywood is one of our must haves when visiting Las Vegas!  In fact, we usually eat there 2-3 times per vacation! 
The menu has a wide range of choices to satisfy everyone and also includes a fair amount of gluten free choices for people like myself who have Celiac.  
It's always quite busy and can have a long wait time to get in but it's always worth it!"
"We were a group of 10 people and tried out a lot of their dishes. It is really all good and tasty and I found the pricing resonably, compared to the general high level in Vegas. 
They should include Coca Cola in their selection and not offer Pepsi"
"cant believe how bad the food was here, bbq ribs were so sweet it must of been a mistake, the soup was weird with cherry tomatoes floating in it, the pad thai was a mushy mess not a bit of crunch or fresh veg in it, the salt n pepper prawns were totally bland just breaded shrimp on top of raw garlic and peppers which i could taste for the next 2 days. the tastiest thing about this meal was the fortune cookie!! must have been chefs night of as this was disgusting"
I have to say that the food was not nearly as good as we have had in the past. There was very little flavor to the chicken or the fried rice. We had 8 people in our group and everybody thought it was just ok. I will say the service was fantastic and they took very good care of us. We also noticed that even though we were there at 7:00 pm the place was almost empty.
"After a long day pounding the strip we settled on P.F Chang's for a late lunch and something a little different. We shared BBQ ribs and satay chicken as an appetiser. The meat just melted off the ribs and the flavours were bold. The main course, sesame chicken and street noodles were equally great. The wait staff were friendly and attentive without being over the top as can sometimes happen. We will definitely be visiting again and would recommend for others."
This restaurant was a great find we wanted a change from the usual chip meal. the menu was extensive but good value staff friendly without being too intrusive our waitress even recommend a dish we hadn't tried before which was great a restaurant with a calm feel in the mayhem of Vegas we visited at lunch and evening and the experience was good on both occasions
"A famous chinese chain of fine dining restaurants on the Las vegas strip in the Planet Holywood Casino, it is definitely worth a visit. Serving excellent chinese this restaurant knows it's food. As a group of approx. seven, with majority of us being vegetarians we really enjoyed the dishes. Entrees like Ma po tofu, buddha's feast and the pad thai noodles were really tasty. Drinking and eating merrily at this very stylish restaurant we ran up a tab of approx. 300$ which was pretty okay for a restaurant of this category. Highly recommended !"
Have visited f change in many cities. This location in particular  has a lot to learn and improve. Food comes out cold. Service is lousy and dishes are not the same way prepared as in other locations. Menu is the same but dishes are nor cooked in the same way. Too bad. It is one of my favorite places to have an oriental meal. Hopefully  they will catch up. I will come back and try them one more time.
Great Food Pleasant Staff Affordable Food And Drinks Always Able To Get A Good Table Will Tell My Friends
3 of us ate dinner here on our first night in Vegas.  Normally I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but my kung pao chicken was great.  The prices were a lot higher than what we pay at home but that's what you should expect in Vegas.  Service was very good. We had a table outside and watched an Elvis impersonator as well as a lot of other great people watching.
"We only had 3 main courses.  Unfortunately, one that they brought was incorrect so they had to replace it.  This left one of the party waiting a while until it was replaced.  They did however compensate us for this without being asked and didn't charge us for the main course that was late.  The food was all very tasty and two of them were good sized portions, one of them was quite a bit smaller than the other two but there was still plenty.  I had a non-alcoholic cocktail which was very refreshing.  Despite being very busy and except for the issue with the main course the service was swift and attentive.  particularly impressive was the fact that our waiter had his break in the middle of our meal but the problem with the main course had been clearly communicated when he returned."
"I've been to lots of PF Changs and usually won't even think of putting in a review for a chain restaurant because they all so similar, but this was an experience unto itself.

I guess this is PF Changs is better than any I've ever been to.  Its a mix of ambience, menu, and service, and no it wasn't just because it was Vegas, it's actually a great example for the brand.  Highly recommend this location of PF Changs."
"Return visit to this oasis of flavours in Planet Hollywood.

Extensive menu makes it difficult to decide but whatever you choose you won't be disappointed. Always busy and reservations recommended."
"Trendy Chinese food in the heart of Waikiki. The food, as I have come to expect at PF Chang's, is average at best.  Not worth the premium for the prime location.  Background music was way too loud to hold casual conversation and the service was less then attentive. Perhaps they can hire more servers to speed up to service.  Unless you are more concerned with being seen than eating a good meal, avoid this one."
"This was our first visit to this restaurant and we were delighted both with the food and service.  Our server Ulysses was fantastic.  He was very attentive, polite and accommodating.  He over heard my husband wish me a happy anniversary and later after our meal was over he also wished us both a happy anniversary.  Nice touch.

We ordered the dinner for two with lettuce wraps as an appetizer, sweet and sour chicken and beef and broccoli as the mains and chocolate dumplings for dessert.  When served, the beef and broccoli came as chicken and broccoli but we ate it anyway as it was delicious.  Our server came to ask us how the food was and we mentioned the error with the chicken instead of beef.  He immediately offered to have it replaced but we declined as we had started to eat and it was really good.  All of the food was really good.
To our surprise when we got our bill, the server had taken $16.50 off the food cost because of the mistake.  Another really nice touch, we would have paid it because it was so good.  We absolutely will go back the PF Changs on our next visit."
"I am trying to be honest as usual.
Lets just look at the facts as they pretty much
speak for what you can expect at this Chinese
restaurant...

1. Up to 2 hours from the time we were seated
until we left.

2. Waiters are like ''human sloths'' grumbling and
as slow as turtles on hot asphalt. Btw the place
smells of burnt food since thats what you get.

3. Ice tea was so sweet I could imagine crystals
rapidly forming in my bloodstream.

4. IceTea somehow was in a competition with the
massive salt load of the scorched broccoli beef.
Picture nice green broccoli and burnt beef jerky.
Not the tender succulent beef that Chinese chefs
are famous for, but something only a sasquatch
might be able to eat....with snow....SALTY.

5. Rice...was the broken cheap tiny rice again
colored brown to black by the addition of soy
sauce that was evaporated in a 1000 degree
wok so its all again SALTY.

I know the food must start out as edible but 
after the chef who was probably born in a
village near Sodom & Gomorrah got done
with it, your going to want to get up and leave
without paying, but if after 2 hours with no
ability to flag anyone for water and shifting
identities of who really is my waiter? I was
embarassed to skip out so I tried to pay
which took about 25 minutes of waiting
and my credit card seemed to be lost into
a black hole until someone pulled it out of
their pocket.

My rating also should include seating and
overall restaurant design...It was bizarre.
Like being trapped in a maze of tables and
no way out."
"We just ordered entrees, which arrived very quickly. Excellent tasting food and great, quick service."
"Beautiful food, can't remember what we ordered but it was gorgeous and a decent amount and not expensive either. On our last day of our holiday we were already booked in for Gordon Ramsay's pub and grill that night but really wanted another meal here so we ordered a few starters and a main and had a breakfast banquet. Well we were on our holidays..."
So nice we ate here twice on our holiday. The food was very fresh and the staff very friendly and helpful
"We went on a warm beautiful evening and sat outside where we enjoyed the sites of people walking the strip. We ordered the dinner for two which came with an appetizer, two entre'e and a dessert to share. The food was excellent ,very fresh and flavorful! Not your average oriental menu,."
"Typical PF Chang's, with good service and very good food for a very reasonable price. I went late on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. I like avoiding the lunch and dinner crush. Ordered some pan-fied pot stickers and the Salt and Pepper Prawns. Also got some kind ginger beer that was non-alcoholic, which was pretty tasty. The bartenders - at least one of them - was attentive and nice. But the highlight of my visit was when Adrianne Palicki (the stunning Tyra Collette from Friday Night Lights) walked in with some members of her family a bit before midnight and sat down at the bar to eat. I guess this is Planet Hollywood after all."
"Good food at reasonable rates, and since it is located inside Planet Hollywood on the street level, there is easy access, even if you are not a guest at the resort."
"Chain restaurant we ate at this trip. As always pretty steady nothing out of the ordinary. Just steady Kung pow chicken, salt and pepper prawns,  grilled dumplings. If you have a need for, steady chain Asian food this is your stop."
Had the Mongolian beef lunch special the dry rubbed ribs and lobster avocado roll. All were superb. Got to people watch as we sat on their outdoor deck. Waitress was the best we've had while here.
I think we will think twice about going here as much as we have in the past because they have raised the prices. It used to be a good fair deal for what you got but now I think it's expensive. The wine by the bottle is the best deal. Also they bring your food 5 minutes after you order it.
"The food is always excellent.  I travel a lot for work, and I always make a stop at PF Changs.   Try and sit on the patio outside if you can, or next to the glass windows facing the Strip.   I have also learned about their Happy Hour, which offers specials menu (smaller portions) on my of their specialties.    Or if you are traveling alone, or what a more quite place, tell them you want to sit up stairs in the bar."
"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  We've had Changers in 5 cities now and this one was one of the best.  Yum!"
"Lovely meal, loved the dumplings. Good portions, busy but no waiting great atmosphere and great service. Been many times including the one in Naples Florida"
I know this is a chain restaurant but this particular locale stands out for its phenomenal service! The food was delicious and served promptly. They get very busy before the show but do their best to serve you in a timely manner. The best part is the prices on the menu are the same as any other restaurant from the chain. Normally you experience steep price hikes in Vegas but not here.
Have eaten here a couple of times and both times got in before 6:00PM and had no trouble getting seated.  Service was a bit slow but the food is always worth the wait.  By the time we left the line to be seated was ridiculously long.  I just don't have time to wait in any line when in Vegas!
Had two really good night's here the food was excellent both times good location too. Located at the front of the planet Hollywood
"One of our first meals ever in Las Vegas was here and we have continued to visit every trip.
We noticed a bit of a decline in food and service last year but decided to stick with it.
This year was bad. Lukewarm food at best and very greasy/oily.
For the price it should be much better. Continues to be very busy so obviously a lot of first time traffic goes through here.

Think we will pass next year.

mpo"
"Ate here my first night in Vegas , the place was very busy when I arrived but thankfully I had reserved a table earlier that evening online on their website and was seated immediately .
This was the best Chinese food I have ever had it was amazing , the service was fast and friendly from our waiter Kyle , left very satisfied would highly recommend to all ."
"Me and my husband had dinner here on our recent trip to Vegas , and I was amazing everything from the food, to the staff, to the atmosphere. Do not go to Vegas without visiting."
"Great Happy Hour!!  Sit at the bar or on the patio 3-6pm. Try the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Pork Dumplings or the Salt and Pepper Calamari. They are all yummy. Only problem is after a reasonable Happy Hour snack here, you may not want to have dinner... If you are up for a drink try the Asian Pear Mojito.. Try it, you can't beat the value. Another must pencil in your Vegas trip...."
"Booked a table following a recommendation as we were on a tight schedule the days in L.A. We arrived & despite the booking we were asked to wait. They quickly found a booth after I'd said I wasn't happy as what is the point of booking!! Anyway, we ordered appetisers & mains with drinks for all four of us. The appetisers were fab but they delivered our mains halfway through eating it. We sent them back & asked them to wait until we'd finished only for them to come back again 5 mins later... We still hadn't finished. I had to make a point at this stage and was quite blunt. Stop rushing us, deliver our mains after we finished our appetisers. Eventually all was back on track & our mains arrived again (they said they had cooked it all fresh, they hadn't) the food was delicious despite the bad start but overall we felt rushed all the way through the meal. By the time we'd left at 8.45pm the restaurant wasn't busy at all so why did they need to rush us, who knows!

really good but they"
"Awesome food! Couldn't get enough of this place no matter what state I'm visiting. First ""chain"" restaurant worth finding, everywhere"
"Lovely service, fantastic food, reasonably priced - could not ask for more. Probably nicest chinese food ever!!"
"Our friend's introduced us to P F Chang's on our 1st night in town. Great service and food, highly recommend the Lettuce Wraps. Mmm can still taste them."
"So, I am addicted to Coke products. Pepsi is just not cool. And what do they have nearly everywhere on the strip? Not Coke. I was thrilled to find My Precious here, along with my dependable favorites...dumplings and lettuce wraps."
"Hubby and I always make it a point to eat here at least once when we are in Vegas. Fresh food cooked to order and so flavorful! We had dinner here one night, we both had the Cashew and Almond Chicken. I couldn't stop eating it. Large portions too. We also stopped in for an appetizer one night... the Chicken Lettuce Wraps! Excellent!"
"A decent PF Changs location. It offers all the standard Asian fare that they're known for. Service can be a bit slow, but it's to be expected when they're busy. Price according to Las Vegas!"
"Right in front at the Planet Hollywood casino, it can be pretty busy, but the food is good, and they have gluten free options too. Clean place with nice service."
"The food we had was tasty, but I expected a higher standard of cuisine in Vegas. This wasn't that much better than my local Chinese in Devon. We had satay skewers to start, which tasted OK, then had chicken dishes which were good but nothing special. Service was fast and efficient and the overall cost wasn't too high. I'd probably visit a place like this again, but with so many other restaurants in the area it might be worth trying a few of those out."
Love P.F Chang's. The restaurant looks really good and is easy to get to from the casino. The food was delicious and they give you tons. The price is really good for what you get and there service was amazing.
"Visited the las Vegas branch during our recent stay, we normally visit Chang's in VA and we love it. Las Vegas location did not disappoint. Well prepared and tasty food. lots of choice on the menu and fantastic mojitos as always. Great service too. A must visit in vegas."
"We really fancied a Chinese in Vegas and so visited this restaurant and so glad we did. Service was brilliant, portions huge so be aware of that. Food was lovely. Was so surprised how cheap it was when we got the bill will return when next in Vegas."
"After a long day we stopped here for a late dinner. The chicken that came with the lo mein tasted like shoe laces and was just as hard. Probably left over from the day before or at least tasted like it.  The drinks, however, were very tasty and worth seconds. I would stop in again for drinks once i had dinner somewhere else."
"Everytime we go to Vegas my husband and I make a B-line to PF Chang's.  The food is really good.  The best Mongolian Beef ever.  This time around we celebrated a friend's 40th with a banquet in the private room and it was a really good night, service was a bit slow, but as usual the food was fantastic.  Drink prices are very reasonable too."
This is a great place to eat.  I highly recommend the lettuce wraps!!  Request a booth.  Seems a little more private.  It's a busy place because it's so good.
"We stayed a the the Cosmopolitan opposite, so this restaurant was a short walk away. We booked a table which helped as the restaurant was busy and had some very large groups arriving at once. The service was quick, although we found we were being asked whether everything was ok, every other minute and it felt a little intrusive after a while.
We tried the pork dumplings and rainbow rolls for starters which were lovely. We shared a sweet and sour pork and a  beef and orange peel entree, both of which were huge portions but lacking any delicate flavourings. They came with steamed rice which we both felt was a bit bland and wished we'd ordered a fried rice dish instead. 
Overall, decent food for the price and we appreciated quick service due to our jet lag, but it was a bit impersonal."
"Excellent restaurant, fantastic food. Good set menu $49.95 per couple with choices. Staff very attentive. One of the best Chinese meals plenty of food.Could do with slowing down the service a little to allow resting between courses!!!"
"We were able to sit at the bar and order from the full menu. Service was great, and the food was good and plenty of it!"
"Stay off or even near to the Strip when it comes to chain restaurants. You can usually count on the quality of this chain restaurant for hot, tasty Asian fare. Not so in this case. It appeared our lunch dishes were precooked and sitting under a warmer for some time. Very disappointing!"
"We came here in our last night in Vegas as my American friend had recommended it, as we don't have it here in the UK. We had made a reservation and we were seated quickly but it took a while for us to get served, even for drinks. We were told that the servers were changing over their shifts. We had ordered some starters in the form of spring rolls and shrimp dumplings. Although they came quickly, the dumplings were taken away as soon as they were placed down as they were pork and not shrimp. It would have been nice of them to have left the dumplings as a mini apology

For my main, I opted for the Kung Pao Chicken with brown rice which was amazing. My other half and friend shared a big bowl of the Mongolian beef which I was assured was wonderful. The service improved throughout our main meal. Looking forward to returning on Bahrain at Christmas when I visit my parents"
"Everything was good as expected, awesome food.  We didn't get the perfect table as it was near the service door and had a lot of traffic.  The service was good, the only complaint was the waiter didn't ask if I was a member of their PF Chang's Preferred club, which I am, so I didn't get any points for the meal.  Other than that it was a great meal and we will go back."
"Great value for money.
We had two people in our party with a gluten allergy and this place went out of their way to help them with their own section of the menu. We had a lovely waitress and nothing was too big of a problem.
Be warned though the fishbowl cocktails are very strong!!!"
"As every other time I have been here. ... the food was amazing and our server was friendly, helpful and came to our table often  to check on us."
get a few dishes to share with a group you won't be disappointed and get a fishbowl cocktail the prices are very good and the food is delicious the honey chicken is to die for!
"Great food, Great service, Reasonable prices. Inside Planet Hollywood on strip. We did dinner for 2 for $49.00 which included appetizer. Do the lettuce wraps. two Entrees and one dessert."
Excellent food and view of the strip from second level.  Their chicken lettace wraps are so good.  Service was great as well.
"This restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood. Had dinner with friends (reservations needed) on a Thursday night. The place was packed. I believe this place is packed everyday, so reservations is a must. The waiter was very attentive and friendly, service was good. He even recommended that I sign up for their rewards program(for future free appetizers after a number of points accrued), just needed to give him the phone number registered and the current bill will also get points. They are billed as a Chinese restaurant, but I think that the fare is more American Chinese, not really authentic, but pretty good food. We ordered the firecracker shrimp and lettuce wraps for appetizer, had the Sea Bass, which was tasty and ample in size. Overall, this is a nice place to go for good service and delicious food, and caters well to a big group or family."
"We're regular customers of this restaurant in the woodlands Texas where the service is more than excellent. We arrived at 8:25 pm and were greeted and seated in less than 5 minutes up to then it was all good.
The bad part: server named Gus took our order but 15 minutes after seating and gasping for a drink, our ice teas were not even served, finally teas arrived with little ice, they then brought the wrong soup and left it there saying it was in the house, calamari was ok, server sent someone else who was inexperienced to serve us because he said he was going to be on break, teas were all melted and never refilled during an hour and 15 minutes we spent there, to get the bill another 15 minutes and the place was about 60% full , service slow and very bad like our waiter was not interested because we were a party of two , he preferred to serve a party of six that were seated next to us, ah and way more pricey than the same chain in Texas, NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL THEY STRAIGHT THEIR ACT, gets D-"
"Needed some late night food, and wondered in to pf changs. Man the food was good. Service was rapid too! Really enjoyed our food. Korean bbq chicken and kung pao chicken were our favs. But all of it was great!"
Love PF Changs. First port of call on any trip to Vegas.the location is terrific at the Planet Hollywood but also accessible from the Strip...Spare Ribs are amazing. In fact I've never had a bad meal. Prices are great; especially happy .
"The best service (Rick) and the best food. This place stands apart from any Chinese restaurant we have ever visited. Prices are ridiculously high as is the case anywhere on the Las Vegas strip, something you just have to learn to ignore."
"Sadly we don't have P.F. Chang's up in Canada where we live.. Have never been disappointed when I've eaten here in my Travels! Food is always hot, fresh, and the service has always been top notch. The serving sizes are always generous, and there is always something new to try. The experience at Planet Hollywood resort was no different! Highly recommended!"
This P. F. Chang's is inside the front of the casino. They have upstairs dining too. Always busy but food is great. Our server was outstanding.
"Disappointing service when compared to other PF Changs we've visited before. The restaurant was busy when we visited but not all tables occupied. The hostress tried to take us up 3 flights of stairs to our table. When I explained that my dad couldn't get upstairs..she seemed annoyed to get us a table downstairs. She seated us away from any other customers so hardly any of the servers visited our table. Food was nice but only provided 1 small bowl of rice for 4 people. Service was slow to provide more rice and drinks. At the end of the bill, we left our money and a tip. Then on our way out of the restaurant, the server ran after my mum accusing us of not leaving enough money. When he did a recount...it was all there. No apology or anything. We wouldn't visit this particular location again after that!"
"I went with my family and we have a good services with a regular ok food.
The restaurant is nice clean"
"Our first visit here... Food was good, fast service.  Busy place though and noisy so isn't someplace you linger."
"Good food for a chain.  They offer happy hour in the late afternoon, offering half price appy's (during the week only).  Good central location and a nice place to stop for a late afternoon bite.  Lettuce wraps are fabulous."
We ate here tonight and had a great experience. Lovely setting with excellent food and service along with great value for money would return and recommend.
"Liked: Always dependable service that aims to please. 
Food: Tasty food that accommodates everyones eating differences
(meat, fish, vegetarian, vegan, no nuts)
Don't like: Sometimes the food is rushed and comes out wrong but they do make up for it. That is appreciated."
"This place is always busy....good sign in any restaurant.
We ate from the fixed price menu which is superb value.
Busy atmosphere with quick and efficient service but you are not hurried and the food is excellent. Really recommend you give it a try."
"good food, always same as what you would get at any other PF Chang chain restaurant.  Attached to Planet Hollywood Casino, good service."
Great food and excellent service.  Highly recommended!  We went twice in our a 6 day stay.  Lettuce wraps are excellent as is the Hot and Sour Soup.
"I ate here twice last week whilst attending a trade shoe in LV. Both times the staff were friendly, helpful, and efficient. It always seems busy and the staff more than manage. Really recommend the Singapore noodles and Pork Wontons (fried). Prices for LV are very fair indeed- obviously its not Panda Express- which in turn is terrible. I'd really recommend PF Changs. The only reason it does not achieve 5 stars is due to overall cleanliness levels on both visits but as said they were very busy. GO to PF Changs!!!!!!!"
"The staff are so friendly! I got take out a couple of times and it was very fast and efficient!
The food is so good and I'd highly recommend it!"
"While I feel the food has gone down hill slightly in the past year or so, this is still a place that is one of my fav's. The dumplings are to die for. Wine is rather inexpensive compared to most other  places. The Mongolian Beef is incredible... and my new favorite is the Sea Bass. OMG!!! its really good!"
"Great food, great service, loved the price and the craft beer and the wine. Couldn't have had a better recommendation."
the food here was excellent...there was so much to choose from I had to take it easy...the only thing was that it was very crowded but overall it was very good and anyone could go and enjoy because it is buffet style so you can try some of everything.
"Visited the restaurant in August '15 on my trip to Vegas. The food and service was amazing. Even though the restaurant was packed we were seated quickly ( we had expected waiting). The staff was courteous and friendly, always goes a long way in making an outing for guest pleasant. Being vegetarians, there was quite a lot of variety and the staff even made an effort to make the dishes without meat from the non veg menu to make it eatable for us. Food tasted great as well. 

All in all we had an pleasant experience at P.F Chang's and would definitely go back to this place."
So i was part of a large party and they all wanted to come to PF Chang. It definitively is not my favorite restaurant. i for one am not a fan of chinese food and out of the 15 dishes that came out i only had about 3 of them. the others seemed to like it but my daughter and i did not..
"Great food, great service, great place get down here and give it a try. Especially try the baby ribs and the tacos."
"Having been to PF Changs before in Florida we were already aware of the menu. We had delicious lettuce wraps and then a chicken and a beef dish. The garlic noodles are a must but are very flavoursome. We went here before seeing the Britney show at planet Hollywood, the service was excellent with some good recommendations on our food."
Is there a 3.5 star? Because while I usually love PF Chang's the wait service on this trip was severely average while the food was above average.
"Went to PF Chang's after a hard days gambling at the Planet Hollywood casino and had a great experience.

Although we had no reservation we were immediately showed to a table by a friendly and welcoming hostess. The menu was extensive and anyone who like Chinese cuisine will have no trouble finding a dish that they like. Service was prompt and the food was cooked to perfection.

If you are a fan of the American take on Chinese dishes then I would recommend this restaurant  to you."
"I enjoyed P.F Chang's atmosphere at PH. The staff was great and the food was just as amazing. Had drinks, food and great company.  We had a small issue and without any questions they took care of it. A great time."
We made reservations for Friday night and when we arrived we were promptly seated. I had the scallops and they were excellant. There were at least 12 decent sized scallops. I should have took a picture.
"We've visited PF Changs in Planet Hollywood several times before, and ate there twice on our most recent Vegas trip. The food was delicious as always. We chose to sit at the bar, and both times we received excellent service. We were disappointed there had been some menu changes and some of the items we liked were no longer available, but I suppose menu changes are a necessity in the restaurant industry. This place is always busy, so I highly recommend reservations. I've always made reservations in advance without difficulty, and it allows you to bypass the large number of people typically waiting at dinner time. We'll definitely be back!"
We decided to drop into this restaurant after seeing Jeff Dunham at PH earlier in the week. The food was decent sand the service even better. Our server was a young man from the Phillipines and he really did provide fantastic service. Well worth a visit.
I wanted a small meal after a concert and this fit the bill perfectly.  I had the chicken wraps and they were delicious!
"We had a great table overlooking the strip. The wait staff was friendly and efficient. Best of all, the prices were in line with what I'd expect to pay at my local PF Chaings."
I'm a local and I really enjoyed the food atmosphere and the good service even my out of town family loved it not really overpriced as strip restaurants can be food was excellent service was efficient and the house drink specialties were good too
"Had dinner on the Strip at P.F. Chang's.  Although crowded, our party of two was immediately seated.  The service was quick, attentive and excellent.  The food, as always, was great."
The service was below average as the waiter had a lot of tables.  The food tasted good and the restaurant offers a good view of the strip.
"I know it's a chain restaurant, but when you walk into this Las Vegas restaurant you feel like you're on vacation - it is beautifully decorated with high ceilings and Asian décor - it's a comfortable setting with friendly staff and deliciously made food.  I've been there several times now and I'm never disappointed!  Get half price apps during happy hour - the food portions are large and we usually pick three or four dishes to share.  Their desserts are so pretty that even though you feel as though you may bust, you'll order one!!  Nice little parfaits that temp and satisfy!!"
"P.F. Chang's is always busy and for good reason; the food is great and the atmosphere very lively. Had the calamari and the chicken lettuce wraps, along with lobster rolls. All three were excellent. Service was very fast and attentive. This is a great option mid-strip. There is usually a bit of a wait, but you can play the slots close by while you wait."
PF Changs is always very consistent with their food and this place was no different. The food and the servicce was excellent and its a nice less expensive choice on the strip for a family.
"THis is a must go to restaurant for us everytime we visit vegas....food is inexpensive, plentiful, fast and very very tasty!!!"
I work in the restaurant industry for 12 plus years and know good and bad service when I see it. we were a group of 7 and were treated awesome by our server. The food came out fast and hot and it was delicious and affordable. My first time at the chain and not my last.
"The foot at this PF Chang's was very similar to the quality you get at most PF Chang's.  So if you're a fan of the chain, then you'll like this one.  Where I thought this restaurant stood out was in their service.  Most restaurants on the strip, especially chains, have spotty service at best.  The service we received was better than almost any other mid-range restaurant we've visited in Vegas.  I don't know if that's their usual level of service or if we just caught them on a good day, but they were outstanding."
"Good food and service as always but we spent more time waiting on a table than we did, sitting at it. I took my than boyfriend there for dinner and for a small plate of duck the price with rice was $60. I agree in thee ""while in Vegas,"" motif but PF Changs here in Texas doesn't seem to high. I chose this place because I figure it would be better however no complaints on FOOD just the wait."
"We ate at PF Chang's one evening and was not disappointed with our meal.   Our server was attentive and polite.  The food was prepared to order.  (In our group, there are some special dietary requests).  My group of 7 enjoyed the appetizers of salt and pepper calamari and egg rolls.  We enjoyed the soup - egg drop.  The entrees were delicious - crispy honey shrimp and crispy honey chicken, beef and broccoli, shrimp fried rice. A great dining experience."
Service is amazing. Food is beyond delicious. Very safe for celiacs to eat here - they are extremely attentive and careful. Portions are huge so share or go at lunchtime for a cheaper meal but still filling.
"We try to avoid chain restaurants when we are in Las Vegas BUT after trying a couple of Chinese restaurants on the Strip and ending up disappointed with what we've tried, my family and I decided to give P.F. Changs a go as they are a fail safe option when it comes to Chinese food. The first night we were there, we received awesome service from Jose. The food was good as expected and the prices were not jacked up like most eating places on the Strip. They were pretty comparable to other P.F. Changs that we've been to. The second night we went, our server was well, okay. She was brusque and not very courteous, tried to act like she knew better than we did regarding our order and what we wanted. Did not appreciate that at all. She was only slightly friendlier when it came time for the check...gee, I wonder why. Because of her poor service and in spite of Jose's awesome service, I will have to give P.F. Changs an average rating on service. Despite her poor service, I have to say the meal was still good. If ever in need of a fail safe dining option in Las Vegas, go to P.F. Changs."
"Booked ahead as it was 4th July and very pleased we did.
5 of us including 3 teenagers, all had very nice food and a booth to ourselves.
Good service without being too cheesy.
Nice wine.
Would go again."
"Located inside Planet Hollywood, so it was easy to find. 
We came here at 1.40pm for late lunch. They seated us almost immediately, even without a reservation. Our server was very courteous and kept checking up on us to see if we're doing fine.
We ordered the Chicken lettuce wrap as starter, this was delicious. I ordered Orange Peel chicken (which didn't have a spicy sign, but should, I love it though!) and my sister ordered Chang's spicy chicken (which had a spicy sign but shouldn't).
If it's just two of you, make sure to pick the lunch set menu, unless you're sure you can finish the HUGE individual dishes ."
"Wanted a great dinner but not the high dollar amounts as some charge.  We discovered Chang's across from Bellagio, in Planet Hollywood.   Service as always great, as well quality of food.  
Chicken lettuce wraps and finer entries from the menu...good choice here for the money."
"Came here for an early dinner prior to a show.  Seated right away, and food was hot and delicious.  Can't miss with PF Chang!"
"Just ok
Excellent service
Food was a bit bland and the chicken over cooked 
Quite venue for a business meeting 
I will return but maybe for dinner over a cocktail"
Food was good and portions were a reasonable size.  We had the set meal for 2 which was a good option.  Average price $25 per person & drinks
"Firstly, the PF Chang's in Planet Hollywood makes you feel ""Special"" when you walk in. Hip decor, a buzz in the air and the feel that you are a member of the ""A"" list community.

Now for full disclosure, my latest dinner visit (last week) was for a friend's 4-day stag so recollections may have been slightly off.

Our total food bill (1-2 drinks each) was amazingly low at $36 X five guys (groom's cost was split). 
Started with 2 plates of lettuce wraps ... then 4 plates of the usuals (can't recall what though). I do remember it was very good.

The evening did have an interesting ending with a friend on top of their really big horse outside ..... NOT SOMETHING I WOULD SUGGEST YOU EVER DO .... NOPE .... NEVER .... DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT :)"
"Typical PF Chang's fare, but on the Strip.  Prices slightly higher than what we get at home, but still very good.  Service was excellent.  Still wish they'd bring back the 'mix the sauce' at your table.  Something that set them apart...."
The quality of food and service varies from location to location--not always consistent.  Fairly quick seating; despite a twenty minute wait.  Lettuce appetizer; exceptionally good. Seafood entree/chicken entree were served hot with multiple sauces.  Martinis were fair..not strong!!  Service was adequate!!
My wife being asian likes rice and noodles a lot. We can all find something on the menu that is good for our individual tastes. We frequently travel with our adult children and this is one of our favorite eats. It is at the Planet Hollywood Casino. We go here even when we are staying at a different hotel.
"From a spoiled Vancouverite, food in this American-Chinese restaurant is well above average.  Service, ambience and foods were impressive.  We went there twice during our stay at the hotel.  They were actually cheap comparing to other dinings in Vegas.  Highly recommended."
"We ate at the Planet Hollywood location for dinner one night during our Vegas trip.  The wait for a table was 15/20 minutes so we were told the bar was full service and we sat there to dine.  All of the bartenders were very attentive and friendly.  When we received our food, a group of 5 or so men and women parked it next to us. They were very loud and practically sitting in my lap. Immediately you could tell the 2 women were intoxicated.  They were so loud I couldn't enjoy my dinner. All of a sudden I had beer and pieces of beer bottle splattered all over my leg due to the one woman dropping her full bottle of beer.  They told the bartenders that she had dropped it and it was cleaned off the floor right away.  The female bartender gave her another beer for free.  The group then got called to their table and the drunk woman dropped her second bottle of beer. Could've seen that coming.  Not once did anyone offer us a drink or apologize for the woman breaking glass and beer all over my legs.  When we left the restaurant I felt something in my foot and it was a piece of the brown beer bottle! Must have went in my flip flop when it was dropped.  That was awesome!  Not really anyone's fault although I wouldn't have served the obviously intoxicated guest and then catered to them instead of a couple sitting at the bar quietly trying to enjoy their dinner."
"PF Chang's is a chain, so what you're looking for truly is whether or not your experience is consistent. And that it is at the Las Vegas location in the Planet Hollywood Casino.
I am a fan, this was no exception."
"Can not say enough about PF.  Love the food and the service is always excellent.  Love the lettuce wraps, and hot and sour soup."
We eat here when in Vegas as it's cheaper than the strip and the service is better- bottle of our favourite wine was $ 20 here compared to double that on the strip! Food is excellent as always!
"Food was fantastic! Service fantastic! Take home half of it . . Plenty of food, fresh and well cooked, and presented."
"this restaurant does not disappoint. I really like all the food that they have but you can not beat the ""great wall of chocolate""!"
"Same menu as at all P. F. Chang's.  This one is located on The Strip in the hotel Planet Hollyood.  Love their hot and sour soup and lettuce wraps!  Delicious cocktails.  Try the Key Lime Pie cocktail -- very refreshingly!
Good couples place.  Would be pretty spendy for a family.  Much more than the typical Chinese restaurant,"
"I was excited to try P.F. Chang's and found the restaurant to have a great atmosphere (we sat on the second floor) and pretty good service. I ordered the spicy Beef a la Sichuan and was disappointed to find that 1) it wasn't spicy, it was more sugary sweet and 2) the meet was over cooked and very, very chewy like beef jerky.  The flavor sort of grew on me as I ate it, but not as advertised.  The best part of mine or my wife's meal was the egg rolls, which were fantastic.  Next time I'm in the mood for Asian, I""ll give another place a try instead."
"It was my first time at PF Chang's. Really good food, specially to share. The service is also very good, smiling people working. I recomend!"
Everything was so tasty. Also the service was excellent. The prices were not bad either for what you got. Would definitely go there again next time I am in the US
"I've been to P.F. Chang's a number of times in a number of different cities and I enjoy it.  We were looking for a place to eat at around 11 pm after coming out of one of the Cirque shows and I saw P.F. Chang's so we decided to eat there. The wait was about 25 minutes which I thought was pretty reasonable.  I was with my fiancee and her two Aunts who were in America for the first time.  They'd never had Chinese 'fusion' before - and they seemed to be pretty impressed by the entire experience.  Service was good.  If there was a 3 1/2 I'd probably rate it there - there wasn't anything particularly remarkable (to me) about this P.F. Chang's, but certainly no negatives."
We went for lunch this time and as always it was delicious and service was top notch.  Our waitress was training another Waiter and I thought we would receive poor service but it was not the case.  Love the food and atmosphere.
Tempura Shrimp was good.  Had grill Salmon with brown rice and my ginger beer.  Service was great very nice waiter.  Good size portions.  Will go back again.
"This is by far the best Asian inspired restaurant I have ever been to in my life.  We came here twice during our visit to Vegas. The service was so amazing, the second time we turned up our waiter remembered us and even our drinks order!
Chinese food in Australia is not very good, so this was so refreshing - the dishes are very modern and fresh.
We tried the following: Spring Rolls (to die for), egg rolls, Korean BBQ chicken stirfry, Pepper steak, Mongolian beef, Salt & pepper calamari (the best). Wish we had food like this at home, the atmosphere and the prices also really awesome."
"3 different meals and 4 different appetizers that were excellent.  The 4th meal was Pad Tai.  I would skip this until your inside a Tai restaurant.  The flavor wasn't even close to what I get at our local Tai restaurant in Phoenix.  I did sample all other meals and appetizers and they were great.  Sushi was out of this world good, I ordered the Kaleidoscope Sushi and none of us were disappointed.  If we are in this area in the future we would return to this restaurant."
"Very tasty food and staff was really nice and we totally enjoyed eating here, even though the light was a little dim."
"I know PF Chang's is a chain restaurant, but even still, they make fantastic food! Very tasty, great selection, fab cocktails, big spacious restaurant. Good service. Decent wine list. Fantastic location - we ate here just after shopping in the Miracle Mile Mall and just before going to see the show Zombie Burlesque. Their Honey Chicken is just delicious."
"Excellent service in a city that has so many other options to choose from.  Since this is a chain restaurant, i was hesitant about eating here, however it was hot and the inside seating was a welcome relief to the sun.  The food came out super quick and was cooked and served perfect, and really, for the price, you can't be this food"
"An example of this is the lettuce wraps. This location serves the sauce already mixed, but in other locations they mix it to your liking."
"We have eaten at this particular P.F.Changs in the multiple times in the past.  As always the food is good, the service is good, and the wait times are reasonable.  A good variety on the menu, and they will make your order to suit you if you do not like things spicy.  If you get there by 6 PM, you can usually get seated right away. I am a Warrior Rewads member, and was supprised that they took the highest costing entre off the bill.  I was entitled to a free entre, and expected to have the cheapest dinner deducted from the bill.  We went back a second time on this visit."
Love PF Changs.  The LV location is small but food is consistently good.  My favorite is the Beef ala Sechuan paired with garlic noodles.  Spicy !
"We entered from the PH casino floor, at first it didn't resemble an Asian restaurant, it was full (a good sign) and very noisy. Once we had a table and viewed the menus, differant story. A great selesction at reasonable Vegas prices.  Our american waitress was very helpfull with our drinks selection and when it looked that we were ordering too much, she advised us of the portion sizes and thankfully we listened. The food was excellent and plentifull."
Enjoyed my dinner at P.F. Chang's during a recent trip to Las Vegas.  The food and service was excellent.
We visited here for a late lunch. It's inside the Planet Hollywood.  The food was good but their prices were jacked up- possibly due to location. . . A bit of a walk to get to if you're parking your car.
"The waiter was the only waiter on staff that afternoon and he was new. He was the nicest young man, he did awesome!!! Very attentive, polite and personable. I expect to see him when I go back, he actually invited us back and said he would be there! You have an exceptional man there to represent you PF Changs."
"I really like the orange chicken.  A nice spice, and sharing is always good here.  Lot's of choices and flavors to choose from."
"We had reservations for 9:30 after Jeff Dunham's show.  The place was packed, and there was a waiting line, but we were led to our table at 9:30 sharp which overlooked the strip, making people watching part of the fun.

We regularly order just appetizers at PF's.  This time we tried the new Jicama Street Tacos, along with the tried and true spare ribs, pork dumplings and crab wontons.  As always, the food was served quickly, was presented nicely, and tasted great.  

P.F. Changs never disappoints, and it is one of the best values on the strip.

DG"
"Although a chain restaurant the quality of food and service was above average. It was great to be able to have things i wouldn't normally be able to have due to my gluten intolerance. The amount of food ordered between us could of easily fed a family of four. The lettuce wraps for starters is a must and they almost give you a full lettuce. The service was also really good with an informative waitress on both food and drinks.
Loved the food so much visited the same restaurant in Hawaii."
"For a chain restaurant, the service and food are above and beyond average.  It is actually a superb fine dining experience from the wait staff to the food itself.  I am a big fan of their lettuce wraps and as usual, they were delicious."
Excellent as usual and conveniently located in Planet Hollywood. I went twice while I stayed for Memorial Week.
"Great atmosphere, ask for a window side seat which is great for people watching on the strip. Wait staff was very attentive, food was timely and excellent. It was an awesome experience overall.  I wish every restaurant would take notes from this team at PF Changs inside Planet Hollywood."
"Not the first time in this chain, first time in this specific branch.

Set on the bar.

Fast professional and personal service.

Great surrounding and atmosphere. 

The food as always... really delicious... even if not very authentic.

Price is on the little high side for a Chinese restaurant... but it is definitely worth it."
"We visited the restaurant for supper one evening on a recent trip. Our server was very attentive and explained the menu and made perfect recommendations for each of us. Thermal was reasonably priced and helped down by a bottle of champagne that cost half of the price we paid at our hotel ....
A relaxed restaurant with a friendly Atmosphere .... Well worth a trip if you enjoy a great Chinese meal."
"Excellent Food Choice for Oriental Cuisine in Vegas, high quality and super services. Highly recommended for people loving oriental cuisines"
"this chain is always pretty busy, the food is yummy & I didn't have to send anything back. waiting for a table was the hard part!"
You can choose either an indoor or outdoor table and I would say this was the best Chinese meal I have ever had. Spring rolls and ribs for starters were light and tasty. Mains were delicious and very well presented. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit.
"We were leaving Las Vegas later in the day and were wanting a late lunch before going to the airport.  A shop assistant in the nearby mall recommended P.J.Changs and we decided to try it.  The inside dining area was nice but dark and we chose to sit outside - some of the food and drink choices were slightly cheaper if you sat outside.  We really enjoyed our food - starters of crispy wantons and pork dumplings, followed by orange chicken and chicken with cashews and almonds.  The service was efficient and friendly and we enjoyed the food here more than at the other supposedly high end restaurants in our 5 star hotel."
This is my second time eating at P.F Chang's and I will return again! Six of us ate family style for under $150. Great food!
"On our 25th wedding anniversary trip. We love the food here and have been many times back home. Luckily, found a coupon for a free starter in the map we got from a Tix 4 Tonight ticket stand when we purchased show tickets. Great service (Ivan). Manager even came by to check on us and when we told him about our anniversary, he offered us a free desert. Highly recommend."
"I was disappointed to see that the menu has changed.
The quality of food has decreased slightly, but the service is always fast and courteous"
"We had lunch here during a recent visit. It is the best Chinese we have ever had. Fantastic service, great food, big portions, & well priced. Loved it."
"My partner and i had been recomended here by a friend who has visited PF changs before claiming it to be delicious and amazing, As both fans of a good chinese (not greasy crud) we decided to head over and have a break from ""american"" food. 

We were sat down in a dark corner ( the whole place being dark) and eventually had our drinks and food order taken. We ordered a variety of dishes so we could try several things which is what chinese/indians are all about! 

The food arrived and it was not what i expected, a lot of the food was overly salted and covered in oil, it was as if i'd gone down my local chinese and poured it onto a plate! In the end we gave up barely eating half the food before paying and leaving. I ended up grabbing a burger on the way home as i wanted something that tasted of something other than oil and salt!

Overall i would not visit a pf changs again."
We love the food here and in fact we have eaten more than a dozen times over five years. We like the vegetables cooked properly. Appears to have little or no msg. The sweet and sour chicken was not overlooked and chewy. All dishes as this restaurant are excellent .
"We have been to PF Chang restaurants from Bellevue, WA to Palm Beach, FL. and this was the worst.  We went for an early dinner before a show, the food was average at best.  The popcorn at the show had more flavor than the honey shrimp.  The service was average and the environment less than average.  There are a lot of good places to eat in Vegas, this is not one of them."
My wife & I eat here just about every chance we get. I ate here while on business and the food was great.  You must always get the lettuce wraps as an appetizer.  My main meal is almost always brown rice and Mongolian beef. They have a nice outdoor section as well which was enjoyable on this low 80 degree temp evening.
We really enjoy PF Changs.  They are a short walk from the Paris where we were staying.  Ordered a few of our favourite appies and a cold drink.  No wait to sit down at lunch time which was nice.  Have been here for dinner when it's quite busy.  Good service.  Great food.
"First time going there so I had to figure out the menu I decided since it was myself and my husband to want to two entrées we audit sweet-and-sour chicken and broccoli and beef, and of course these items are shareable and to say that they were good is an understatement.  It was excellent."
This restaurant is very attractive and has a happy hour and a great bar. Staff is friendly and will to seat you where you like..The food is always good and the price is good to fair for Vegas...
"We ate here for my birthday and from start to finish the entire experience was fantastic! 
Even though we arrived at peak dinner time we were seated within 5 minutes. The staff were super friendly, and our waiter was quick to offer popular dish suggestions which we decided to try. He also suggested we try one of the popular punch bowl cocktails for two. Not only was it delicious, but it was absolutely huge, and great value for money! Our meals arrived promptly and they too were huge and mouth wateringly good! 
Even after eating our fill we had a lot left. Our waiter was more than happy to place our leftovers into containers for us to take back with us. 
Definitely a 10/10!"
"PF Changs is almost always a stop when I'm in LV or in Chicago.  I've never had a bad meal there. The decor is cool, I always have great waitstaff.  I'm never disappointed."
"The portions are large and family styled so my husband and I split a main dish, side dish and appetizer. The food was very tasty and fresh. Service was very good. I am gluten free and they had many choices."
"PF Chang's was recommended as being excellent so we were looking forward to going. First impression was good - on the strip, lovely decor, seated quickly. Hostess came and introduced herself & took drinks order but seemed rushed & grumpy then came back to take food order - wasn't particularly helpful when we asked questions! Starters arrived with a soup missing for one, when we asked she questioned us, we explained we wanted one bowl as a starter but a large tureen arrived. Main courses were good but nothing spectacular. After a nearby table left the hostess was very chatty with us and asked if we wanted desert but we declined and asked for the bill. We placed the $ inc tip into the wallet and were preparing to go when she came back - she asked if we realised we had 'only' left $$ as a tip!!!! (We left a reasonable amount) considering the service we had received from her and said yes we realised at which she huffed off!!!  Not over impressed and definitely the worst service we received all week."
"Great menu choice, lovely surroundings and quality food. Did feel a little rushed though as next course arrived before previous ones cleared away"
"The offerings here are really wonderful, with the scallops and appetizers excelling for taste and value."
"4 of us went on Friday night and the place was full but got seated quickly.  We had Chicken Kung Pow, Mongolian Beef, Street Noodles, Salt and Pepper Prawns, Lemon chicken and a Lobster roll.  Everything was perfect and we will return!"
"You can not beat excellent Chinese food in P.F. Chang. This authentic Chinese food restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood on strip. Service, seating and bar are good. Staff is very friendly. One of our friend having nuts allergy. Manager was very helpful in giving menu with certified food without nuts. That was great. We went couple of times for dinner and every time we visited we enjoyed it more. They have in door and out door seating area."
"Went here after rock of ages for late night food and it was first class. Great choice of food, reasonable prices as not in hotel, delicious meal and highly recommended"
"Real nice. Sat on upper floor for view of strip. Think quieter here on upper floor. Service was great. Had shrimp and lobster sauce. Excellent. Very tasty. Ordered brown rice and tea. All good. Would recommend, but need reservations."
"This place is near the Planet Hollywood/Strip area.   It was a zoo the day I went, but that said, it was nice and sunny and I sat outside to enjoy the food and people watching over Super Bowl Sunday weekend 2015.   There were all sorts of 'characters' - people dressed up in costume from Despicable Me, Star Wars, etc., doing Photo Ops, etc. for money."
"My wife and I were catching a show at the Planet Hollywood Showroom and got dinner here before the show.  It was a busy Saturday night however, the service was fairly quick and the food very good.  My wife and I have eaten at this location before and the food has always been very good and the service is always at least average or better.  I would recommend this location if you are visiting the Planet Hollywood Casino and/or Miracle Mile Shops that are in this same location."
"The sweet and sour soup was awful, don't try it. the main entrees were so so. The wonton appetizer were good....but didn't make up for the rest of the dinner. First time I had anything `poor from PF"
Delightful dinner on a Saturday evening was the result of our drop in to P.F. Changs.  The staff was friendly.  Our waiter was warm and personable and shared is knowledge of the menu.  The Wanton dessert was exceptional.
"PF Chang's patio is one of the best places on the strip to people watch - across from Aria and Cosmopolitan. Planet Hollywood is an exciting hotel with great restaurants! We tried the Mongolian Beef and Pad Thai, both amazing. I highly recommend sharing a few dishes so you can try more entrees out that way - the flavors are mouth-watering and the service excellent. I will be back."
"Romantic, great view of the strip from the patio. Food was delicious! Loved the hot and sour soup and spring rolls!"
"Good food, As always, I have been a fan of PF Changs food for quite a while and been to there restaurants in multiple states.
This location was no exception - it was just very busy as its right on the strip. Service was excellent and the food was good. It was a bit on the expensive side at $75 for lunch with no alcoholic drinks but someones got to pay for the prime location I suppose!"
"We eat at our local changs back home regularly, so knew we would love this place. Of course we did, and we are glad we came here rather than taking a risk with somewhere else. We went to the one in Planet Hollywood."
My wife and I try and go to the PF Chang in Planet Hollywood on each visit to Vegas.  We do not have one in our home town so it is a welcome change.  I always love their new creations on the apps menu.  We usually order several and share.  It may be a little pricey but the food and service is always excellent.  I would recommend getting different items and sharing.  We always find something new we like doing it that way.
"We love this chain of Chinese food restaurants and this particular location did not disappoint. We always order their famous lettuce wraps, which are almost a meal on their own. Perfect dinner choice before a show due to fast and efficient service. Recommend you make a reservation and then get there a little early, seem to be always busy and overbooked...arguably a good thing."
"Well what a meal!! Just returned from vegas and was pleasantly surprised by this place ..
Was a very large restaurant but ordered and three or four minutes later .. Our meal was delivered by a lovely young man by the name of charles.. 
There was so much food we couldn't finish it ( we could have had it put in a take out box to leave with but didn't) 
The food was fresh, piping hot and soooo good ! 
Charles couldn't do enough for us and was a pleasure to talk too so PF CHANGS, , he is a credit to your restaurant!! 
A bit more money than some places but you pay for wat you get and the whole dining experience was value for money 
We will be returning when we next visit vegas ! ...
And the view opposite the bellagio was perfect ...."
"I love PF Changs anywhere I go. So, when we needed a quick bite to eat upon our arrival and check in at our hotel, this was perfect. They are consistent in their ""deliciousness."""
"The food portions are all very big and you will do well to get through a full starter and main course. In a big group, it is a good idea to order less main courses than the number of people and share in the middle of the table as there are plenty of choices on the menu to go for."
"Ate at PF Chang's during my visit to Las Vegas and I would recommend this restaurant not necessarily for the food which was good but for the view from the outside seating area. It was a nice cool day in May, so outside was great. The view of Las Vegas and the foot traffic is really nice/interesting. I ate the Orange Shrimp and Shrimp Fried Rice. Both were good but nothing special. The California Roll Sushi, also OK but nothing special. I would recommend the restaurant for the outside seating."
"Went to PF Changs last night with my family. Made a reservation, so we didn't have to wait.  Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful. Our waiter started off the evening  providing the best service we've ever had. He apparently became busy later, and service greatly suffered after that.. The food was good. You can never complain about the lettuce wraps at PF Changs. I had a lemon Cantonese chicken that was very good. Enjoyed the sampling my son's lobster fried rice. The decor was restaurant chic. Tables. We're very close together. The only restroom is outside the restaurant. Whose idea was that? All in all, a good, although not great, visit. Would go back in the future."
Had the chang's dinner for two shabang and it was delicious. Food was prompt and everything and more than imagined. Plenty of time to make our show after. And the dessert wonton may be the best thing I've ever tasted. Nom Nom Nom. Thanks Jose for the great service.
"Okay so the first 3 nights we were in Vegas we dined at each of our hotels main dining room/restaurant Starting at the Luxor, Planet Hollywood & I think Aria? And we spent crazy $$$ then we were outside pf changes on the 4th day and we were like agh why not. OMG! Great food for a good price! We went the 5th day too :)"
"When we stayed at Planet Hollywood we went for dinner to PF Changs at the hotel.  It was pretty busy but the service was still good and as my family are all vegetarians, we usually have limited choices at some restaurants, but this place has a good variety to pick from."
"I liked their version of Asian food, it is also easy to choose something for kids. Always recommended"
"We love chinese, especially with a lot of flavour. We ordered the entree of vegetarian spring rolls and the flavour was fresh and tasty when wrapped in lettuce and coriander. We had the beef and broccoli and the chicken and prawn dish. What I liked, was the fact that you didn't leave thirsty like some restaurants that use msg.
I terms of service, we had a very attentive waiter and she was always checking on us and helping us. Would definitely go back!"
"Decided to try P.F. Chang's for the first time while in Vegas. Ate at 1:00pm and ordered from the lunch menu which has most of the regular menu items at slightly smaller portions and significantly smaller prices. Food was really good. Our server was very good. Restaurant atmosphere is quite nice and clean. Considering its location on the strip, the lunch menu value is good."
I went here with four other friends.  I had the lettuce wraps which were pretty good.  One friend did not care for the calamari; she said it didn't have much taste to it. Other comments were that the food was too salty.  But the thing that really bothered us was our waitress.  She brought a bill with everyone's meal on it and we asked for separate bills.  So she got out her calculator and did manual calculations as each person paid and included a decent tip.  I was the last one and I ended up paying for more than my meal even cost.  She said that was the balance remaining which was not true because everyone added a tip. The original bill was less.  So watch out for dishonest servers. I may have given it more stars if it wasn't for the service.
"We came for typically good Chinese food that pleases everyone as well as good service.  The food didn't disappoint, but the service was the worst ever. We come for consistently good food and a fun atmosphere and were so let down and disappointed."
This was my first visit to a PF Changs and I heard so many great things about the restaurant but it was unimpressive.  It was just like eating at a Pei Wei or Mama Fu's.  The price was steeper than what I'd like to pay for the same meal I can get somewhere else.
"We ate at PF Chang's on April 4 after seeing the Jeff Dunham Show at Planet Hollywood.  Our waitress was very attentive and polite.  We had the lettuce wraps as an appetizer.  They were amazing,  My wife ordered Chang's Spicy Chicken.  She enjoyed it but stated that it was not at all spicy.  We are from Texas so we have a high tolerance for spicy food, so many others may think it is spicy.  I ordered the beef with broccoli and it was delicious. We were very satisfied with our dining experience."
Every time in when we are in USA no mater where we visit PF Changs and I must have their Mongolian beef it is beautiful
"I had been looking forward to this meal for months since we booked our trip. I even went so far as to book a reservation a month in advance, and while we had to make changes to the reservation, I always made sure everything was in place. Imagine my disappointment when we arrive to dinner with 11 other people and our reservation no longer exists. The place was packed and while they were able to get us into a private room, it lacked the atmosphere of being with the main restaurant. Unfortunately no one felt the need to apologize for a lost reservation, but rather put the onus on me and quizzing me as to whom I had spoken with. 
After that was sorted out, our food was good and we all had a good time. We didn't feel rushed to leave which is always nice in a busy restaurant.
I would return, but if you make reservations, confirm 6 times because the 5 times I confirmed obviously doesn't assure you a seat."
"Visited twice this trip as we love the food. First visit was fantastic great service & great food.
Second visit we were still eating our starters when the server started to put the plates for the main course on the table, there was 6 of us so the table was pretty full anyway, then our main course arrives while we are still eating our starters. This really annoyed me and asked them to wait! They eventually took away the main meal and said they were making this fresh. This exact same thing happened to us 4 years ago in the same restaurant but we keep coming back as we love the food. We visit P. F Chang's in several locations in the USA but this only seems to happen here!
It won't stop us coming back but I don't understand this kind of rush!"
"My son and I had a late lunch here. Our waiter was awesome! Very attentive. Ordered the crab wontons as appetizer.  So good! Had egg drop soup, fried rice and Mongolian beef. My son had a salad, fried rice and honey chicken. He didn't like the dressing in the salad..not sure what it was. He loved the honey chicken. My entree was great. Only thing I didn't like was that the proportion of beef to rice was not good. Too much of the fried rice. It was delicious but not enough of beef."
Whenever in Vegas my wife and I make it a point to stop at PF Changs.  Best time to go is during happy hour.  Drink prices are very reasonable and the happy hour appetizers are very good.  Service is very friendly and everyone seems to go out of their way to make the experience as positive and pleasant as possible.  We prefer to sit at the bar and visit with the staff.  Always fun people watching.
"Ate at the bar while watching March Madness. Food was okay but not as good as it has been in the past at this same restaurant. I often eat here when I town as it's  easy to get in to and convenient  to most of the hotels on the strip. There wasn't anything bad or not fresh ... it just wasn't great. Overall, seemed more like fast food than I remember from the past."
"I've had to eat at a PF Chang's on business trip before and thus was prepared for a crappy pseudo-Asian chain food restaurant. The food still pseudo-Asian but actually reasonably tasty. I had lobster ""tacos"" for a starter.  While the lobster was fried (was that really lobster) but the ""taco"" shells were actually thinly sliced jicama pieces. A nice touch.  The seared tuna salad was also ok.  The asparagus with spicy sauce wasn't too spicy even though I did ask for it.  I'd call it warm not hot but ok."
"This is a great restaurant not too far off the strip, so you find more locals eating here than tourists.  The food is as great here as any other P.F. Chang's I have eaten at.  They also have an extensive Gluten Free menu.  The crab wontons are superb."
"This place is awesome! Three of us dined, I had lobster fried rice, my pals had chili chicken, we each had a pint and a pear mojo. The bill was $80 bucks! That is hard to beat!! Service was excellent as is the norm around Vegas!"

"Located in Planet Hollywood.  Good for Happy Hour, very reasonable dumplings, lettuce wraps, other apps & beer/wine. It is the same quality you would experience at it's other chains.  Unusual seating as we were seated upstairs and it was quite a trek.  Not my first choice in Vegas, but good if you've never been or looking for HH deals."
"We made a reservation around 1:00 for dinner at 7:00pm. We were seated in the best spot, upstairs overlooking Las Vegas blvd. We enjoyed a beautiful view, delicious food and great service. The lettuce wrap chicken appetizers were so tasty and filling. The Kung pau is always made the same- excellent flavor. Our waitress was so helpful, adding club soda to my drink to give it more flavor and making the tasty hot sauce at our table. PFC is always a winner."
"Always great, I sat at the bar for lunch.  The bartender was very friendly and pretty quick to assist.  I started w won ton soup, it was very good.  I then had orange peel beef.  Again very good, crispy and tangy.  I had hot green tea to drink.
I am glad that it is not in a casino s you can get in and out."
"Located right at the Planet Hollywood Casino, this restaurant is deemed as the busiest of all P.F. Chang's.   We have eaten here at Happy Hour over the years.  Our meals have always been consistent and tasty.

We arrived on Tuesday and had Chang's Ribs and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  We also ordered the Spring Rolls, but felt they were not of our taste.  There are a number of adult beverages at a discount too.

We came back on Thursday and had Chang's Ribs again.  But, this time there were several extra ribs.  I thought, “They gave me a regular order.”  Sure enough, the price jumped from $7 to over $12.  I made mention of this to Rebecca, our delightful bartender.  She apologized for not informing us that Chang's Ribs was taken off the Happy Hour menu Wednesday.  Other items have been added.  I will miss Chang's ribs at Happy Hour prices.

We got to talk to the manager, Mike Focken, and he was more than reasonable of giving us a five dollar credit.  We could tell he is a remarkable manager, having great people skills. He has been with the corporation for 14 years, and I could tell why he was given this opportunity to manage the largest of the P.F. Chang's.

We came back the following Friday to enjoy our last meal before continuing our sojourn.  It is a great restaurant, well operated and the food is mighty tasty."
Late night intoxicated and hungry. To go was great....the tofu lettuce wraps was great the server was great and I got my food in a timely manner
"The PF Chang restaurants are wonderful for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Of course, by the name, it goes without saying that it's an Asian menu including dishes from various origins. All the meals are very tasty and the serves are generous. Some specialty items, such as organic tea.

The service is very friendly and efficient, but these restaurants are very popular so there may be a little wait. Sometimes you are able to do this at the bar. You won't be bored, with a cocktail in hand you'll have the opportunity to enjoy the splendid decor!"
"The sesame chicken was very good.  They had a couple craft beer options including Dogfish Head 60 minute, but not a great variety of craft beer options if your into that.  The mongolian beef was also tasty.  They were able to accomodate gluten free requests which was great.  Food and drinks were quality.  Service was good.  Would defintely return.  Prices seemed to be a good value considering other options on the strip."
we decided to get dinner before seeing Jersey Boys at the Paris theater . So we stopped at PF Chang . The place was nicely decorated and the hostess seated us right way very little wait time. which was very nice. Our waiter greeted and was about to take our drink order . I informed the waiter that  I have certain food allergies and he was very quick to get a special menu that was geared to my specific allergies awesome idea. As we got our drink orders which was a reisling white wine we ordered spring rolls off my my menu which were amazing then onto the main course My husband had shrimp with lobster sauce with brown rice and i tried their shaking beef /with brown rice which was amazing. after our meal if was off to theater to see Jersey Boys. I was so excited to be going to the show that I left my sun glasses at the restaurant. The next day around noon time we went back to PF changs to see about sunglasses and the host there quickly looked in their lost and found box and their they were my sun glasses I would like to thank the staff for a great meal and finding my glasses great time recommend to stop here
"Was visiting Vegas for wife's 50th, couldn't seem to get in for dinner any where, PF Chang was able to accommodate.
 We had never eaten there before and was amazed, food and service was top notch.
 We had one drink error which was corrected immediately and without hassle.
 We will be back next time we visit."
There are many reviews here about this chain so this one will focus specifically on their gluten-free options.  My wife has celiac and this was our first visit to this restaurant.  She enjoyed it so much that we were back again the next day!  Many of their dishes are available in gluten free versions as shown on a dedicated section of their menu. Gluten free soy sauce is also available but you need to request it from your server (the soy sauce on the tables is NOT gluten free). My wife had the lemon chicken for lunch one day and the beef and broccoli for dinner the following night and both were excellent.
"No trip to Vegas for me would be complete without without a visit  here. Myself and 4 friends shared a few plates and a bottle of wine. All very good and for Vegas the wine was excellent value. Must have dishes include the chicken lettuce wraps and the shaking beef. Very special. The service is also spot on and eating at the bar, very relaxing."
This restaurant is based in Planet Hollywood hotel on the strip. Very good atmosphere in the main restaurant. We were placed in a private room with little space and a very sedate atmosphere. Our server was not genuine and quite sarcastic serving our group with no attention given to the birthday guest. The food was delicious and reasonable prices for Vegas. I would go back but make sure you get a table in the main restaurant to enjoy the best atmosphere.
"We were in Las Vegas for a few days celebrating a 40th birthday. It was nice weather, so we saw a PF Chang with outside seating. We knew we could get good food and a decent bottle of wine, so away we headed. It was around 3:00 pm, which is when they start a happy hour. Food was delicious. I had a Shrimp, walnut and melon dish they had on the lunch menu. Delish!!  We also had assorted apps off of HH menu. Everything was delicious, but I must say that Shane, our server was just the best. He made our day!  It's refreshing to see someone that truly enjoys his job. He made our day. We will definitely be back next time we are in Las Vegas. This PF Chang is the one in Planet Hollywood"
"PF Changs is a staple for us and service is always fantastic! The specially made a cucumber martini for me that other tables started to order after asking us what was in my Martini! Or server was awesome too! BUT, the food delivery time is way to slow, a table next to us even left before getting their food."
I would have liked to have tried more things on the menu. Everything was very tasty and the portions were big. This is a really nice Chinese in Vegas
"Have frequented P F Chang's on several occasions and have enjoyed every time.

Happy hour is a great time to eat, for a casual eat I would recommend sitting outside and eating from the top 8 menu so you can try a selection of bites.   It's a great vantage point to watch the world go by in Las Vegas!

For a more formal type dining ask for upstairs, the ambience upstairs is more upmarket.

My favourite was the Dynamite Shrimp and we returned just for that - taste explosion in your mouth!

I would certainly eat at P F Chang's and recommend it without hesitation."
I always enjoy eating at PF Changs. The food is good and the prices are reasonable. Its almost always crowded. Its a very popular place.
This place is great .. The food is always taste fresh and very good size portions. Its got a nice atmosphere and great spot for a date. sit outside and enjoy your meal and do some people watching..
We had a nice dinner outside watching people walk by. The staff were great and the food was good too. The prices were very reasonable. Give this place a shot and you will not be disappointed.
"I'm starting to think that my wife and I stay at Planet Hollywood just to be close to PF Chang's. The food is excellent, well priced and fair sized portions.

We ate there twice on our last visit and if we had more time we would have been back for number three!!"
"Exactly what you would expect from P.F. Chang's. Really good food, fairly priced.  Tuna tar tar was amazing, Yummy!"
I had the Mongolian beef and it was fantastic. My wife had the Crispy Honey Chicken and it was equally delicious. With this said; I believe it is safe to say our favorite course was the lettuce wraps. They we're a very fresh take on a traditional meal. I will get them again on my next visit and there will definitely be another visit!
"We had a tasty appetizer and beer outside in the sun.  Were disappointed the hostess said they had happy hour and when we asked the waiter he said they didn't.  Food was good, we had the pad thai and egg rolls.  Very tasty."
"OK, I was alwasy scared to eat there because I was told it was really expensive. Last thing I need is another expensive crutch...but it was very reasonable especially considering how much they give you and the food is more than worth it!!!! We did the 2 for $44 - we received 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entree's and a dessert. The won ton soup...AMAZING!! Lettuce wraps...I would drive hours to eat those again....mongolian beef and hot and spicy chicken....oh my gosh!!! phenominal....dessert...Tiramisu, my husband doesn't even like this stuff and he coudln't stop eating it!! Like lick your plates good people!!!!"
"We went after arriving in Vegas, desperate for some food. It was pretty good, solid tastes, but nothing mind blowing! We had a prix fix menu, which was a great deal and allowed us to taste a lot if the menu without breaking the bank. Would recommend this option!!!!"
"First time at a P. F. Changs and ordered a couple of appetizers, eggrolls and some low mien. It was much better than I expected."
"We went with a group of people, the food was very good and the portions were adequate. the prices were good too.
We have ate at a PF changes in Hawaii and didn't really enjoy it, but I would go back to this one, it was good."
Went to PF Changs at Planet Hollywood for some sushi and a drink after a long day. Great food and service.
"I had eaten in PF Chang's in San Diego, CA and others, but my wife had not.  So I took her there for dinner.  We found the food to be very good.  We were seated facing a window onto Las Vegas Blvd facing the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio Hotels.  I had told my wife that dinners tend to be on the pricey side, but were pleasantly surprised to find a four-course dinner for two for only $44.95.  The portions were even more than what we had expected and we took our left overs home.  We came in early an were the first to be seated on the upstairs. But when we left, it was full of guests for dinner.  I would recommend P F Chang's for dinner."
"We were looking for something that could cater for a vegetarian and also did sushi so found this and it had good reviews so booked it up for a business meal with two colleagues.  Found the menu we got there didnt have the sushi choice we had seen online but although the service was slow we got some great starters, the vegetarian lettuce wraps were divine with beautiful flavour and my colleague loved her sushi.  The main courses came out when we still had plates of starters left and the waiter had to jig everything around to make it fit, it all came out in stages not together and one noodle dish had been forgotton completely.  I have to say the main wasnt great, the buddhas feast was OK, my colleague had a shrimp dish which looked awful and she said was bland and my noodles when they did arrived were like stodgy spaghetti with no real taste.  Wouldnt go back unfortunately."
"We were for some time in the states and we were desperate to find some food that wasn't American. So, we found this overcrowded place, but the menu and prices were very nice. The people who helped us were very kindly and we have been seated within no time. If you wanted to go to the toilet, you have to walk outside the restaurant, passing a few slot machines and there you have it. I think this is a problem in Las Vegas, so they can't help it. But the toilets are very clean. Food is served like always, very fast and can see that the staff is working really hard. The food is great and they have a real good wine card. I would definitely eat here again if I am in Vegas."
"My wife and I stopped in for an early dinner during happy hour (3pm - 6pm) on Feb. 25, 2015. We had the tuna tartar, spicy tuna roll, spareribs and spring rolls.  Everything was fantastic.  We were seated upstairs overlooking the strip.  We've eaten at PF Changs three times and always have enjoyed the food."
We had a great dinner on the outdoor patio - Louis was our waiter. Excellent service!  There was a prix-fixe type menu and we had that... Will be back next time!
"PF Chang's hardly ever disappoints, and this one was no exception. The service was great the food, Chang's as it always is, reliable.

Nothing great about this place just nothing glaringly bad either."
We had lettuce wraps. These where the best ever!! Hot and sour soup was delis his.  Waiter was very friendly and attentive. Great place over all.
"I've been to Las Vegas twice and the first time I went to LV, we visited P.F. Chang's just about EVERY DAY.  The food there was absolutely fantastic as was the service.  We were very pleased.  We went during the Happy Hour, which also included food, and our entire meal would be Happy Hour appetizers like the lettuce wraps and the spicy shrimp.  The drinks were also fantastic.  We always left stuffed."
"We found this P.F Chang's by accident in Henderson and the service staff there were excellent. The bartender ""Vickie"" was a absolute gem."
"It's a chain restaurant. If you want something very good, but want to play it on this safe side, this is your stop.  Not your typical #1 w/white rice Chinese food.  Creative and tasty dishes."
"One of the great things that comes from staying at Planet Hollywood resort and casino is the wonderful PF Changs restaurant that is literally right off the main casino floor and offers great views of the exciting strip. We stayed a whole week during the Usual Suspects Network (USN) convention last year. My wife and I throughly enjoyed  four delicious dinners at PF Changs. Some high-end chain resturants raise prices and lower the food quality at resort locations thinking most customers are not going to be repeat customers. Not at this location. We found the service staff to be excellent and friendly, the food to be top notch and the prices were completely on par with our favorite PF Changs here in Jax Florida. Outstanding!!! You won't be disappointed. Bon Appetit!"
"Our favorites:  spicy ribs, ginger edamame, and just about any chicken or shrimp dish.  On my last visit I was a little under the weather and noticed chicken noodle soup on the menu.  I ordered it and was pleasantly surprised!  The soup is chock full of chicken strips, rice noodles, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.  Who knew?  Tip:  it's a very large bowl.  If you don't finish it, empty the brown rice ( and anything else) from another meal into the soup and take it home.  It is even better heated up later as leftovers."
The service was excellent.Presentation was great.Cocktail was good value and interesting.The waiter gave me the recipe. The Chicken lettuce wrap was really really good.
"Just go. If you are thinking of going here? Just go. Don't wait, go!
Best value in Las Vegas. Tasty, fresh Asian food that will not leave you feeling gross.
The service has always been good here. We make sure to go once or twice each time we visit Vegas. Try the Walnut & Melon Shrimp."
My father and I were seated quickly and the servers were kind and professional. The scenery was gorgeous and made for a great experience. I ordered the orange chicken which was delicious and the food arrived quickly! No complaints.
"We have visited several PF Change across the country, this was by far the best.  We got to our the hotel early so we decided to eat lunch, and luckily there was a comfortable place after we got off the plane.  The place was huge.  The waitress was probably the best I have ever had, anywhere.  The food was exactly as expected.  What wasn't expected was the low prices.  The same exact prices as everywhere else, no tourist over-charging, fantastic!
It was the best experience I have had at any other PF Changs. A must do."
"Visited after a show and even with almost every table full, the service was prompt, friendly and great.
Food value super - we had their special 2 for $45 - lots to eat and very well presented and tasty.
Our first experience dining at P F Chang's - will be back."
Limited vegetarian options.  Wes not as tasty as back home with bit of Indi taste. But enjoyed the ambience and friendly service.  This restaurant has very good customer response had 15 mins queue.
"Have been to this restaurant numerous times - first time we sat outside on this trip.  Loved sitting outside under the warm heaters - able to watch others on the strip, along with the Bellagio fountains.  The nice thing about sitting outside was that the passers-by could not see in through the mirrored glass.  Food is always awesome there with a few of our favourite dishes being Mongolian beef, curried veggies with tofu, sweet and sour pork....and of course the lettuce wraps!  Actually everything and anything there is great - even better is the no MSG!"
"Visited this restaurant within the Planet Hollywood Hotel, Las Vegas. Quality of food and service was excellent. Was very busy and would be worth looking at booking a table in the busier season."
"We were put in a private room because we had a large party.  With that said, you would think the servers would be attentive. Nope.  Food came out wrong and then when it was fixed it was cold.  I don't know, not a fan.  Salty, mediocre asian fusion."
"In for a group business dinner.

It was very good from start to finish. 

Apps, dinner and service were good. It's not hard to find a good place in Las Vegas."
"Food was good.  Steamed dumplings as an appetizer were good, however, I felt they could have used a little more flavor.  Salads has a nice citrusy dressing but needed salt.  We asked for salt shaker but they did not have any.  We both had the Asian salmon with asparagus and red pepper slaw.  That was good and didn't need salt.  Service was very slow.  I think our waiter was new, so we will give them the benefit of the doubt that it will be better next time."
"We were dining with our best friends here and the atmosphere was excellent and the service was great and the pricing just right.  Have already recommended this restaurant to others.
Even the fussiest diner could eat here as the menu has great choices.
We were a party of six and they sat us upstairs where it was a little quieter so we can visit and linger a bit after our meal.  It was a great experience."
"Just came here for takeout. Venue was quite dark. Ordered the asian grilled salmon $19.95, highly seasoned with salt, did not like it. Combo fried rice  $ 11.50 was average, needed more vegetables.Honey chicken $ 14.00 quite good. Salt and pepper prawns, $ 19.00 good too. Service was quick and great."
"if you want a very good value Chinese restaurant this is the place to eat.

Good menu and good quality food for the money you pay for each dish.

Been to this restaurant a couple of times and always had good service. We went in a large group the last time and the waiter coped really well with the large group."
Service was lackluster and food was fair...Waitress screamed all the time and needs voice modulation lessons. we would not return.
"The food was fantastic and the service was just as good.  Plenty of GF options as well.  This restaurant was so good, we ate here three times.  Totally recommend."
"You can never go wrong with PF Changs.  I went for brunch on a Sunday, and was not disappointed.  In and out within the hour."
"Anytime I am in Las Vegas for a conference, I go here for Dinner at least 2-3 times a week.  The Happy Hour menu is great and the portions are huge.  The Lettuce Wraps and the Tuna Tataki are my favorites, but the sushi is great too!  You can have one of the starters and a great cocktail from the list and get out at $12 plus tip.  In fact, the prices are so low, you can have two of their special cocktails!  The food from the regular menu is great too.  I have had in the past, the Asian Grilled Salmon, the Almond and Cashew Chicken and the Ginger Chicken Breast...all were wonderful and way too much food!  If you are with a group, get a couple of different starters and dinners and share."
"We booked a table for two the evening before and turned up 15 minutes early for our reservation. That wasn't a problem and we were escorted to a lovely window table upstairs overlooking Bellagio's fountains. We started with a vegetarian dumpling and spicy tuna roll both of which were excellent. For mains my wife went with sauteed spicy eggplant while I went with their Chang's chicken. I found my wife's eggplant a little oily but she was happy with it and my chicken was delicious. We had quite a wait between starter and main but the waiter was a little too eager to clear away our mains. Otherwise service was OK and the ambiance in the restaurant was great.
Will definitely visit a PF Changs when opportunity presents."
"My mom booked this restaurant from a recommendation from a friend, what a great surprise! I wasn't sure what to expect, but this place was amazing! I went truckin through Planet Hollywood to the restaurant in my wedding dress and to our lovely private room on the second floor. The food was so good and the restaurant staff were just fantastic. We had our cake delivered here as well form a local bakery, and everything was set up perfect. I still have dreams about those lettuce wraps!!"
"Four of us, two couples, ate there. Each of us got something different than the others. We all loved the taste and how the food was prepared and presented."
This chinese restaurant is really nice! The food is very delicious and the atmosphere is very nice! Every Meals is unique and whatever you choose on the menu everything is good! The service is very friendly and fast!
We visit Vegas often.  We always include Happy Hour at PF Chang's.  We recommend the Lettuce wraps to share or per person - delicious.  Really good service and fast kitchen.
"We had cocktails at the bar before dinner. Amazing service, even though the bar was packed. The happy hour prices in the bar were nice, as everything in Vegas is expensive these days. We did the meal for two special, and were very pleased. Will be back on our next Vegas trip."
"I love Asian cuisine so I frequent P.F. Chang's quite often. Unfortunately, Chang's is a victim of its own success, often being so busy late afternoon onwards that the service suffers. The overall experience is still worth the extra you pay."
"P.F. Chang's is a must for us when we travel to the U.S. and as always, the food was fantastic! The service was great - P.F. Chang's didn't disappoint!"
"Had a great meal with friendly fast service.  My  only complaint was the plastic chop sticks, I prefer wood and the food slides of the plastic too easy.  And special thanks for having Diet Coke and not Pepsi.  As all the others at Planet Hollywood have."
"This review is a shame because I am a fan of PF Chang's.  Unfortunately, the location inside of Planet Hollywood has serious issues.  I've frequented this location many times over the years.  I barely go at all anymore simply because they never get my order correct (I usually order take-out - for the night you need a break and just want to eat in your room).  I've complained although I hate complaining, but it never makes a difference.  Stay away from this place unless you are dining in and do not mind sending your entree back to the kitchen to be corrected."
"Our server Daisy was excellent, she took great care of us, making sure we have enough portion of food to go around for our group with kids. Appetizers were fantastic, we ended up doubling some of the portion like the calamari and the braised seabass due to their popularity with the kids at the table. We didnt have to wait long for food, although, the wait for a table took 30 minutes because we were a big group of 10."
Food was delish as expected.  We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all well presented and very tasty.
My family and I made reservations for NYE a few weeks ago. When we showed up at 8 the place was half empty (never seen this before at this location) but I soon realized why. They had a fixed menu - 5 courses for $65 each.  Nothing special just the usual food that would normally be about 1/2 the price.  Hey no problem if they want to gouge us on NYE but they should warn you before.  I mean where we were going to go at 8pm on the Strip and find another place?  In addition my the food was rushed to our table with all courses served writhin an hour. Brutal.  I saw multiple courses piling up at other tables along with ours.   And not the usual fun atmosphere with many empty tables that remained empty the entire time we were there.  Very disappointing experience.
"My partner and I had been hearing about this places' food for awhile so we made it a point to dine out during our vegas trip.  We were not disappointed, the service was great, the food was just as awesome. Simply put, if your looking for some good food at a good price and quick service then you must eat here while in planet Hollywood."
Great location to people watch located inside Planet Hollywood ask for a window seat or sit outside. Food is good as well as the service great for a early lunch (Lettuce Wraps are the Best) ........ENJOY!!!!!!!!!
"Went here after having a terrible experience at Gordon Ramsay's BurGr restaurant to hopefully redeem our dining experience for the night. Thank you PF Changs for providing just that. The restaurant ran a tight ship and all servers and hostesses inside were competent, friendly and helpful. Our table server made us feel welcome and explained their ""family style""'portions before we dove into their menu. Each of our dishes were cooked thoroughly and tasted great. I'll recommend this place to all demographics of people, friends, family or couples."
"We decided not to pig out in a buffet, and what a great decision it was. All the 4 entrees were delicious, and the lettuce wrapped chicken appetizer is a must. Our server was wonderful, too. I'll come back whenever in Vegas, even though their prices are slightly higher than the menu posted online. Out daughter got a free dessert for her birthday, which we appreciated."
Sooo yummy. It was my first visit and I want more lettuce wraps! We sat at the bar and our bartender was great. We did not interact with any other staff members this visit. The two meals we ate were large and some of the best I have had.
"Our start was off to a good one, with a greeting manager who remembered my name. Then, we sat outside people watching under a nice heat lamp. We started with the Shrimp Appetizer, yummy and slightly spicy. Not enough for me, so I added their signature extra spicy sauce. Our server, Joseph, was professional, friendly, attentive, and motivated about his career and life in the restaurant business. We got just the perfect amount of attention, and many great food suggestions. We love the Kung Pao Scallop. The Beef Szechuan was a nice hearty meal. Although this is not fine dining, what a great place to eat good food at a fair price."
With a group of 18 we were given the upstairs roomus  and 2 waiters they messed up everything Food was average Management stepped in at the end to comp us. But come on if Vegas can't get the service right for a big group who can
"We had a set menu for two, so some different things as to what i would order at our local takeaway, but everything was delicious, and very reasonable priced, we have been to the restaurant a few years ago and could not fault it then either"
Food was very good and was consistent with other PF Changs in Columbus OH and Indianapolis.  I visited this one May 2013
"read about this place on the forum and looked amazing once inside and prices very reasonable on the menu but food and service was very average. No reservation and seated in 15mins. Empty starter plates were not taken from the table and we had to stack them so they could place the mains on the table, Food itself was just very average for all three people and i would not go back"
"Seated straight away at a great table with a view of the strip! We liked that the tables weren't too close together. So often the 2 tables are so close to others you feel like you are dining as a group!
We ordered the $45 meal for 2. We had a cup of each soup (egg drop and hot sour) both were really tasty. Then we had the signature
Chicken lettuce wraps, huge portion and again so tasty, with lettuce replenished as needed. Next course we had crispy honey chicken and Mongolian beef, both wonderful and both came with rice which again is replenished when needed. For desert we shared a salted caramel cake which was delicious! Others had goody bags to take home but we couldn't stop eating so nothing was left. Cocktails were great value at $9 for a large pear mojito! Service was fast and friendly and we did not feel
Rushed!!"
"Not that expensive, and clean and vibrant atmosphere. Foods are a bit overly seasoned, but that's the flavor of American Chinese cuisine."
"There is a PF Chang were I live, but I have never been there yet. Decided to try this place in Vegas! I was absolutely surprised!!! This place is so amazing with their food, that they do not even have salt or pepper on their tables!! And they do not need salt or pepper! This restaurant was really one of the highlights of my trip! I went to Vegas to celebrate my birthday, and I will never forget this restaurant!! Our waiter JUAN was one of the best waiters I have ever encountered in a restaurant! The food is amazing!! The service was amazing!!! Our waiter JUAN was amazing!! WE LOVE PF CHANGS!! Can not wait to go back!!"
"We showed up for my girlfriends birthday dinner with reservations. We received prompt service to our table, but from there it went downhill. The food was good quality but or server was either new or just neglected us. We kept having to ask other servers for service. Drinks went empty constantly and anything we needed took forever to get. On our way out the door, we stopped by the front desk to speak with the manager. I've never dealt with a manage that had as much genuine concern and candor as Mike. He was shocked and invited us back the next day to allow them to make it up to us. We showed the next day and received top notch service and he comped our meal no questions asked. Throughout the meal he took time to come upstairs and check on us. We were very impressed and would go back in a heartbeat."
"This review relates to the PF Chang on the planet Hollywood hotel. The service is friendly and accurate. The food is on the good side of Americanized Chinese and the prices are wallet friendly.
Noise level in the restaurant is quite high, but it's vegas where almost every place is noisy..."
Great value and always good food. Service is also very good considering its almost like a fast food place.
"I came here for the first time with my mom earlier this year. She always talks about PF Chang's whenever we go down to Vegas, but it gets pretty pricey to eat out with our whole fam. Since it was just us this time, we decided to go. It was sooooo good! I was expecting good because of what she had said about it, but it definitely exceeded my expectations! I ordered the orange chicken, which was great, but she ordered the lettuce wraps and let me try it. It was nothing short of amazing! It had so much flavor and is probably one of the best meals I've ever had at a reasonable price. Our waiter was great too. He was very friendly and came a few times throughout our meal to make sure we had everything we needed. He even took a few minutes to talk to us after our meal to see what brought us to Vegas. I can't remember his name, but he had an accent (it was a while ago, so I don't remember exactly where from... Australia maybe?). The inside of the restaurant had dim lighting and had a really cool feel about it. I will definitely be coming to this restaurant again in the future!"
PF's is available as room service when you stay at PH.  It may take an hour to get food through room service but regular items are available quickly.
Both the manager and the waitress went out of their way to accommodate me once they knew I had an allergy to mushrooms. I really appreciated that!
"Ate here a few hours after my best friend's wedding with approximately 20-25 guests. Service was excellent; they made sure we had everything we needed (topping up drinks often and bringing extra lettuce for the lettuce wraps, etc.). Dinner was served family style and it kept on coming! We couldn't finish everything; there was a ton of food (plus wedding cake for afterwards which the bride's mother made--also delicious, of course). The atmosphere was great (we sat upstairs, not in a private area but there was certainly enough room to set up a small table with the cake, etc.). Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to other wedding parties or special occasions; the bride and groom seemed to be happy with their choice to hold the reception here. :)"
P.F.Changs is a very nice place to have a good Chinese meal. If you go during a busy time or weekends you might want to go a bit earlier as it gets very busy and you could have a bit of a wait.
"We went for dinner at the Paradise Road location in Las Vegas in mid November 2014.  The food and the service were both exceptional.  We had the lettuce wraps as appetizer and they are delicious and ample in size.  We had the garlic shrimps, and while good, would not likely have them again.  Salt and pepper shrimp and chicken and broccoli were excellent.  For desert we had the small wantons, that were perfect in size and perfect in presentation and taste.  This location is definitely worth the car or cab ride.  Next time we visit Vegas, this will be on our list of eateries.  Go to their website and take a look at their menu...."
"It was our first visit at this chain and it was an excellent one. It was Thanksgiving day and the wait time was very short. Out waiter was outstanding and did a great job in guiding us through the menu.
The restaurant is directly on the Strip and for that it is below average prices. Definitely worth a visit."
"We just went for drinks and I must say the bartender was excellent I usually drink old-fashioned and this guy made me one of the best old-fashioned I have ever had ,he was very attentive and kept bringing us wonton strips to snack on , we had a couple drinks and left...next time we're in Vegas will come see you"
"The food has so much grease, that you don't even have to chew your food.  The flavors were ok, but I have tasted better."
Either way be prepared to have a lot of hot fresh food served to you.  We opted for the cheaper entree and still had food left over.   Service was perfect and we couldn't have been happier.
"We've been to a PF Chang's before - but never with service this great!  We enjoyed the variety of cocktails offered - choosing the Lemon and Coconut Sour and the Ginger Mojito.  Yum!  The lettuce wraps came with minimal lettuce, but we were reassured by the busboy, ""If you want more lettuce, just ask your server.""  We didn't have to!  Jeremy, our server came by to check and said, ""You need more lettuce."" and promptly returned with it - not once, but twice, as he realized we were wrapping our tasty lunch specials in lettuce, too!  The mongolian beef and kung pao chicken were an awesome combination.  I skipped the eggdrop soup course knowing food was plentiful, but my companion loved it.  Not only was there very nice variety for lunch specials, the food was tasty and well priced.  AND we had a super table on the patio to people watch as the afternoon unfolded.  It was nice not to be rushed."
I love chinese food.  I could not wait to try this place out at PH.  I was not impressed by the food and found it to be very salty.  The service however was fantastic.
"We had planned to come here at least once this trip.  May was the first time we ate here and the food was amazing.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wrote in my last review that our waiter was ""overly"" attentive.  Looks like they got THAT problem straightened out.

We wanted to sit on the patio for lunch the day we arrived.  Great, no wait, straight to a table.  Waiter took our drink order and then....disappeared.  Literally.  At one point a waitress had come by and asked if we needed drinks, but we told her that someone already taken our order.  Waited for at least another 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us again (we were in the corner where the 'smokers' gate was, so didn't have a lot of server traffic).  So, we figured we'd order drinks again since we didn't expect that our original ones would come.  Which they didn't.  When the 2nd waitress finally brought our drinks (this was about a half hour after we gave our original order: 1 beer + 1 red wine + 1 white wine = not difficult), she told us that our waiter left.  Nice. We were like ""he left?!"" and then she stammered and said it was a family emergency.  Not buying it.  

In any case, my friend and I split the lettuce wraps, the crispy green beans and the california roll - all awesome.  We did come back again for dinner and sat in the restaurant and the service was 'better'.  Except there was quite a wait for the food, and we ordered a california roll for an appetizer - however when our meals came out, it hadn't yet arrived.  The crispy honey chicken was decent and 2 other friends had salads which they said were good.  Based on the other reviews I have read, in addition to my experience, something needs to be done about the service here."
"I met some great people at the bar, the food and drinks were great, and I even received a complimentary appetizer."
Always excellent food. Get the lettuce wraps they are superb. Great location on the strip. See if you can a first floor table with a view.
"I've invented an invisibility formula. Sort of. 

From now on whenever I don't want to be seen or talked to I'm going to go to the P. F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood in Vegas. My wife and I were shown to a table fairly quickly, which was good. But I was convinced that we were going to witness the second coming of Christ before a server approached our table. This was bad. We had just been book shopping before coming in here and I was thinking that maybe I had time to read my new book before we were waited on. I could have written one.

A waiter, suddenly remembering that he had a job, finally came to our table and thanked us for our patience. There was no apology offered for our wait. Just an 'Atta boy' for hanging in there. He asked if he could start us off with some drinks but since we already had an eon to stare at the menu we were able to give our full order right away. I ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken because there's nothing like sweet & spicy chili sauce when you're feeling ill-tempered. I didn't even bother to take a picture of my food to go along with this review. So if you've never seen what spicy chicken looks like - or a bottle of Budweiser, than I'm sorry to disappoint. But whenever I can't give you a picture - I WILL give you a thousand words.

Everything started to proceed somewhat swimmingly from here -  and 'swimmingly' isn't a word I use very often so that's a testament to how much better things really were going. We got our food pretty quickly and it was good. The waiter even came by asking if he could get me another beer. He was probably trying to get me drunk in hopes that it would increase his chances of getting a decent tip (didn't happen).

Then the invisibility formula kicked in again and we could no longer be seen or heard for another extended period of time. My wife asked if I wanted to get dessert but I was worried that might take another eight hours. I just wanted to pay the bill (or the 'check' as Americans so charmingly call it) and get out. We were finally able to get the waiter's attention and hand him our credit card. He disappeared without a trace for about ten minutes or so. I was starting to think that they truly didn't want us to leave. This must be how Henley and Frey felt when they wrote ""Hotel California."" And Don Felder too. A staff member eventually approached us and said that their credit card machine was down and that they were waiting for it to come back online. Later on it did. And we left - never to return.

""Hotel California"" has always been a work of mystery with no one truly knowing what the lyrics are really about. I do. Me, P. F. Chang, and I suspect - H. G. Wells. Along with Henley and Frey, of course. And Don Felder too."
Food and service was great. After a long day of traveling we decided to eat here and it was worth it. Will be back soon
Have eaten at many Chang's around the country and true to form the service and food was terrific.  Always a good deal.  Dinner for the 6 of us with tip and few glasses of wine was $280.  Highly recommend.
"I cant say enough about this place. Always an amazing meal. Their famous $44 meal for 2 is just fantastic value. MORE than enough food, and delicious every time. Staff are great, food is great and a good atmosphere to boot . TOP RATED !"
"Loved it !! Lettuce wraps to start followed by the set meal for 2. The Mongolian beef was outstanding, the chicken was also awesome but I much preferred the beef, huge portions of very tasty food & a couple of drinks for the great price of $60 inc tips. Definitely be back."
There was nothing that we disliked. The food and atmosphere were wonderful. We were there for an early dinner and got right in. It has a great location - right on the heart of the strip.
"This place is always good, mid ranged priced, never dissapointed. Planet Hollywood is good too. Lounge Rocks and Gordan Ramsey Burger is there to. Always fun people at the Bar, do that before sitting at a table. Service is always good."
"Certainly the best meal we had during 9 nights in Vegas, we tried some hotel restaurants where the bill was more than double, the set meal for two is great value, the staff were excellent we were seated in exactly the wait time advised and were given sound advice by the servers. The food is nicely spiced and very tasty and well priced, also drinks were good."
"Located on Las Vegas Blvd. What a great location. Seated fast.  Aaron, the server,did and outstanding job.  The food he said was outstanding, was! Food came out hot and tasted excellent. Will go back! Go early a beat the rush."
"My wife and I went to a P.F. Chang's in Las Vegas... looking for a Chinese dinner.
The hybrid dishes offered may please some, but we were greatly disappointed.
If you are looking for genuine Asian cuisine, don't visit this place!"
"We booked. We were promptly seated at a private booth upstairs. Our waiter, Brian, was superb. Charming, chatty, funny, and helpful. Between five adults we went for 2 x Changs 'Menu for Two' and added a couple of sides. There was more than enough choice, and more than enough food. The service was slick and everyone enjoyed the meal. UK 'mainstream' chinese restaurant food can be quite sugary, but this chain restaurant's dishes were pleasantly varied and quite spicy - a really welcome change. This is not gourmet chinese cooking (I have had better meals in Beijing and Hong Kong) but its pretty good and, considering the location, the bill wasn't too bad either. If you fancy a 'Chinese' in Vegas tonight, this would be a good choice."
"The service was excellent and the food was steaming hot and delicious, and the price very reasonable and the portion is generous."
PF Chang is a great place to eat. We don't have one of these restaurants back home so we always make a point of eating here at least once on each trip. Great Asian food.
"Would recommend eating here, as you can sit outside on the pavement.  The food is very good, Chinese food, the waiters/waitresses are friendly and helpful and you can watch the street entertainment from your seat.  The Mongolian beef is good."
"well worth a visit, a modern twist on classic Chinese food.Id book a table in advance if you want to eat here or you may be sat at the bar for a while"
Really liked the food and the location too. Take an outside table and you will enjoy the strip & fountains of Bellagio. The Tofu curry is good. A Must for Chinese cuisine.
"It's a Chinese food chain....what can you really expect?  Well, certainly didn't expect it to be as good as it was. We tried the lettuce wraps, the Cali roll, wonton soup...just for starters. I also had the shrimp with lobster sauce.....very impressed. Service was above average too. I will definitely go again."
"We were given our own private booth as it was a special occasion. Service was great! The waiter was very polite and sociable. Cocktails and food were fantastic. 
It is genuinely one of the best Chinese meals I have had. 
If only there was one closer to me!"
Went here for supper for our last night in Vegas.  The food was excellent.  It was very fresh with lots of flavour.  The service was friendly and relatively fast for how busy it was.  It gets pretty busy on a Saturday so go a bit early if you want to avoid a wait.  It is a bit loud in there when the restaurant is full.
This was my 1st time in Las Vegas. Strip House restaurant prices are very high. We love PF Changs !!!!
"I have to say, these great people know how to handle a mistake! I have a shellfish allergy and I ordered a bowl of Lo Mein (I know the lo Mein contains oyster juice, but it's never bothered me.) I some how found what seemed to be a peice of shrimp. As a person who doesn't eat seafood often, I questioned it and asked my waiter. He brought the manager and she was so helpful and apologized and wanted to take the meal off and get me a free dessert! She even went out of her way to get me some allergy medicine! I didn't have a really bad reaction, just a mild one since I didn't eat the shrimp. They also made me a new entree! I enjoyed the service, peope and food! This location was certainly the best I have been to! Will visit again!!"
"We stop at this P.F. Changs whenever we are in Vegas, as it is right on the strip in Planet Hollywood. The food is great but sadly we always order the same food, dumplings and Mongolian Beef. We always sit at the bar as it is quicker than waiting for a table. The service is a little better than average, but that is understandable as they are so busy. It can get pricey so be prepared"
"Very enjoyable meal and right on the strip.  We had lunch outside on the patio and people watched.  The crispy bean appetizer is a must and the Mongolian Beef was excellent.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and offered suggestions on entrees and sauces.  I will be sure to visit here next time I'm in Vegas.  It wasn't to busy at lunch but last time I was here for dinner they were very busy, so I'd recommend making a reservation for dinner."
"MUST HAVE EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GO!! without fail, delicious food, great quality and superb service. LOVE PF CHANGS!"
"The first place we dined at when arriving in LV mid october and absolutely loved it!
 
The minute we walked in we were greeted by their friendly staff and chose the option to sit up stairs. Our waiter was lovely and informed us it was happy hour with their selected entree menu so we opted to choose pretty much every dish on the happy hour menu and share it between the 3 of us.
 
Our drinks and food arrived within perfect timing as we were starving! I’ve never had such great tasting asian food, it really was amazing and my favourite was the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Lots of flavour and really fresh, I wanted to order more but at this point we still had more food coming.
 
Efficient service, friendly staff and would dine there again."
"Good location, enjoyed eating on the deck.  Ok service, normal PFChangs experience.  Opened Sunday at 11am."
"We got to P.F. changes really close to closing, staff was very friendly. Our waiter was efficient and friendly, food was great!"
"Ordered the shrimp with lo mein noodles. It was good, but so salty! It also made me sick for two days with stomach problems.
Nice to watch the people go by and the view though."
"Loved the food and the service.  Thank you Robyn for being helpful, funny and making out dinner out such a great time.  Had the Korean BBQ, Mongolian Beef, Lettuce wraps, DanDan Noodles and California Roll - everything was fresh and delicious."
Took my brother forever to get his soup and a long time for our food.  Refills were very slow.  We didn't even get plates for our food.  We had to eat off the serving dish.  Had to squeeze the rive one the serving dish.  Yes they were busy but service was bad.  Probably understaffed.  We noticed a few other tables that were having slow service.  Some even got free appetizers.
"We were actually heading to another restaurant for lunch when we decided to detour into P.F. Chang's.  I'm very glad that we did because we had an excellent lunch.  Our server was pleasant, efficient and recommended food and drink items to us. The food was expertly prepared and the wait was minimal.  I'd highly recommend this P.F. Chang's location again."
"I ate alone. was placed at a table a few feet from a noisy drink station even though the restaurant was less than half full, loud wait staff didn't seem to notice how disruptive they were. Just so-so food and service."
"We saw PF Chang's while walking the Strip. It was not our first experience with PF Chang's but it was a first in this location. The service was nice, the menu is always good, even enough items to choose from for my vegetarian friend."
"Food here is always consistent, tasty and priced well! There is a dinner for two option, but it will feed three or four people, love the spicy green beans and Chang's spicy chicken!"
"It's a place to go in couples, family, or groups.
People  are really willing to help you hace a great time and waiters really know their menu, they are a lot of help when you have to decide what to have."
"I came to P.F. Chang's with a group of ladies for a bachelorette night.  They took us upstairs, where we could be seated together at one big table.   Our server was very upbeat and friendly, as were all the folks working there.  They definitely understood we were having a party and helped create a fun atmosphere for us.  They even bought a free piece of cheesecake for the bachelorette.   

That said, the food was just so-so.  I had pad Thai, which was too sweet, not very authentic in my experience.  It was ok, though.  The bachelorette sent her food back because she didn't like it at all (maybe that's why they gave her the free cheesecake?).  I did taste one excellent item on the menu from another friend's plate.  (I think it was shrimp with candied walnuts.  Described on the menu as ""tender shrimp tossed in a creamy sauce with candied walnuts and honeydew melon."")  In short, the food ran the gamut from inedible, to so-so, to very good.  

Considering the size of our group, we received fairly good service.  The only snag was the fact that we had asked for several different bills.  They said they could accommodate that, but virtually everyone's tab had some mistake.  Some of us bothered to correct it, others didn't.  Just watch your bill carefully.

PF Chang's at Planet Hollywood gets lots of points for a fun, party atmosphere.  The food and service just could have been better."
"As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and felt welcome!  We chose to sit outside to watch people walk by on the Vegas strip!  Our server was so friendly and helpful with our ordering, as it was our first time there.  The food came and was exactly as our server told us when he helped us order.  A very good experience----we will go back!"
"Celebrated my brother's birthday for dinner.  Tried a new dish, DanDan Noodles on the 2 for menu and it was great.  Never a disappointment with anything ordered.  

My brother's first time and he can't wait to find one in Arizona so he can go again!"
"There are 2 P.F. Chang locations within close proximity. Our family had dinner at the one on Paradise (a few blocks East of the Strip) & Flamingo. The food and service were great. I have eaten at other Chang's and have found the food to be consistently good. The only drawback to the Paradise location is the neighborhood -not the best. Had it not been for the transient wanting to clean my car windows when we were leaving, I would give this place 5 stars. All in all, lovely dining experience."
"As always at a P.F. Chang's, things went like clockwork. All the dishes our group tried were very tasty. We noticed zero quality issues and would highly recommend this to those looking for a pleasant eating experience on the Strip."
Prices are reasonable and food choice was good. However when the meals arrived they were quite bland and the chicken that I had was very chewy. I am not sure if I would visit here again.
"Sorry to say we have not been to PFC before which after this meal is our loss! We arrived having reserved our table a little early and were told our table would be ready within ten minutes, however just five minutes later we were called and were sitting at our table bang on time, this despite the restaurant being totally full. Our server soon brought our drinks and took our order promptly and after a reasonable wait our starters arrived,  minced chicken wraps and prawn Dim Sum, both were beautiful to eat and presented well, our main courses of Orange Peel Shrimp and Lemon Chicken arrived after a little wait which was appreciated. Again both dishes were superb and our server kept us supplied with ice water on a regular basis and was very attentive. This meal really was a class act, well cooked and seasoned and backed up with great attentive service whilst the restaurant was under great pressure, we will go again soon and can thoroughly recommend this place to everyone"
"During a week stay in Las Vegas, we found this restaurant at the Planet Hollywood location and revisited a couple of times.  The outdoor seating is perfect and the food is excellent and consistent.  Beverages were outstanding and a great value.  We highly recommend this as a great place for an excellent meal a relaxing venue to watch the action on the strip."
"Rarely dissapointed by a PF, normally know where you stand. this is no exception. 
in a place that is all about vibrancy this restraunt fits in except for it delivers it with a little bit of class. good food,good service."
"We sat outside on the strip for dinner such that you could see the Belagio fountains across the street. Food was great, but the portions are too large! Price was reasonable even for the alcohol."
fantastic service .food was average but where you are makes up for it.go for the set meal .very good value
"This was my second time to this location. It was about a 30 minute wait for a table so we ate at the bar. 

Someone else mentioned it here that it seems like a lot of the service people in Vegas appear to be ""over it"". I can see why that would happen but why keep working at a job you clearly don't like, or are just enduring?

Anyhow, our food was great and came fairly quickly, which is good because we were both really hungry. My only ""beef"" would be that my vegetarian dish could have used some more vegetables in it. 

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be back!"
"It might be a chain restaurant, but this particular PF Chang's was the best I ever went to.  The food was excellent and prepared perfectly.  Good service and reasonable prices.  Fun location right in the middle of the strip near The Paris hotel."
"We stayed the Planet Hollywood with friends who had eaten at PF Changs before. They spoke very highly of it, and was one of their favourite restaurants. We joined them for one meal here and absolutely loved it, we were immediately hooked on PF Changs. Best Chinese meal we've ever had. We have also since ate at their Orlando restaurant and are headed back to Vegas next month, and this is a must."
"We ate at P.F. Chang's for the first time since discovering my husband and son had Celiac Disease 4 years ago.  The server was very knowledgeable.  Told us all gluten free food, with the exception of the flourless chocolate cake, is served on round plates with P.F. Chang's name on them.  Said we should question a server if our gluten free food was ever served on a regular plate.  Service was great, food was great.  We will return."
"You can get a bottle of Columbia Crest Chardonnay for 21.00 and the food is all reasonable and good. The Lemon Chicken Salad was great yesterday and the garlic spinach side dish was excellent. There is outdoor seating but can be windy or not in the shade but yesterday it was ok. 
We eat here a few times whenever we are in Vegas. Convenient location right in Planet Hollywood right in the front."
"Have eaten in many P F Changs and I love the consistency of the food, I nearly always order the same thing. Kung Pau Chicken I would have given it 5 stars except the staff were surly and they brought our food in the wrong order.
Our server I joked with and asked him to smile as he looked surly, eventually he dI, there was one large girl with blond hair in a ponytail who just looked plain mean, a huge scowl on her face the entire time. Service was Ok except they forgot our salad and soup so the main course arrived, he asked if we wanted it left on the table whilst he got the rest of our appetisers...no we want it hot, so as a result it was kind of dry and not hot and fresh as it should have been. All of the servers looked a little fed up and not happy to be there. That's Vegas I guess!"
The service was quick and the food was good. We would return and eat there again. Be sure to make reservations the place is very busy even during the week
"Took my wife here on her birthday and the service was great. They got us rite in without a reservation, the waiter was great and I can't say enough about the food"
"We've dined there on our last 5 visits, in as many years, to Las Vegas. The food selection was extensive and delicious. Love it. Long may it survive."
"Each time I visit the USA, a trip to Changs is a must! We've eaten here in California, Orlando and Seattle and its been great every time and Las Vegas was no exception.

There was a slight hitch however in Vegas. 1of our party of 11 had the foresight to book ahead given the size of the party wanting to eat here on a Friday night prior to the Britney concert. When we arrived it was apparent that the manager who had taken the  booking had got it wrong in that he'd booked us in for the following night. Rather than turning us away, the assistant manager came up trumps by offering us a private dining room with complimentary appetizers! What a result and l can't thank the staff enough for a memorable experience."
"It doesn't matter whick PF Chang's you visit, the food and service is always very good.  The one thing we did notice was that the prices are a little bit higher at this location."
"As with the other PF Chang's the star here is the food. Absolutely delicious! My favorite: walnut shrimps, and again it was awesome. No problems with service at all, except for the hostess who maybe just had a bad day. But, all in all, very good experience!"
"Even though P.F. Chang's is a chain restaurant, my husband had never eaten at one so we gave it a try in Vegas.  We had a short wait at dinner time, but were seated in the time frame the hostess told us.  Since we couldn't decide, we did a four course pick for two for a reasonable $39.95!  We each had a soup (both good) and then shared Mongolian Beef and Spicy Chicken.  The best part of the meal for me was the dessert.  One of the best tiramisu I ever ate... delish.  So if you are looking for Chinese food in Vegas, you can't miss on this one."
"We had diner at PF , the food is like always good quick and averidge  i was impressed by the tempo they put on , location wise they have to fill 'll the tables at least 4 times. Night and there is where it's goes wrong , we get something else than ordered but we did'nt complaine because otherwise we had to wait for 10 to complete the order , so if you want a relaxed diner in Vegas at Chang's go two blocks down on flamingos to the right , everything is relaxed out there and you can enjoy your diner in peace !!"
"This was the first place we visited after our arrival to Vegas. We ordered the lettuce wraps, spring rolls, and a desert trio. It was just as it is at home for me, something to eat in a pinch."
"Visited whilst in Vegas on business with a colleague. We sat upstairs as the restaurant was very busy. We has ribs and prawns to start. Both were only luke warm and did not arrive together. The ribs were very nice and the prawns ok. Mains of special fried rice, a spicy chicken and a black bean beef were all fairly good but again only luke warm.
I would probably go back a second time."
"We loved this place. Service was fantastic, food was well priced and most importantly tasty. The decor boasts modern lighting features with dark wood compliments. A nice place to eat for couples, families or a group of girlfriends. The bar here would also be a nice place to have a chilled drink or two. We will be back"
"We came here for dinner recently and had a perfectly decent meal, but I didn't feel like I had had a ""full-on"" Chinese meal experience.  It is a large restaurant, and on the night we visited was not full, so was somewhat lacking in atmosphere, not helped by various staff doing cleaning, emptying bins, etc, whilst we were eating.

A starter of crab wonton was good - very crisp wonton filled with crab paste rather that discernible crab flesh.  A main of salmon was fine, but really offered nothing oriental in its seasoning; the day was saved by the other main of spicy tofu, which was delicious.

Service was attentive and overall the meal was good, but there was some indefinable magic missing."
"Every visit to PF Changs has been consistant, it doesn't matter what city. You know what to expext with no surprises."
It was a four way decision to eat here after being at a show at this hotel and we were all  looking forward to a good meal and a few drinks to end the night. We ordered a selection of starters to share and did the same with the mains. As expected the food was excellent but unfortunately the guy who served us was truly awful. He looked bored and fed up any time he came anywhere near us and  when my daughters partner couldn't make up his mind in a split second in his choice of drink he actually rolled his eyes and tutted. Not once from beginning to end did he smile. I can honestly say I've never had worse service anywhere. At one point I was so annoyed I said to my daughter that there was no way I was leaving a tip to reward bad behaviour. I'm pretty sure he heard as he was walking past the table at the time but too bad! My daughters partner said regardless he would leave a small tip so when we got the bill he gave him notes which left about $4 change which he planned on making up to $10 but when the server came back with the change he literally threw it onto the table so he got nothing. Hopefully he won't be employed there for too much longer as we would definitely go back for the food but if he was there we would go elsewhere. This is what has reduced my score from what would have been a 5. Shame really but no excuse for that kind of non service.
"Our second visit to PF Changs was as good as our first, but maybe made a bit better by the fact that we had one of their special Gin and Tonic creations....wow, it was excellent!

The lettuce wraps....really, does anyone need to say anything else?  Still the best appetizer hands down.  Yes, a bit of a pain to eat, but in reality less challenging than somethings like lobster etc.  And...it's so worth the effort!

Husband had the salt and pepper prawns which he quite enjoyed although they are a bit on the hot and spicy side of life.  I had the spiced chicken and it was delicious.

All in all a VERY good meal and we'd highly recommend it for anyone looking for some good flavour profiles on the strip."
My first time to try this restaurant and I was never disappointed. Service was very good. The server was nice and friendly. Great atmosphere. Overall very good.  Food was lovely and worth the money you pay for. Will visit this restaurant again. I can eat here everyday.
"We always have at least one meal here, doesn't seem to matter how busy it is, service is very good.   They have a great menu and choosing is the most difficult thing there!  We found it better to eat outside on their terrace because the air conditioning inside was high enough to cool our food and it is nice to sit outside in the warm night air."
"I have never gad a bad meal here. I frequent this place often. They have great lunch menu for 8.95 
Dinners more pricey.
 It's always busy. Some of my favorites are lettuce wraps, shrimp with lobster sauce, honey shrimp
Consistently good. Always busy."
You can't beat the food here and the service. We always come back when we are in Vegas. Located in Planet Hollywood.
Excellent food and service.  Attended a wedding celebration dinner and food was very good.  Service was great and staff were very friendly.  Restaurant was extremely busy but service was still good.  Went a second time just to enjoy a good meal and was equally satisfied.  Priced reasonably and would recommend it as a great place to go.
"We visited this restaurant I planet Hollywood great meal, free rice fantastic, excellent service and friendly staff"
"PF Changs is a restaurant we visit each time we come to Vegas. The strip location is very busy so if you have a rental car there are other locations in Vegas that are not as busy. The other locations we tried maintain consistent quality. The food is nicely presented, tasty and enjoyable. One plate per person is a good way to judge how much food to order. The food is very good at a reasonable price."
"Good fusion food but the lettuce wraps were painful. I make cabbage rolls and I know that you need a little more lettuce to be able to wrap things up. No, that wasn't the case. Sticky ribs and Sechuan chicken were good but I think I was on overload by then..."
"We visited this restaurant I planet Hollywood great meal, free rice fantastic, excellent service and friendly staff"
"Live in Las Vegas but have never been to PF Chang's before. Ended up here for a my birthday dinner since line at burGR was too long. It was a great choice!  The food was great and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Lively but not overly loud. Our waiter, Curtis, had an awesome personality and provided excellent service.  I could have eaten the dumplings appetizer as a meal. Cost was reasonable with 2 entrees, appetizer, beer and soda coming to only $54. All in all, glad the line was too long and we ended up with a good meal with exceptional service! Thanks Curtis!"
"My husband and I ate here two times during our visit to Las Vegas.

The first night we ordered the sticky spare ribs to start, which were good.  For mains, my husband ordered the kung pao scallops and I ordered the lettuce wraps.  For how much people rave about the lettuce wraps, I was a little let down and thought they were just okay.

The second night we ate here we ordered the egg rolls to start, which we liked.  For mains, my husband ordered the shrimp pad thai and I ordered the sesame chicken.  We both really enjoyed our mains.  I also ordered the red sangria, again due to rave reviews, but it was literally straight alcohol and a little too strong for me – especially compared to the sangria I get at home!

All in all, I would return to PF Changs.  They have a very large menu and the service was good on both visits."
"sign up for emails, they have bogo sometimes, this is when we go. Great customer service & good fresh food."
"This was a return visit to P F Changs at planet hollywood for me as I had been travelling the states with a friend and we visited whilst in Vegas and I just had to come again!! My boyfriend and I went to eat there twice in our recent visit and it did not disappoint! The food was amazing and the servers were really friendly both times! One of the night we came there was a wait on tables and we took a buzzer and went in to the casino for a drink. we were told a 25 minute wait and were buzzed after 10! Not bad at all!
As soon as you walk in you get bombarded by the beautiful smell and the dishes that are available are different to the dishes you would get at home and all taste amazing! The Mongolian beef is what I came back for and it was as amazing as ever!!! you need to try it!! 
A full gluten free menu is provided and the set menu for two is amazingly good value! 
If you sit by the window you can watch people go by the strip and some of the Bellagio fountains! Definitely worth a visit!"
"We were here on a Friday, 8 of us
no problem getting reservation,
Service was excellent, food was VERY good, they suggested several dishes, all good
Our table was Filled with plates of food, the Lettuce wraps are so good, we could not even finish it all
We had beers, wine and left stuffed for $60 per couple
Really - this place is the BEST"
"My wife and I favorite restaurant in Las Vegas is PF Changs. The location, get a patio table if weather permits. The food is great and the view of the strip and all the interesting people walking by is great. Located in Planet Hollywood, you can gamble while waiting for a table if they are busy."
OMG I love this place. Having eaten here 5 years ago when I was last in Vegas it was the one place I was definitely going back to this time. I would have to say one of the best Chinese meals I have ever had and cannot wait till I return to the States next year. The staff were friendly and the service was spot on. Big portion sizes which was not off putting as the food was delicious. If you go here you will not be disappointed.
Love the food at PF Changs! Every one i visit is consistent. Considering the location of this one - you would think that they may be slow with their service - that was not the case!
"P.F. Changs is a chain. Their food is anything but ""real: Chinese. In addition they are over priced.
If you want good Chinese food, visit Las Vegas's Chinatown. On Spring Mountain, west of Las Vegas Blvd (The Strip)
I am a resident of Las Vegas"
"Whenever we come to Vegas we do PF Changs. As always we had great service and a great meal. If you like Asian food, you'll love this place. You don't have to break the bank to eat here; unlike some of the other Asian centric food places that are way pricey in Vegas. If you're near Planet Hollywood give PF Chang a try."
"It's so hard to find pricing that isn't inflated in Vegas. I've been to many PF Changs and loved it. This one had the same delicious food, good service, and regular pricing. It was nice to find somewhere to eat inside Planet Hollywood without having to pay an arm and a leg."
"a) I like PF Chang's, so this is a bit biased.  Sat at the bar as i was by myself.  Service was normal for eating at the bar - meaning more attention than at a table.  Food was relatively fast - had lettuce wraps and Chang's Spicy Chicken.  Both as expected, but don't expect the waiter to mix the sauces for you at the bar.  Chicken has always been very tender -this was no exception.  A nice meal as usual."
"The food here is not worth the cost! The noise level is out of control too! When I spend money like that, I expect more than they offer!
I used to like Moo Shut Pork, but it's been eliminated!"
"Very good food, delightful rice, and chicken, then to be in one of the funniest hotels in las vegas is cool, to get out and play some dolars in the slots machines.
The food is very good, is a nice restaurant, you have to love P.F. Chang!"
went on my last day in vegas for lunch wish i had of went on my 1st day so i could have went back to try more dishes. the soup was amazing to start as was the  ribs and the  garlic chicken so looking forward to getting back next year and really reasonable prices compared to most places to eat on the strip
"I thought that a Chinese Restaurant chain would not work in my world of great food, service and wine - but alas I was proven incorrect.
Great time, value and Food !"
"Last year we went to PF Changs twice as we'd had such a good experience the first time. The second visit wasn't quite as good as the first, and the service lacked a bit.

This year we decided to give it another go and unfortunately it's continued downhill. 

Service was terrible. We were given a buzzer to let us know when our table would be ready. After waiting an hour in the casino it still hadn't buzzed. We went back and were told 'Oh yes .. you've been waiting a while haven't you?'. Yes we have!! They gave us a teensy table crammed in between countless other teensy tables on the noisy main floor. Our waiter came and gave us menus and took our drinks orders. I asked for a Cranberry juice and when it came it was lukewarm and had no ice in it. He seemed to notice after he placed it on the table and said 'Oh, shall I bring ice?' but I just took some ice from my water for it. This was the beginning of our terrible service experience.

We ordered their speciality - the lettuce wraps - and as before they were delicious. One reason to come here! I also ordered the green beans and some dim sum. 

They do a special sauce selection which you can mix and match depending on your taste - sour/spicy/salty etc. On our first visit our server went through all the dishes and explained the sauces - this time our server couldn't get away from us quickly enough and barely acknowledged our existence. It's a good job I remembered from last year about the sauces!

The main courses were ordered and finally came - and were okay. Usual fare but to be honest I was a bit disappointed. It was pretty average - I've had similar at Panda Express! I'd finished my drink and he never came near to ask if we wanted another. I had to drink my husband's iced water. 

We were finished and ready to leave so we asked for the check. Instead of simply going and getting it, our server started taking orders from two large groups who had been seated on either side of us. He then left - and to my amazement returned with their drinks orders - but not our check!!! It was around 15 minutes at least before he finally returned with the bill - by which time we were thoroughly fed up. We certainly didn't tip high and it's doubtful we'll go here again. There are plenty of options for Chinese food in Vegas and this is no longer on our list. Shame."
"We went here as a large group of about 40 people. We were seated upstairs in a few different tables and it worked out very well. The service was great, drinks and wine were timely. We had a set menu for our group and everything kept coming out and we had plenty of food. The food was all very tasty as well.All in all a great experience"
"The heat, endless walking and noise of the Strip gets to be a bit much and P.F. Chang's is a cool, quiet respite with good service and less grease than the other options in the area."
We found items on the menu that are not in the menu at other properties elsewhere.  Our service was very good and food excellent.  Attention to detail was outstanding!
"Dame as any chain of restaurants. Part of traveling to Vegas are the shows and magnificent restaurants you now find I'm hotels all around the strip. Why bother with this one when so many truly magnificent restaurants can be found here. 

Lists of great restaurants making this one, one of the ""bunch"". 

Don't bother."
I went there for a quick lunch at the bar and left satisfied.  The food was good but not great.  For lunch it's fine but  I wouldn't recommend it for dinner though -- there are better places in Las Vegas to spend your pennies at.  I also found the bartender a bit standoffish and strange.  He didn't make me feel very welcomed.
"have eaten here in Boston, and dragged the family here in Las Vegas.  Poor service, food not great (we had eaten the night before in Chin Chin in New York New York, which was fab!!) Felt as if we were on a conveyor belt, waiter unfriendly, crammed in - and we were charged for the table next to us's drinks ... shame."
Friendly wait staff.  Prompt even though it was busy.  Food was good and nicely presented.  Waiter was a little too opinionated on what he liked and didn't like.  Overall good experience.
"We turned up in a group of 3 thus leaving a spare seat for Mr Chang, unfortunatly he didnt turn up, which was a slight dissapointment, i asked the waiter and she confirmed he would be attending. so not sure what happened there?

neverless the food was spot on, highly reccomended!!"
"Great food - just like the best PF Chang's food you have had at any of their other restaurants.
We had a large group, over 15 so we got the special/private room.

Fantastic service & experience."
Very busy restaurant with buzzing atmosphere. Food was okay but nothing special really. Service was a bit hit and miss. Won't make a special trip to return.
"I love everything I have ever tasted at P.F. Chang's  
Lettuce Wraps are delicious.  My only wish would be for smaller orders for solo travellers.  I find the portions sizes are too much for one person.  I would like a combination plate where I can sample different items."
Had a really good meal here with great service with a reasonable price.  Good sized portions of food so be prepared to take some home.
Had pretty high expectations for P.F. Chang's. We were staying in PH so picked this place for our dinner the first night we got in. The atmosphere is great and it's a cool space. Lots of variety on the menu and it was all good but nothing really blew me away. Two of us ended up with upset stomachs though and this food was the only thing we had in common.
"There is not one item on the menu that I didn't want to try!  P.F. Chang's always has a wonderful selection that is delicious.  The prices are average but I found this last visit left me feeling very impressed with the wait staff.  They are most accommodating and polite!  Great meal, great time - highly recommend!"
"We ate here early one evening (about 5:30) The restaurant was relatively quiet, service was fantastic & the food & cocktails DELICIOUS!!! 😍 One of my friends is a strict vegetarian & the server talked her through the best dishes on the menu & made recommendations. He also recommended the Asian Pear Mojito which is honestly one of the best drinks I've ever had, just beautiful. We had some starters off the Early Bird menu then ordered mains from the standard menu. All of it was delicious & if I would've had room I definitely would of tried the Chocolate desserts. It was approximately $35pp including tip. Highly Recommended & great value."
"This PF Changs is so so busy and  If you wish to dine between 7 & 8.30pm I suggest that you book in advance or be prepared to wait up to 30 minutes
Once you finally sit down the service is slow but the food is excellent. The orange peel beef and chicken Kung po is very good"
"We stumbled upon PF Chang's while looking for some where to eat after a long hot day on the strip.  We were not disappointed!!

The food was excellent!!  

So much so, when we found another PF Chang's in Seattle after leaving Las Vegas, we had no hesitation and went right in. We weren't disappointed there either!! 

I'm going to try to find a PF Chang's every where I go now."
"PF Changs in Planet Hollywood, Vegas is truly one of our favorites.  It is a MUST whenever we visit and we always recommend our friends/family to go there and everyone comes back saying THANKS!  Service is always excellent - our server George was very friendly and didn't hesitate to answer questions on what we should order.  Their lettuce wraps are always good, and the Mongolian Beef the absolute best.  Upon George's recommendation, we ordered their Basa fish dish and were not disappointed.  The food is always great here and well worth the wait if you do go!"
"we were craving Chinese food and the place did not disappoint! family style with lot of options to choose from. Drink options are great!
had a lovely time."
We had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant chain and I must say it lived up to its reputation! We hadn't had a good Chinese meal in a long time but this place served excellent food. Service was great and we would definitely try PF Changs again.
The food is very well prepared and the service is excellent.  Every staff member does a very good job.
"Pf Chang's is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas! Love the Shaking Beef and they have some great cocktails, such as the Asian Pear Mojito. As well,the stuffed wontons are delicious."
Great service and environment.  Fantastic food.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  Everything was also very hot and fresh when it arrived at our table
I really love this place.  The food is great and the atmosphere is awesome.  We come here for my birthday every year.
This was as good as it always is. It is a must do place when we are in Vegas. Oder the lettuce wraps
One of best meals while on 3 weeks holiday in USA . Every dish was delicious with great service. Very busy but didn't have to wait long for table.
"I'm so in love with this place. Most of the appetizers are mouth watering, I would recommend trying the dynamite shrimps. Singapore street noodles are great. The spicy crispy chicken is good. Eggplant is great. 
Overall, it's a great place, average prices, big portions and a good taste of Chinese food."
Probably best to make a reservation at this hugely popular Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. The service is always great and the food is fantastic.
"We booked in here on other reviews and we were not disappointed. 
We sat upstairs which gave us a good view of the strip. The service was friendly and efficient, and despite turning up 20 minutes early we were seated promptly and received our drinks very quickly. 

We could not decide what to order so opted for the set menu for two people. ($45 excluding drinks). For soup i chose hot and sour whilst my girlfriend opted for the egg soup. Mine was not too spicy but good flavour, my girlfriends was a little bland (and why it does not get 5 *).

However, the pork dumplings (pan fried) were just incredible and more than made up for the soup. it came with a really good sauce and they were exceptionally tasty. 

For mains we had chang's spicy chicken and mongolian beef. My girlfriend never eats beef but once she tried it she could not leave it alone, that combined with the chicken made for a very good meal. 

I would certainly recommend and go back there again should we come back to Vegas. Give it a go!"
"I admit it, I love PFChangs and I was happy to find thus one for lunch - off the Strip and with plenty of parking.  We were there on a Friday afternoon and were able to be seated quickly. 

They have a great view of The Strip through wide open expansive glass windows. 

The service was very good as was the food. 

This is a great alternative to the bumper to bumper Strip area!"
Ordered the dumplings both of us could of lived without.  Not a good flavour other then the salty taste .  In the future would try something else there but not that
This place is amazing. By far one of the best meals you will have in Vegas. You are crazy to NOT go here. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. The hard part is deciding what to order! So many great dishes so going with 3 or more people is great cause you can all share dishes. I've been to PF Changs 3 times and it was fantastic every time. Love the lettuce wraps (its the only place you will catch me eating a lettuce wrap! lol). Server was great as well.
"We have been here quite a few times. Each time we go to vegas we make sure that we carve out a special trip to pf chang's at LEAST once!
This time around we were very disappointed and we aren't sure if we are going to keep returning.
Normally mongolian beef is just delicious and to die for, but this time, it was tough and chewy and fatty :( :(
When this is the meal you've been looking forward to for months and its gone downhill, it sucks.
Also they've changed the lunch sized portions.. much smaller and plated more casually... so all around lame.
Glad we didn't go for dinner time and pay $5 more per entree if it was going to be poor quality."
"One of the best Chinese cuicines I've ever dines on! 
I ate the mongolian beef, and my wife had chicken. Both of the meals was great.
The staff was very friendly, but the music was too loud, regarding the fact that this is a restaurant."
"We returned to PF Changs for another excellent dinner. This place is always busy so I recommend making a reservation, which I've always been able to do even with only 1 or 2 hours notice. We were seated immediately. The service was great and the food once again was yummy. We always return to this ""staple"" in Vegas, and are already looking forward to the next visit. (we went twice for dinner on the same trip)"
"Food was very  well prepared, presentation was excellent..  Very nice clean, comfortable seating. Service was courteous and prompt. I would go back again!"
We went here to eat on the r4ecommendation of a co-worker and boy am I glad we did. The food here is excellent and really good value. Will definitely go back again.
Visited here with friends. Nice place and prices weren't terrible. Had an enjoyable time and our server was very nice.
"I know some perceive this as just another chain restaurant, but nonetheless, the food is delicious! If you go during happy hour, the appetizers are served in smaller portions and for a reduced price so you can try more items. The steamed pork dumplings are wonderful, and the won ton soup has a shrimp in it! I would have never tried lettuce wraps because they sound boring, but I sampled some else's, and now I see why they're so famous. They have many choices for tea as well. We sat upstairs by the window so could people watch on The Strip right below. Get there early, or you might have to wait. It is so easy to get here as it is right off the casino floor in Planet Hollywood."
This is my go to every time I visit Vegas. Lettuce wraps are a must. Food quality and service have always been great on each visit.
This was one of the rare restaurants where i loved every dish we ordered. Thats a rarity. Stared with vegetable lettuce wraps which are much tastier than they sound....and boy was the lettuce fresh!! For mains we had almond & cashew chicken and mandarin chicken. Both dishes were supremely flavorful and very different from one another. We topped up with thai basil sambal noodles which gave a great coconut flavor to our meal. Would definitely visit again and again.
"Very good. All the food we had was excellent. Service was good. I didn't want to give it a try due to all the other non-chain restaurants in the area, but was pleasantly surprised. Would recommend giving it a try."
"This restaurant is consistent with the quality of PF Chang's.  It is super crowded though, so go on ""off"" times."
"Overall, I am a big fan of PF Chang's. They were able to accommodate us via reservation which was very cool. This provided my family the chance to get all pretty and stuff. First impression, though is of this flamboyant teenage boy who presents with an ""I'm better than you attitude"" ""how can I help you?"" while he is making eye contact with my 14 year-old son as if he was the one who was paying for the bill. He then, proceeded to give us a pager and say ""it will be another 10 to 15 minutes"", WAIT, didn't I make a reservation for the same reason to avoid the wait. Anyway, the rest of the experience was fabulous. The food, service, value, and quality of the food was superb. The prices are reasonable given that the restaurant is on the strip. Our hostess ""Aquila"" was accommodating, friendly and provided great suggestions when prompted. We will definitely go back. I just hope that Mr. host obtains additional training on hospitality and service."
Usual menu plus a full bar.  Good service and food.  Noisy even though it wasn' crowded during our visit.  Rest rooms are in the adjacent casino.
This is the 2nd PF Chang's we have eaten at - 1st in Seattle - and delicious.  Good value and wonderful service
"It is just another US PFChang's, but is good to have one around when you are travelling. My kids enjoyed a lot having dinner here."
Still one of our favourite places in Vegas. The service wasnt as good as before but the food is always excellent. Excellent value for money too
The food caters to american palette .  Their dining area  is spacious and cooking area is open .   I find the food here less greasy. I love orange chicken and the Lettuce wrap. Price is reasonable.
"Did the job of feeding the family well, with friendly good service.

I was only disappointed because I have eaten at PF Changs through the US & this one is more cafeteria style than any other.  Although the good was ok, it was not the. 'Great' experience I've enjoyed elsewhere.

Staff & service were very good though."
"Reserved a booth for family dinner on Sunday night, but it wasn't available after a long wait, so my family sat at a cramped table. Appetizers came out ten minutes apart, then we waited 20 minutes for our entrees.
This used to be an enjoyable spot but now the emphasis is on pushing customers through."
My husband and I did the meal for two special and it was amazing the amount of food that we received. We each started with a different soup so we could try. The hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. Of the two the egg drop was better. Then the starter dumplings which were very good.  We then had steamed rice and brown rice with sweet and sour chicken and honey chicken.  both were very good though our preference was for the sweet and sour. Then you get a dessert choice and we took the chocolate raspberry wonton. This was amazing!! Really finished the meal with a bang.  All of this for $44.95 which is impressive for a Vegas chain restaurant. Would go back.
"very convenient location on Paradise Rd - easy parking
they have a nice bar that you can also get a quick meal at if you are in a hurry (can't keep the dice tables waiting !)"
We ate at PF Changs and it was great. My partner is gluten and dairy free and it was so nice to find somewhere we could eat. There are plenty of gluten free selections and the staff were knowledgeable at what was in all the dishes. Great environment and location was perfect. Thanks so much PF Changs :)
"My husband and I are in Vegas for business.  We travel here 3 - 5 times each year.  We enjoy Asian cuisine, so always try to choose an Asian food restaurant when here.  We have not eaten at this PF Chang's, and since we don't have one in our hometown, have actually only eaten at one before.  Our meal was delicious!  We did have to wait about 30 minutes to be seated as this is a very busy restaurant.  However, we enjoyed a drink at the bar, so the wait didn't seem to take long.  Food was flavorful and tasted fresh - the chicken lettuce wrap for a starter was very good!  Service was good - our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would highly recommend this PF Chang's to those looking for a good Asian meal while eating out on the Las Vegas Strip."
Good Chinese food for a chain restaurant. Quality is consistent. Probably best Chinese food on the strip.
"Great casual dining experience - thoroughly enjoyed my evening.
Food highlights: lettuce cups and fried beans as starters followed by the ahi for main.  Yum!
Dan, our waiter was friendly and very professional. 
We were disappointed in the fried wontons - insuffient filling. We mentioned this to Dan, the Manager then came to see us and he offered to remove the cost of the wontons from our bill. Nice touch and much appreciated.
Ambience - stylish.
Value - very good for what you get.
Liked it so much I also tried the one in Waikiki Hawaii - it was good - but not as good as Vegas."
"I absolutely love PF Changs, but this location didn't work out too well for us.  The gluten free fried rice was under done and was nasty.  Our waiter took our order and then we didn't see him again until we were ready to leave!  We had to stop one of the other waiters and ask if he could please get us a refill on our waters.  Definitely won't return to this location."
My wife and I visited early evening and had an excellent set meal. The choices were excellent and we were that full that we could not manage the deserts that were included. The food was very tasty and was excellent value for what we got. The restaurant is large with an outside area attached that overlooks the strip. Of note the staff can be trusted. I forgot to pick up my credit card from the table and didn't realise it missing for 24 hours. When I returned to the restaurant they had put in their safe. What a relief and thank you. We will return next time we visit Vegas.
"We needed a break from the strip and the mounds of greasy fast food joints so stopped in for a much needed reprieve. The waiter was amazing, quick and attentive. We enjoyed the Happy Hour deals that were offered until 6pm. A must have drink was the Red Sangria! The Salt and pepper calamari was to die for and the California rolls were awesome! We also had the pork dumplings that were done to perfection! If you are planning a trip to vegas this is a must stop location to done at!"
"So pleased to have found this little gem of a restaurant during our stay in Vegas! Chinese is definitely my favourite type of food and I was looking forward to seeing what was on offer in Vegas. We arrived and had a 20 minute wait for a table which was fine as we hadn't booked. I ordered vegetable spring rolls which were lovely and my partner ordered the pork dumplings pan fried. His starter was without a doubt one of the best things I've ever tasted and I certainly had food envy! They were absolutely gorgeous. For mains I had the honey chicken and my partner had sweet and sour chicken. A word of warning- the portion size is HUGE and I ended up leaving half of my chicken (which isn't like me!)...the mains came with a small bowl of boiled rice which we didn't realise and we ordered chicken fried rice to go with it too- food overload! All in all with starters, mains, a beer and a diet coke (which was free refills) our bill was just over $60...amazing value and absolutely gorgeous food- I would maybe go as far to say the best Chinese I've had! Lovely evening with good atmosphere."
"A fantastic place, especially for those who are gluten free. An amazing selection of food for both GF and non GF people. Both of our meals were very tasty, massive portions. Loved it so much we're going back tomorrow. Highly recommended."
"Attached to the Planet Hollywood Casino and Hotel, PF Chang's provides real Chinese cuisine with excellent meals and choice beverages and teas.  Our waiter was professional and friendly.  He checked back often and provided feedback on local attractions."
"We came here in the middle of the afternoon, the place was about half full, certainly not busy.  Each course was very tasty but took way too long to come out.  I would expect some delays during the dinner rush or while the place was hopping but there was no reason it should have taken that long.  To their credit, they wrote off our appetizers when we complained about the delay.  Overall, I'd recommend it but be prepared to hang out for a bit."
"P.F. Chang's is a standard favorite of ours.  It is conveniently located right on the Las Vegas strip inside the Planet Hollywood.  What to expect:  Great food, excellent service at a reasonable price.  Their lettuce wraps are a personal favorite.  The nice thing about the Las Vegas location is they have outdoor seating facing the Las Vegas strip.  

I have eaten at P.F. Chang's in many cities and always rely on their consistent, high quality food."
"Just love this restaurant - the atmosphere is great, drinks are great, fabulous appetizers, waitstaff always seems happy and cheerful.  Great prices for happy hour on both drinks and appetizers. Love that you can pick two or three main plates and share - quantities are plentiful and the selection is big.  They have outdoor seating so you can people watch the Strip, but I prefer the quiet and subdued indoor seating - you would never know from this quiet ambiance that the casino is right on the other side of the door."
"Good food!!! 
I loved the chicken lettuce wraps, was meal sized for happy hour.
Didn't like the $9 charge for a virgin mojito...and upon questioning the bill our waiter claimed ""it's because of all the different ingredients he has to use to make it"".  Ummm..what?!  I am pretty sure the mint leaf was less than half a penny to toss in there.  Sheesh!"
Went here for a celebration and the good was good along with the service.  Would highly recommend this restaurant for others to eat at.
"Friends took us for late lunch.
One ordered for every one and another paid.
Never saw a menu but ate well. We all did.
The bill was less than $120 and 6 people stuffed their guts.
The food was fresh and delicious.
Drinks were also spectacular. I liked the Moscow Mule very much as I like ginger beer.
Staff was attentive and paid attention to everyone at the table, not just the guy paying.
I stayed at Planet Hollywood 6 years ago and regret not eating here then.
I hope to dine here again. Tastier than many other meals we ate during this trip."
"We stopped by for a relatively late dinner. The food was excellent, fresh, great tasting, and not overly greasy (grease is always a risk with chinese food).

Service was friendly and efficient.

Would definitely go back."
"We were in the mood for Asian Food and PF Chang's was close to our hotel. There was a waiting list so we decided to have drinks at the bar and wait for our table. The bartender (Tony) found a couple of seats for us and promptly served us a drink. He was very friendly and attentive. We decided to eat at the bar, so we ordered an appetizer (fried green beans) and shared an entree (orange chicken). Our food was delivered quickly and was wonderful!!! We had so much fun there that we went back the next night for drinks and appetizers (fried green beans and pork dumplings) before we attended a show. Everyone at PF Chang's was friendly....even the customers. It is crowded and noisy there but we still enjoyed it. It is Vegas after all!!!"
we went here while in Vegas in July. We ate lunch here.  There was no wait for us seated right away and the server was prompt and attentive and ready to answer our questions we had the beef recommended by the Waiter and rice nice portions and food was good. Would recommend you eat here.
"We visited on a Tuesday night, around 11pm, with a 25 minute wait.  Took 10 minutes to get someone by just to order water.  The food was good, just as it is at every PF Changs.  So, the location and service are what's rateable.  Easy to find on the strip, not overly crowded table spaces.  Once the waiter acknowledged us, he was prompt and attentive."
"Everyone of the eight items that my family and I enjoyed were excellent.  There was a slight mix up on our order and instead of sending the incorrect dish back to the kitchen, the waiter comped the dish to us for us to enjoy and that's exactly what we did.  Service also was excellent.  I know this is a chain but still a place I'd recommend."
Ended up going to Chang's around 9:30 and the place was still packed.  The food and service were as good as usual.  I love the Chang's spicy chicken.
"We love PF Chang's and decided to have an early dinner there on Tuesday, July 8th. Man, was that a mistake! First, we were told there would be a 25 minute wait for a table and that the bar was full. I was OK with the wait and was prepared to wait for a table but then a Manager asked if we wanted to go to the bar upstairs. We said ""yes"" and headed upstairs wondering why the kid at the welcome station didn't tell us about the option. We sat down at the bar and the look on the face of the male bartender (I did not get his name but he was from Memphis) was of shock and disbelief. It was like ""what are you doing here""? And needless to say, the service and food to follow was in tune with that attitude. This guy was not in the mood to serve us, was so unconcerned about our service and the food served, that it was a joke! He never asked how we were doing, what else we needed, etc. We even overheard a conversation he had with another worker that he was going to go part-time. Part-time??? He was already acting like he had left! This terrible service plus the fact that Chang's had revised their menu (one of our favorite dipping sauces was not offered anymore) and mediocre food convinced us to not come back here or maybe not to any other PF Chang's."
"We visited PF Changs on the 4th July, the restaurant was very busy but we didn't have too long to wait, the menu was delicious with a very good selection of dishes, we ended up ordering too much food as we couldn't decide, the portion sizes were very big and we should not have ordered the appetisers, but the breaded prawns just sounded too tasty to refuse and they were delicious.the prices were very reasonable too."
"Was there last year , actually in April 2013 . Was there with two brothers and a mate . I had this place reccomended to me and chose to go there for my birthday celebration meal . A decent sized resturant , pretty mobbed while i was there with other groups and parties . The staff were very friendly , our table was in the centre of the resturant , there was always a member of staff on hand . The food was prepared and brought to us in very reasonable time. The plate fulls were a good size the food was very tasty . And unlike some places we were not constantly hampered or rushed by staff , we were able to enjoy our meal . Id definetly go back.
Worth the money ."
"We were in town for a dance competition with a lot of kids. We had a party of 20 and they gave us a private dining room without any additional charge that was perfect for our needs. 

Food is the same as their other locations - however, so are their prices which is rare among chains on the strip. 

Great experience - highly recommend!"
"Not the best .
Not sure if we ordered the right things but the food was decidedly average. 
No fried rice the day we went as there machine had broken ??
Starters were nice . Mains, had better from the licks take away .
Not worth the money ."
"The PF Chang's team went out of their way to make the pre-wedding social a huge success. We (all 80 of us) had flown down to Las Vegas for the wedding. We were given the entire upper floor to ourselves. The staff were super attentive. Their interaction with all the guests went way beyond anything we could have asked for. The entire food selection that was served could only be described as delicious.  There were too many entrees to list. The drink selections were mind blowing. The service was beyond anything I would have expected from a ""Restaurant Chain"". But then again it was July 04 long weekend in Las Vegas"
"Best Chinese meal. Wife and I had Hot and sour soup, great! We also had the signature wraps between us, again lovely. I then had salt and pepper prawns and and wife had some thing with beef. Both were amazing. To compliment our feast we shared chicken fried rice. Again top notch. Could not fault. Will be back before we leave...."
Visited here for dinner during 4th of July week. Ordered the Orange Chicken with brown rice. I also had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls which were great. Very packed due to the weekend but service was excellent.m
Visited twice during our stay in Las Vegas and neither visit disappointed service both visits was good and they have a Gluten free menu which is ideal for my wife. They even gave her sauces to mix to suit diet. Waiter on second visit when we seated upstairs was especially helpful.
"My husband and I were staying upstairs in Planet Hollywood .  Our first night we dined at Chang's Restaurant , but only after a thirty minute wait in the foyer .   The wait was worth while ! Great menu, tasty Asian / Oriental dishes, not over expensive at all .     The huge horse outside PH. guards the king inside the restaurant !!!"
"What a meal ! So much we took away in a ""doggy"" bag more than half. The tastiest meal we have had for a long time, and not expensive. If we had been in LA longer would have gone there again."
We were in planet Hollywood and needed dinner... we'd been to PF Changs plenty of times but not in vegas.  We're so glad we stopped in! Food was reliably delicious. We had the lemongrass chicken spring rolls from the summer menu to start..yum! I had the curried veggie dish and husband had the cashew chicken both were excellent. We also had the Changs Mai tai super strong and super good! Most importantly though our server was outstanding! Juan had many tables but you wouldn't know that if you weren't paying attention. He made good recommendations from the menu and was very attentive.
"PF Chang's was well above and beyond what I expected. Especially for the prices, which are very reasonable for LV. Food was great and they have incredible drinks!"
I really enjoy PF Chang's Hot & Sour soup.  I do feel that the service at this particular PF Chang's is not up to the PF Chang's standard.  Food wasn't quite as good as usual either!  It is still very good but not excellent as most other PF Chang restaurants.
"We had a great meal at P.F. Chang's in Las Vegas on 6/28/2014.  My son is allergic to dairy and egg which always makes eating a challenge.  At P.F. Chang's they have a system where they can type in the allergies and print out a customized menu.  They quickly printed us a menu before we sat down so we could review our options.  When we did sit down, the manager came over to speak with us and assured us they were considerate of our special needs.  We ordered the seared tuna appetizer, chicken lettuce wraps, and vegetarian fried rice for our son (yes we all shared).  He absolutely loved the food and everything as prepared as needed without dairy, butter, & egg.  All of us enjoyed our fantastic meals and excellent service.  What a fantastic evening and our family will most certainly be visiting P.F. Chang's again all over the USA.  Great job by P.F. Chang's in Las Vegas for making a special night for our family."
"Very good friends invited me .... hostess handed us a paper and we followed into the kitchen?! My friend and myself with canes tried to navigate the extremely slippery floor. Keep in mind we are only in our 50s and by no means elderly.
We enter a very nasty elevator and exit onto a really nice 2nd floor. Food and table service were very good.
If you go, don't use the kitchen entrance."
"Having previously eaten in the Houston PF Chang's, we knew what to expect so we stopped in here for an early lunch. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, which are my favorite. You get a huge portion for an appetizer so I ordered it as my main. My boyfriend ordered his usual, Chang's Spicy Chicken. 
PF Chang's is a decent place, not too expensive and reliably decent food. The decor is nice and the service is always friendly."
"Not your traditional msg laden Chinese food. I had the most amazing dish, a prawn, melon and walnut dish that was so delicious and unique I came back for it for lunch before I left Vegas! There were 8 of us and every dish was great! The service amazing! Our server Juan, was excellent. Got to try this place. Great menu and staff!"
"I brought friends here as I had eaten here quite a few years ago and had a great meal. Not the case this time. The service was poor. The waiter seemed like he has somewhere else to be. The food was average. Three of the mains were brought and left although the starters had not been cleared away. The fourth main came later. The people at the next table got one incorrect order and that lady got her correct meal after the other people in her party had finished. There was a wedding on so I'm not sure if that impacted the service but I imagine Vegas restaurants are used to wedding parties by now.  
I wouldn't eat there again-there are too many other fantastic places in Vegas to try."
"We visited here after our friends wedding, the food was great. Staff very welcoming and friendly. Would recommend"
"The restaurant is inside PH casino, so I knew to call ahead and make a reservation.  Our table was ready at the designated time, so we passed right by all the poor suckers that had a 45 minute wait.
Our waiter was engaging, fun, and genuinely seemed glad that we were there.  We all had a great time talking, laughing, and eating and the atmosphere was upbeat and lively.  The food was excellent and as expected from PF Chang's.  My second trip to this location and we will be back."
Great service great food great atmosphere.  I have gluten allergy and they catered brilliantly with gluten free options and gluten free beer. If in Vegas a must ! Both myself and my friend very impressed with service and with the food.
"We have eaten at PF Chang's several times in Atlanta, but never in Vegas. It was really out of desperation that we tried this one out in Vegas. Every place we went had a long line in front of it to get in. We happened to see the sign for PF Chang's and miraculously, ,no wait at 6:00 pm on a Friday night. We were able to immediately get a table for 4. The server was nice and attentive. We all enjoyed our dinner. My husband ordered an appetizer of egg rolls, and I ordered an entree and we split it. It was PLENTY of food for both of us!  The children's menu was a good deal because it included the drink.  Is it gourmet dining, no, but it was good food at a decent price!"
"We just love PF Changs!  We have been to several other PF Changs and have never been disappointed.  We both agree that the serving size was much larger then the PF Changs at the Millenia Mall.  Everything was delicious.  We usually get the two for $39.95 special which includes soup, appetizer, entree and a share dessert.  The drop soup delicious, the lettuce wraps to die for and the Mongolian beef just can't get enough of it!  We wish it were closer to home so we could go more often!"
"We sat at the bar and had a variety of appetizers.  The lettuce wraps were very delicious, as always.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  We love going there when we visit Las Vegas and will return on our next trip."
"We knew we were in trouble when they placed cutlery on the table instead of chopsticks. 
Food is not Chinese, nor an elevated twist on classic dishes, it's just a poor imitation of the real thing. Nothing had any flavour even though most dishes were covered in goopy sauces. Even the drinks were bad. Skip it."
I don't go to PF Chang's much but I did this visit and it was just plain to me. The service was very good but the food not to good they do give you a big portion of food. Rice was the only thing really good plus servcie.
Know it's a chain but it's a nice place to eat right at Planet Hollywood and the outside dining you can watch the Strip buzzing by and the people watching is great. Food was quite tasty- sweet and sour chicken was quite sweet and the Mongolian Beef was a bit too salty but mix it with the rice provided and it worked perfectly - especially if you mixed the two. Would definitely recommend.
"While staying in Las Vegas recently, we decided to try PF Chang's. We were very happy we did. The food was excellent, and the service was great. We ended up going two more before we left."
"Wonderful shrimp potstickers and shrimp with lobster sauce. Very attentive waiter, fast service, plenty of food."
"Walking down the Las Vegas strip, I stopped at the P.F. Chang's Planet Hollywood. It has a perfect location, staff are nice, and food is stellar!"
We have been to multiple PF Chang's throughout the US. This was the worst experience by far. Our server Mariam seemed to pay very little attention to our table. We literally had to call her every time we needed something. The food can be a lot better. I had to speak to the manager about the server. He was appreciative enough for our feedback. I hope we get a better experience the next time we visit since we love PF Chang overall.
"My friends had been raving about this restaurant, so I decided I had to check it out. We had to wait quite a while for a table, but were given a buzzer for when we were able to be seated. The food was nice, fresh and tasty. The staff were fast and friendly. But considering the amazing choice of brilliant dining options in Las Vegas, I would not go rushing to go here."
"Visited this location twice in one week it was that spectacular.  Prices aren't crazy and the food is outstanding.  Semi-formal Asian fair, served quickly and professionally.  The staff were fantastic with their suggestions and I will say that if i could have just one dish from PF's it would be the grilled sea bass - it was simply outstanding.  It's on my ""return to"" list for sure."
out of our week in vegas this was our favorite meal very reasonably priced and great service the quality of food there is excellent
Excellent meal!  Make sure you go before 6:00 for happy hour.  They have half price appetizers and discounted drinks.
Booking is a must. Rven tho the restaurant was packed out the good was as great as always and our waitress (Robin) was very helpful with the menu to those who'd not eaten at PF Changs before. We love the lettuce wraps & Mongolian beef.
"We love going to P.F. Chang's in Las Vegas. The service is always excellent and the service is consistently great.
We enjoy going to the one in Las Vegas more than any where else."
"We arrived at happy hour which helped with value.  One of our servers from the beach club at our hotel recommended this restaurant.  The food was awesome the drinks were to die for, real ingredients not fake syrups.  The bartenders/servers were all great."
"May marked my 7th trip to Vegas...and my 1st time to PF Changs.  It was awesome!  My friend and I wanted to sit on a patio for dinner before heading to a show.  Although this patio seemed pretty busy, YOLOs was packed, so we decided we would wait for a seat.  We actually didn't have to wait at all for a table as someone had just left.  We ended up splitting 3 appetizers and having a drink.  The lettuce wraps were super good, as was the california roll and the crispy green beans.  Decent prices, for half of the food and my drink it was just under $20 - and there was more than enough food for 2 people.  Our waiter was super friendly (almost overly attentive).  I will definitely be back!"
"We love going to P.F. Chang's in Las Vegas. The service is always excellent and the service is consistently great.
We enjoy going to the one in Las Vegas more than any where else."
"We visited the PF Chang's Las Vegas located in Planet Hollywood on Saturday, May 31 while visiting Vegas for my mother's 60th birthday.  We had made reservations at 7pm, and arrived a few minutes beforehand.  I walked up to the hostess podium, and the hostess said ""Name?""  No welcome, no friendly smile, nothing.  We were given a buzzer, and after waiting about 10 minutes, were seated.

We waited 15 minutes, before we flagging down a server to take our drink order.  ""I am not your server, but I will find out who is.""  He left, and we waited another 5 minutes.  Then he came back and said ""I am not sure who your server is, but don't worry, I'll beat him when I find him.""  Really?  My family owns a chain of successfull restaurants in Minneapolis, so I was not impressed thus far.  He took our drink and dinner order, and promised to locate our server.

A short while later, a gentleman showed up with our drinks and said that he would be our server.  No ""sorry for the confusion"", etc. 

The food was excellent, par the usual for PF Chang's, which we also frequent in Minneapolis.  We enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken and Honey Crispy Shrimp, along with the fried calamari for an appetizer.  I would give the meal 4 stars, but the service a 2.  We frequent Vegas twice a year and will not be returning to this restaurant nor would we recommend this location."
"Fantastic food, couldn't fault it. Service was good although wouldn't say amazing. If with a group try and get sat in one of the booth type areas, nice and private. Would highly this restaurant!"
Visited PF Chang's in Las Vegas the beginning of May 2014. You can't go wrong with PF Chang's. Food was excellent as with the service from the waitress. I always walk away from there filled as the proportions are a good size.
"Love PF Chang's!
Great location....amazing service and the food is outstanding. 
We treated ourselves to wine, appetizers, and dinner. There was NO room for dessert! There are many different areas to sit for a very unique experience."
This is a chain.  Just about identical to every other PF Change out there.  Kung pow scallops were just so so (who breads scallops? ).  Tiramisu was above average.
"Food was very good, there was professional wait staff, had a great time. A bit pricey but Vegas is pricey."
As always the service and food were amazing.  Every chance we get we always visit PF Changs.  The closest to us is in Boston so when in an area that has one it is always one of our stops.
"We were greeted and seated promptly without any reservation. Yes we had an issue
with the delivery of our appetizer coming at the same time as our entree. Our food
was excellent. The price was not inflated like in other parts of Planet Hollywood."
"We love P.F. Chang's are were glad to find one attached to our hotel, Planet Hollywood.  It was a relatively mild day, for Las Vegas, and we sat outside to enjoy our meal.  The service and food was excellent.  The only downside was that as we finished our meal, the ""nightlife"" began!  Quite a few questionable people ""parked"" right outside the fenced area...."
"Great service and food was awesome, location is very convenient and close to everything downtown.  Inside planet Hollywood is a plus."
"So disappointed in this experience. We went at 10 pm Sat night and although tables were empty and some had dirty dishes, there was a wait. We should have realized management did not have it together. After waiting 30 minutes, our appetizer came and within 2-3 minutes our entree. we never got our spciy sauces nor clean plates. Really bad in its entirety."
"the food is just delicious, we went in and booked for the following evening, we were asked if it was for a celebration we told them it was for my 50th they said they would make a note of that, don't know why as there was no mention of it when we were there. we had the Mongolian beef, noodles, and pork dumplings good food, and good service, would recommend."
"Waiting time for over an hour! By the time we were ready to be seated, we were famished. Were offered quite a few ""on the house"" dishes to make up for it. Fresh, tasty and a good variety of food."
Quality and quantity of food is outstanding. Very attentive service and reasonable prices make this restaurant as good as it gets when looking for oriental food. Lettuce Wraps are best in the business. Honey Crispy Chicken or Shrimp are fabulous as was the Mongolian Beef dish. Huge Cheesecake dessert to die for as they say.
"Open from 11am till late it has great spare ribs and good chinese food and drinks at a good price, large servings."
"Although the food was very good it was excelled by the service mainly from the waitress Sarah & the follow up by the manageress Stefanie, Sarah had a fantastic knowledge of the food & wine & couldn't have looked after us any better, she was very friendly & funny. Stefanie came over to us after the meal to check everything was okay & we told them it couldnt have been better, thanks to Sarah. Would recommend this restaurant to everyone."
"Pf changs is in planet Hollywood casino.

We had 4 course lunch for 2 people for $45.

Food was delicious and plenty of it. 

Hot & sour soup was the stand out."
"We visited PF Changs during our week long visit to Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed it. The food was outstanding, the service was fantastic and the atmosphere was brilliant.

We had the set meal for 2 and chose hot and sour soup, spare ribs, the sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef and had cheesecake for dessert. It was all absolutely delicious. We only had soft drinks and got free refills all night, which was excellent.

Our server was lovely, very attentive and food came quickly. 

We tried to book in on our last night, but even though we booked a table via our concierge for 7pm, we were told it would be approximately 35 minutes to wait for the first available table. We decided to go somewhere else as the two of us plus the couple we were travelling with were all hungry.

All in all, this was the best meal we had and would have loved to have eaten there again. Its always busy but with the food they serve, its not surprising."
"Went to Chang's after remembering a tasty visit there many years ago. Was very busy on arrival but was seated quickly. Service was good, starter was lovely, tasty and well presented. The disappointment was with the main course. My chicken with almonds was pretty flavourless and had the consistency of a chicken in sauce that has been left for quite some time, the sauce was congealed and jelly like in places creating a pretty unpleasant consistency.  The orange chicken (I think) that my wife had was tastier and the rice dish was ok and BIG, was still obvious it had been cooked for a while - a fairly expensive but disappointing meal overall, especially when really looking forward to it following my last visit."
Great food and friendly and efficient staff. Would highly recommend. We and the other couple we were with ordered the dinner for two with different dishes so that we could sample a number of different dishes they prepared. All were very good!
For some reason the food here didn't taste as good as other P.F.Chang's I have been to in the past. If you can I would eat somewhere else.
"Let me start by saying this is the first PF Chang's we have been to.  We didn't plan on going to this restaurant, but stumbled upon it.  
We had to wait only 15 minutes and the place was packed.  We had a table on the patio which looks right out onto the Strip.  We had an appetizer, a drink each and a meal and the price was under $60.  Which is great for a restaurant right on the Strip.
The service was great, thanks Mike.  He recommended the Kung Pow Chicken and it was amazing.  I could eat that everyday! 
We will go back for sure."
"We had a large party celebrating a family birthday.  We had called ahead and they gave us a great private room, that was quiet and we could enjoy our family.  the service was top notch as was the food.  They brought a great birthday treat for our mom.  Would will certainly go back on our next stop in Vegas."
We had a group of 8 for dinner. The food and service were great! Recommend the lettuce wraps and the honey shrimp.
"When I was last in Las Vegas I had the pleasure of eating at P.F Chang's. I knew food in America was better than England... but this place blew me away! The prawns were amazing, service was good, food was hot and filled with so much flavour. Will definately be going back when I'm next in Vegas!!"
The waiter was very attentive and great. Food was delicious!  Always a treat to go to PF Changs as we don't have them in Canada.
"This is another of our ""go to"" places while in Las Vegas. The service was great, along with the food. Of course, started out with the lettuce wrap which easily served 3 people. Then ordered a couple of meals which we shared, so that we could taste more. One was the kung pao chicken and the other, honey shrimp. Excellent!    The honey chicken was perfect, not dipped in honey, just the taste, with other spices. Well done chef!"
"The food was not as good as our PF Chang's in Austin or San Antonio, but the bar service was excellent.  Fabulous bartenders!!"
"I am not sure what Real Chinese food is like, but I am pretty sure this is not it. Pretty much below comparable North American style Chinese food restaurants. Service was good however."
Everything on the menu is awesome. I sat outside and great views of Bellagio across the street. Friendly staff. Drinks are good too.
"Oil, Oil , Oil. Thats the taste of my food during my visit P.E Changs. Better options next door. Dont waste your time and money..."
"I had never eaten at PF Changs although there are some in the area I live.  I can say nothing bad about the food.  Our meal included chicken wraps, sweet sour shrimp, a beef dish, and a chicken dish.  All of the food was excellent.  I could've eaten the shrimp all night.  Never tasted any so delicious.  We were waited on quickly, and the wait staff was very courteous.  I would definitely go there if visiting Vegas again and will try the one in the Chicago Area."
"We love, love, love PF Changs.  Being from Canada, the only time we get to enjoy is when we go to Vegas.  Our favorite/mainstay menu item is the Dinner for Two.  There is just the right amount of food with a great variety of dishes.  It can get very busy around dinnertime, so always try to make a reservation."
"This is a big place and very busy. But this does not detract from the excellent selection of food. We went twice and everything we tried was excellent and the portions were designed for giants.
Quick service but in spite of its size, we had to wait 20 mins each time. No probs, we just popped into the casino with a pager. Never made it to the sweet!"
"We visited for lunch and it is a nice atmosphere like most PF Changs.  We were seated quickly in a nice booth. Our waiter was extremely slow and not very attentive so this explains the low rating.  We ordered a few drinks and and an appetizer ( the delicious lettuce wraps), which came out quickly.  However , the main entree took forever.  There were no apologies about the wait even though it was not busy.  The assistant manager actually had to check on the food for us.  Having a horrible waiter can ruin any dining experience and mine was ruined because of this."
Good food reasonable prices I really love PF Changs but the one here was particularly yummy we also received gift cards for all 3 in our party as a anniversary promotion which was really nice the service was great our server was funny and quick and accommodated our special requests wonderful food would highly recommend
"What a disgrace to the chain. I attempt to go there when they first open.  The doors are locked.  They are also dirty with dried saliva on the outside.  So when we are walking away, the man comes and opens the door.  We are greeted by the host who hasn't moved an inch because he is behind his counter with his iPhone in hand and drinking tea or soda....so I ignore that....we are seated outside.  The window that faces the strip had some dried substance that looked like mucus or something...ick!!  So we are moved....then we are looking at the menu prices...I don't wanna pay that much for food when I am surrounded by mucos and saliva with bad service...I picked up and left & probably won't return....shame on you!"
"I can't compare this P.F. Chang's to other locations, but this one was pretty tasty.  We had planned to go elsewhere originaly but due to the long wait we decided to hit PF Changs.  Service was quick and they kept all of our drinks topped up.  We shared the Lemon chicken which was a little sweet for my taste but overall was a great experiance."
They were completed booked out for the next 30 minutes or so but offered us room at the bar which we were totally fine with because we weren't fussed :) plus you get a drink straight away at the bar so can't complain :) it was amazing as always! loved it! if you love Chinese - you will love this :)
"We had a wonderful dinner plus they had us out in lots of time for our show.
A taste treat and we will certainly go back."
Went to P.F. Chang's after reading very good reviews on here.  Got to the restaurant at 6.30pm and were seated promptly.  Ordered our food virtually straight away but were still waiting for our appetisers 40 minutes later while everyone around us seemed to be getting their food.  Eventually our entrees arrived so our appetisers were obviously forgotten.  We said nothing but when we started eating our food it was almost cold although it did look good.  Our server who did not seem bothered asked us if everything was ok which we replied it was not.  She sent the manager over to see us and after expressing our feelings to her she did to her credit try to resolve our issues.  However by that time we had had enough and were ready to go.  When we asked for our bill we were told it had been taken care of by the manager.  We feel that it was probably all down to our waitress.
My husband and I stopped here for a late night dinner after a day of gambling and drinking. The restaurant was well decorated and the food was great. Our waiter was also knowledgable about the drink menu and was able to recommend a great bottle of sake to try.
"Great patio dining in Las Vegas!  Very conscientious about food allergies. 
Attentive servers and lunch was served quickly!"
"We started with the saki tasting trio, would pass on the unfiltered next time, but everything else was great. The bbq ribs just fell off the bone, could use a couple of dozen next time, yum. I had the orange chicken dish and after the saki, don't remember what the rest of my party had, but everyone was happy."
"We were staying at planet hollywood. Loved the location of this restaurant, the food was super fresh we had prawns and noodles. Staff were great. Good value for money."
"We had an amazing meal with our group of 19, it was so good we went back two days later. We ordered 17 dishes, with 3 bottles of wine and gave a great tip and it only came to $500. For a group that large it was a good value. We were able to book the private room in the back. Nice for the size of our group but it's more fun in the restaurant. Our fav dishes were the Mongolian Beef, Thai Beef Salad, and Shrimp Kung Pao. The red wine Hess was also a great value for such a nice  Cab. Nice to feel the value when everything is quite expensive in the hotel restaurants. We've been to PF Changs in other centers and think this one exceeds the others."
I eat at P.F Chang's at Planet Hollywood every time I am in Vegas. Great service good food. Not too pricey.
"This food is tasty. It is at our local Walmart and my wife and I like it. It is fairly low in calories and it fills the two of us up every time. I've never been to the restaurant because we don't have one near our house, but the first chance i get, we will go. I'm sure that it is equally good as the grocery store product."
"we decided to go to Chang's after seeing it at the planet Hollywood. we weren't going to do any regular restaurants we can go to at home, but went anyhow. So their menu has change a little since we went last. my wife ordered Kung Pao Scllaops, and all i did was want her meal. mine was great too. they were the best scallops i've ever had! Definitely have to go again back home."
"We hit this restaurant at happy hour and absolutely feasted for a very reasonable price.  The food was fantastic!  The restaurant was busy, but the service was still very good.  Will return again."
Great Happy Hour Deals other than that just your standard PF Chang's if not the place isn't worth it.  I would go somewhere else.
"Just ordered the pad Thai with shrimp that had NO flavour
Also, beef Sichuan had hardly any beef with lots of julienned carrots celery and green onions.  Again, NO TASTE.  
I can't understand the popularity."
"This was my very 1st time at a P.F Chang's. Having heard & seen it around a few times i decided to give it a shot even though i heard mixed opinions. I have to say im glade i tried it out for myself, Located right at Planet Hollywood & The M Shops its easily accessible. Once inside everything looks great, full service bar, inside & outside dinning option, & nice decor. I just so hapend to go during happy hour, i tried two of their Mojitos which i thought were awesome however im not much of the drinker i use to be as this was the first in awhile. Food was also great, a bit pricey however being vegetarian i choose a basic fried rice with shrimp. The portion is what really took me by surprised as it was so much i had to take it to go, & this was on a hungry stomach. only complaint was that i thought my server tried to run up the bill on me. Like i said it was happy hour an the cocktail menue he showed me had drinks for $6 which i thought would bring to about 3 & i truly believe i asked & he confirmed that. however once bill came it had two drinks @ $6 and had shrimp twice @ $1 each. he removed the extra $ however stated that was the happy hour drink price as the drinks are normaly $9. However all in all, i would go back & recommend."
Went to PF Changs on recommendation of many family and friends. We had a group of 6 people and shared many dishes. Would definitely recommend Mongolian beef!
"I was very impressed by this restaurant.  The food was excellent but the service was even better.  The manager, Chris Hodges, went out of his way to make us feel welcome.  They were able to seat our large group quickly.  The staff was extremely nice and very funny.  We truly enjoyed ourselves.  I will definitely return to this locale and will be sure to visit other P.F. Chang's as well.  Thanks Chris.  You made this a great experience."
"P. F. Chang's is on the expensive side for a Chinese restaurant chain.  The food is excellent as is the cocktails...  However...four out of the six of us who attended, um, paid for it again the next day, if you catch my drift. Other than that...I did enjoy the lettuce wraps and the Asian Pear Mojito."
"My partner and I came here for my birthday meal. We like Chinese but this was in a league of it's own. 
To start with there's the view...The Bellagio Fountains WOW! 
Then there's the atmosphere, it was romantic, relaxing and welcoming. The service was absolutely brilliant and our waiter was very helpful. 
The food...WOW again. By far the best Chinese food I've ever had. It really made my birthday. If they had a Restaurant in the UK I'd be very happy!"
pf chang's is always good where ever you go. this one has a good bar and great drinks. so if you want to get a great drink good price stop in at pf changs you won't go wrong.
"Wow! Food amazing. So nice to be able to go into a restaurant with my husband and eat off the same menu.

Lots of choice for gluten free eaters, food was good, plentiful and great value for money, 2 course lunch inc drinks was $40!! Bargain!!

Staff were knowledgable and provided gluten free sauces without being prompted, such a welcome attitude too

Eaten in changs in Boston and Florida too, same brilliant experience in all locations to date
Thankyou!"
"My partner and I came here for my birthday meal. We like Chinese but this was in a league of it's own.

Then there's the atmosphere, it was romantic, relaxing and welcoming. The service was absolutely brilliant and our waiter was very helpful. 
The food...WOW again. By far the best Chinese food I've ever had. It really made my birthday. If they had a Restaurant in the UK I'd be very happy!"
"Went there yesterday, it was really good. Each person in my party ordered something different. When all four plates arrived, we all looked at each other and decided to share, all four entrees were perfectly made a good. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 was I had to wait too long for refills (I got the spicy chicken, the waitress should have brought me two sodas at a time with the rate I was sucking them down) and the overall wait time for food was a bit slow. But I would definitely go back."
"We love PF Chang's and if there is one where we are visiting, we go.  I made reservations online before we walked over and we got right in, no wait.  Others just walking in, it was an hour wait.  Great service and food quality."
"We ordered Mongolian beef, vegetable fried rice and Dahl Chicken off their gluten free menu .All were excellent and they even provided GF condiments . Excellent choice for GF eaters."
"We are frequent patrons of P.F. Chang's just about everyplace we go.  We happened to stumble across the one in the Planet Hollywood in Vegas and decided to have an early dinner.  Pricing is what you would expect in Vegas.  We sat on the patio and waited for several minutes for someone to notice where we had been seated.  Our server, got our drinks incorrect, the food we ordered was not correct was barely warm and had to be sent back.  It was zapped to heat it up. I ordered lettuce wraps for an appetizer and my wife ordered soup.  The main entrees were served to us within a couple of minutes of the appetizers and there was no room on the small table.  We had to flag down the server to get refills on water and tea.  The check came out wrong also.
This was not typical of this chain and we will continue to patronize, but not here."
I have heard about this place for a long time and never gone to one. A family friend got us in the door and they definitely kept us there. The food is excellent. The drinks equally wonderful. They have both indoor and outdoor seating which is nice. A waitress accidentally dropped a large tray full of glasses which startled everyone but accidents happen. It took nothing away from the great food at PF Chang's.
"We chose PF Chang's one early afternoon and sat on the patio. The ambience is nice, a great site for people watching on the strip! The service and food were both excellent, and the drink prices moderately priced. We enjoyed the warm sake which was refreshing. Try the sesame chicken!"
"I went to PF changs at the Planet hollywood on the 17th of feb, 2014. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and how tasty it was. We tried at least 8 different items on the menu appies, salds, main courses, ALL deliscious! the food didnt take too long to come out, the drinks however took FOREVER, I had my food before any of the drinks came out to the table, that is BAD BAD BAD in my books. One of the servers we had seemed to be avoiding us on purpose, I guess there must have been a change in shifts becuase, we got a different server. Aside from that the food was so deliscious it made up for it, maybe they were having one of those days. Would definetly go back."
"We were on our way to a show so we sat at the bar
Great service
Great lettuce wraps and dry ribs
Always great food"
This was an excellent dining out. Had the special items for dinner for two. Good choices on the menu. Service was outstanding.
"We rarely miss an opportunity to have dinner at P.F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood when we're in Las Vegas. We can always depend on fast, friendly service and delicious, hot, freshly prepared food that is reasonably priced. Note, this P.F.Chang's can be rather busy during the traditional dinner hours of 5:30-6:00 pm through 7:30 pm, or so. Try to go a little earlier or a little later to avoid what could be a lengthy wait to be seated."
I love this restaurant! My parents recommended it to me and now I know why! I found the food to be full of flavour. While the restaurant was fully booked the staff were friendly and attentive.
"Had an evening meal in PF Changs and was well pleased with quantity, quality and price and would certainly recommend to future diners."
"I found a lot of the dishes too overpowering with flavor, must be an acquired taste. Staff were were obliging and friendly."
"Had two nice eating experiences at the bar here. Great hot food, served quickly except when my dessert took about 15 minutes to arrive. When it did, they added a second dessert to it, but I hardly could eat the first and was travelling alone. I'd eat here again, as the food was great and the servers were engaging and engaged."
"Wonderful décor, excellent service and even better food.  Food arrived very promptly and freshly cook and hot.  Topped up all our drinks whether they were soda or wine for no extra charge.  Possibly best Asian I have had in a long time."
"I don't usually eat Chinese food in a foreign country and especially in the states. Joined some friends at PF Chang's for dinner one night and was surprised that the food is actually pretty decent.

I had the honey chicken which was kind of addictive, sweet, savour and cripsy with a tangy sauce. The wanton soup was tasty although i didnt quite like the wanton. We also had fried rice, kale and omelette. All in all decent comfort food.

PS: Dine in as opposed to ordering in as room service - food was a tad cold and total bill came in a lot higher with all the additional charges."
Food was really reasonably priced and atmosphere was great! Defo recommend dining here as customer service was fab! You must try the green beans to start they were delicious!
"We looked around and checked reviews for a Chinese meal in Vegas ! We went for P.F.chang's and wasn't disappointed. The set up , the layout , the staff , the food, I cannot say a bad thing against ! We both wanted different things of the menu and it came about that both things were on the set 4 course menu ($44 for 2 ) so the price was fantastic ! Everything was cooked to perfection and the portions were very generous , overall we were really impressed !"
"great dining experience and customer  service we had spring rolls, sweet & sour chicken and chicken fried rice this was just enough for the two of us. My first time to a PF Chang."
"I was in Vegas for 6 days and I had lunch and dinner at this location. The orange peel chicken and fried rice are outstanding. They also had on of the best deserts that I have ever eaten, pineapple coconut ice cream. The service was also very good."
Amazing food with a variety for everyone's taste buds.  I usually order the chicken cashew with a small brown rice and a side of veggies. Or their shrimp stir fry is amazing.  My friends order their orange chicken and steamed white rice. They love it and haven't changed their order since their first day.  I also recommend the coconut shrimp with mango dip.
"After having a bad experience at the planet hollywood buffet we thought we would try lunch at PE. Changs.  We have eaten there a number of times and knew what to expect.  Great tasting food, reasonable price.  Service was a little slow, maybe it was just our waiter."
This is always a must-stop place for us when we are in town. If it is warm enough we love to eat on the patio and watch the people go by. The food is reasonably priced and served promptly. We love that the managers come around to check on you and they will even bring you additional sodas or clear plates personally. It's a nice touch!
Never been there and had bad service or bad food.  Great everytime.  Been across the country and tried it in about 5 other locations...wish Canada had them
"One star, because there was nothing lower, rice sucked, and it was the highlight
, because everything else was worse, makes mcdonalds look like gourmet, save your money, go to some $1.00 buffet"
Start with the lettuce wraps one of our favorites. We ordered the meal for 2 special. I think it was right at $45. Great value and best of all excellent food. Get table upstairs by window for people watching entertainment.
"Excellent service, food was delicious! There was no wait for a table had a nice view from windows.  Food arrived quickly, large portions, and loved the gluten free options!"
I've never eaten at a PF Changs before. The food was delicious!  Looking forewrd to finding another.  The wonton soup is so different yet so full of a lot of goodness.
Went to have a late meal after the Brittany concert.  We were seated quickly. Our waitress was amazing.  Service with a smile and more.  Our whole meal was just great.  No room for desert though.
"On a recent trip to Las Vegas, we made our usual visit to P.F Chang's.  We had the 'dinner for 2' and it was excellent value!  It consisted of - a choice of 2 soups (we both chose egg drop), a large choice of appetizers (we HAD to have our favourite lettuce leaves served with a chicken/watercress mixture - delightful!), an extensive choice of main dishes (we had crispy honey shrimp and cashew chicken - yummy), dessert could be shared or you could pay extra for an individual portion.
The servers were attentive and friendly.  Our water glasses were kept topped up and our plates removed as soon as we had finished with them.
The only advice I would give - come hungry.  The portions are generous.  I would also suggest you come to an agreement on sharing a dessert.  Our server told us the portions were not big - yikes!  I struggled to finish the citrus dessert and my friend reluctantly gave up on the chocolate mousse cake."
"Just loved PF Chang's as a coeliac, they have and entire section that is gluten free. The food was delicious and the service was great."
"The food was beautifully presented, tiny little spring rolls, I mean tiny, expensive, little spring rolls, and lamb so spicy I wasn't sure if it was lamb. The wait staff was personable, but we started to feel like we were getting the bums rush as soon as our food arrived."
Sautéed spinach was watery and garlic wasn't fresh.  Fried rice with beef was edible.  Not horrible but probably would have tasted better with some alcohol
"Very clean, good food, and sizable portions. If I had to be critical...the waiter did leave me with a dry glass for a little while. I probably wouldn't have noticed though had I not bit into a really hot pepper (it was good, but whew it was hot). Otherwise he was pretty good."
"This a famous chain of chinese restaurant in the USA.
The food quality here was excellent like any other PF Chang's."
After being ill from the buffet was afraid to eat. First time p f changs. Excellent. Fresh food. Tastey. Will always go back and recommend to ALL
"The banquet room was nice with seating for 20+ easily. The room was quiet. Other than that it was standard PF Chang's fare. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Getting drinks from the bar was slow, but it was during CES so they were clearly busy."
"We had dinner here when in LV in August and loved it. The food was first class, really tasty and fresh. To top it all, it was very reasonably priced for a family of 3 (can't recall cost but was pleasantly suprised when we got the bill). Overall our favourite meal while in LV. 

Will certainly head here again if in Vegas."
Really nice tasting food at a very reasonable price.  The only bad thing was that we ordered too much food!
"Hubby and I went here to take advantage of their Happy hour. It was more than worth it! We got seated right away our waitress was very friendly and helpful, we had our drinks and food quickly and the prices were great! We decided to come for happy hour, as its cheaper and we were having a late dinner, but the portion sizes of the discounted appies were very filling and quite delicious, so was the cheap beer! We had the lettuce cups, chicken egg rolls and crab wontons... awesome awesome and more awesome.

We didnt manage to return again this trip but will for sure next time, probably for the actual meal next time."
Stopped here for a bite to eat before heading to a show. We arrived in time for happy hour so we sat at the bar; appetizers were discounted in addition to drinks which made it nice. I would plan on another visit to try a full meal sometime
The food was really good. Portion size was good.  Service very good.  Better than P.F Chang's in Charlotte.

"Excellent food. Great service. Service staff was helpful with suggestions. I have been to PF Chang's several times, but my wife had not, so the wait staff was good at talking thru what we would enjoy."
"This is a nice Asian-fusion alternative for dining on the strip, since it is located inside the Planet Hollywood casino. Really nice atmosphere, excellent service and good food. The only reason I am not giving this restaurant a higher rating, is because I though the food was a little too salty for my taste and P.F. Chang's tends to have a limited Vegetarian menu. This was no big deal, because the next time we are in Vegas and nearby, I would eat here again."
"It's ok, not the best chinese restaurant, but price -quality is right for a las vegas strip restaurant."
"2 friends and i had our 1st experience of changs at the beginning of december, all i can say is, WOW.

we were shown to a table upstairs and our waitress took our drinks order, on return with the drinks she informed us that it was happy hour and cocktails were only $6 each, mmm beautiful.
the 3 of us ordered a selection of food and the only thing that was left was some tofu in the hot and sour soup."
"We really fancied Chinese food whilst in Vegas and this place was close to our hotel. We came one evening about 9pm and didn't have to wait for a table. It took quite some time for our server to take our order and bring drinks, but he was ran off of his feet. However, there were other servers not so busy who could have stepped in but didn't. 

The food however, was fantastic. We ordered a chicken dish, a beef dish, some friend rice and egg rolls. I couldn't find a fault in anything. Really tasty, hot and satisfying. Large portions, we couldn't finish it all but they did offer to box it up for us to take home."
Great food and service at this P.F. Chang's! I went with about six other people to this location and we were seated right away (during prime dinner time). Very affordable prices for Las Vegas. Great quality and taste as any P.F. Chang's restaurant. It was a very enjoyable experience. I would definitely go back to this location again.
"I wasn't impressed with the ribs. Too sticky and tough to chew. The service was nice and the waiters friendly and always on time with refills. However, I'll never eat the ribs there again."
"I visited PF Chang's 3 times during my week in Las Vegas.  I love their food; both the quality and variety are great, and the prices are pretty good.  Servers were attentive, friendly and helpful.  This place is clearly a favorite of many people; it was packed almost every time I passed by.  In the evenings this restaurant was almost a ""victim of its own success"", with wait times of 1 hour or more.   (They conveniently provide pagers for those patient enough to stay.)  However, before evening the delays were much more moderate, so I'd suggest visiting between 11am-noon or 2pm-4pm."
"P.F. Changs is to Chinese food what Olive Garden is to Italian food.... my apologies to Olive Garden lovers.... but neither is this an Italian restaurant.....bland bland bland.

Pot sticker alright, ribs all right, wonton, tasteless, 'beef a la Sichuan'.... we'll pass, black bean chicken, so hard you could play hockey with the chicken, Moo goo gai pan, ridiculous...

First and last time there...."
"Centrally located in Planet Hollywood, weasy to drop in for a quick bite.  Hubby was playing at the table and didn't really want to take a long break to eat.  Quick service and delicious food.... PF Chang never fails to impress!"
"My goodness what a wonderful treat it was at P F Changs. My wife and I stayed at  Planet Hollywood and thought we'd give the resident Chinese a try, so pleased we did! From the gorgeous dynamo shrimp to the fantastic spicy chow mein I could not fault the meal. Just how a Chinese should taste, staff extremely attentive too, this is how customer service should be."
"Robin was our server. My husband dished a lot out and she took it in stride and gave it right back! Every time she left the table he thought of something else he wanted and yelled out ""Robin!"" She would come back to the table with a priceless look on her face and listen to him AGAIN! She read us so well! We got much more than EXCELLENT food and service! Robin made it a fun, memorable experience! Thank you Robin! We hope you had an awesome trip home and enjoyed your holiday and well deserved time off! We will be back!

I have seen reviews that the portions are small and where PF Chang was compared to Panda Express. I strongly disagree! We always have enough to eat, share AND take home. (We are not small people!) I can always name all the ingredients in my mouth with dishes from PF Changs because the food is not over cooked. If good Chinese food means you shouldn't be able to distinguish between the flavors then yes go somewhere else.

We expect the best food at PF Changs this time we also got a witty server...priceless!!!"
"We can always count on P.F.Chang's to deliver a good meal and today was no different!   Service was great and so was the food!  We ordered Chicken Noodle Soup, Chicken Salada nod Sesame Chicken. All were great!,"
"Busy place, seated quickly,drinks well made (and reasonably priced for Las Vegas), Prix Fixe meal for two lots of selections to choose from and each choice excellent. Service top notch."
"We always enjoy eating at P.F Chang's when staying at PH. The service is excellent, the portions are generous, the drinks are great and the food is very tasty.

Our last trip we ate two dinners there and were very satisfied with both. We will return..."
"all food are great, service is so professional, awesome, great location, nice taste, I loved it, my friends loved it"
"Restaurant was very clean, entree's were hot and very good and services good.I was not feeling well so went in for some soup and it made it all better.  I have been to a lot of PF changs restaurants  and this one never disappoints"
"Maybe this is the way Chinese food is supposed to taste when you don't have any Asians involved in its preparation.  I definitely have found a drop in quality since I first came to this Planet Hollywood location (then the Aladdin) seven years ago.  My son ordered from the Gluten Free menu and they brought him a wheat flour-based dish by mistake.  To some people with Celiac disease, this could be sickening and dangerous!  Instead of crediting us, they decided to re-make the dish (which took another 15 minutes), which my son no longer wanted.  Overall, the service was fair at best.  Only the Hot and Sour Soup was worth mentioning.  PF Changs should get its act together before expanding to every shopping mall in North America."
"Good service, good food. Just like every other PF Chang's I've visited in the past. Would recommend if you want something quick and familiar during a long stay in Vegas."
"Was wandering around on my own, fancied a bite so popped in here and sat at the counter. I have been in here a few times and like the atmosphere and the staff are really friendly. A couple of glasses of wine and some ok fried rice/sweet and sour chicken etc and i was $50 down, a lot i thought for what it was but - hey ho. I always say this when i eat here but i always go back which is the real review of a place i suppose."
Can always depend on P.F. Changs to provide great Chinese food! The lettuce wraps are a very tasty way to start your meal. The Almond Cashew Chicken is my all time favorite entree. Never miss a chance to enjoy this dining experience!
"This restaurant looks fantastic but unfortunately was lacking in the taste department. Our server was attentive and got our food out quick (we had a show to catch). Portions were generous, as we've come to expect in the States. The food just wasn't any good - I'd be surprised if the chefs were Chinese. As we were leaving the restaurant, I noticed that there were hardly any Chinese patrons. A sign perhaps?"
We decided to try PF Chang's on our first night in Las Vegas. It was really good. They must teach their waiters very well because i don't like spicy food so they can tame it down. they show you how to use the sauces. I did have some spicy chicken which our waiter made a little less spicy. I saw other waiters showing the other tables how to mix the sauce. I can't wait to go back.
"Stopped on way to show, block off strip, no waiting.  Food reasonable, orders are large enough for sharing, and served family style."
"Having been coming to vegas for years but always seem to leave this restaurant out. On a friends recommendation we decided to try it and am glad we did.
The service was excellent, with the waitress explaining in detail the menu and suggesting dishes that we may like. 
My husband had pad thai which he said was very good and I had the honey prawns, equally yummy.
When we had finished the manager kindly gave us a $20 gift card to use at the restaurant next time we were in town. We felt this was a really nice touch and unusual in Vegas.

Looking forward to dining here again when we are next in wonderful Vegas."
"A chain (we ate at the Vegas on in Green Valley) - but the service was very attentive and the food service was timely and the quality was great. We had a lovely meal - drinks were strong, food was spicy - not much more to ask for. Helped that the waiter was actually a great guy and made the evening fun and personal. We keep coming back - and will continue to do so. The seared tuna appetizer was the best!"
"We ate here after arriving in Vegas on Monday afternoon and spending some time walking the strip.  It is one of my wife's favorite restaurants so we figured it would be great in Vegas too which it was just what we expected, but what we really liked was the waiter and how much information he gave us on things to do, casinos to gamble for the non high rollers etc.  we sat right out on the patio overlooking the strip so it was great people watching.  The food was just what you get from PF Changs back in Dallas"
"We recently visited P.F Changs at the Planet Hollywood resort. It was our first visit to a P.F. Changs anywhere, typically we don't visit chain restaurants but friends who we were with suggested going there.

Anyhow we had a really great experince, great selection of Asian dishes served family style, staff were friendly and they have a really nice atmosphere.

We will definetley be back!!"
We had dinner on a Sunday evening. The menu was quite extensive but very reasonable and the waitrons very helpfull . We had ordered starters I had porkribs and have never seen such a huge portion as a starter more like a main meal but really very tasty. So our main meal was really wasted as we were both too full!! Our waitress said as their patrons normally order for the table they always serve big portions so the family or friends can all try the different dishes! Would definitely go back as it was all very tasty and good value!
"lovely food freshly prepaed food, excellent pager system so you can carry on gambling whilst waiting for your table, not overly priced, good value for money, very busy with a lively atmosphere, if you're looking for a quiet romantic table ask to be seated upstairs would recomend this restaurant we've eaten here twice now, once in 2009 & now in 2013 and each time the food quality and service quality were very good"
"During my visit in Las Vegas - I was able to dine at PF Chang.  The food and service was excellent.  I am not a vegetarian, but was very impressed the selection of vegetarian dishes."
"During my stay in Vegas, I had an opportunity to eat at PF Chang.  The food and service was excellent.  I would definitely recommend dining there."
"The food was good, not great, the service was good, not great.  The ambiance was good, not great. We had the lunch menu, so portions were a bit smaller. Our waitress seemed a tad distracted and not super attentive to us, but no major flubs, she was obviously a pro. Can't say the food was that spectacular, but we didn't order anything outside of the ordinary American Chinese restaurant fare.  At the lunch prices this meal was about as reasonable as you can expect in Vegas."
We went in for a late dinner. From the moment we walked through the door we were treated like royalty. The service was great and the food was just as good. The prices are quite reasonable and the selection is great. We had a very good time and I would highly recommend you give this place a try. We will definitely go back.
"We were happy to learn there was a PF Changs in the Planet Hollywood Resort, as we were staying at the Hilton Grand Elara. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waiter had a big smile and a great attitude. We ordered a few of our favorites and tried a new dish. Everything was quite yummy—consistent with all of our other PF Changs experiences. :)"
"When I visit the States I always check to see if there is a P.F. Chang's.  We had a great dinner, as usual.  Lots of choices.  Love the chicken lettuce wraps.  
Always a great choice.  The waiter pointed out the happy hour specials and we were able to try more dishes and spent less over all.
My girls love this restaurant chain too and we choose this chain first."
"After dining at several casino restaurants, we decided to try a good old standby in PF Changs and it did not disappoint. The food is always excellent and there is always plenty of it. The service at this particular PF Changs was simply wonderful and our waiter went above and beyond to male sure all our needs were met."
"Had dinner at P.F. Chang's, husband and I shared the four course dinner, it included soup, appy, two mains with rice, and dessert. Everything was delicious, the lettuce wraps were amazing. My only complaint - not enough veg - a little meat heavy.  For you GF people, they have a pretty large portion of the menu dedicated to gluten free. Was busy, but we didn't wait for a table, and our food came out very fast. Would go again in a minute for those lettuce wraps!"
"We were recommended this place by a fellow Aussie..and boy, we were not disappointed...service was amazing, food was also amazing and we left satisfied.."
"We have always enjoyed this location in the past. Stopped in around 10pm after Cirque show. Got menus and seated. Then we sat for about 5 min with no contact. Had a chance to read the menu and found that Mushu Pork no longer on menu, almost no pork dishes anymore. Still no contact,so we hit the road. No more Ching for Chang..........."
"Got seated within 15 minutes.  Visited on a Tuesday night at 6:30pm and sat upstairs in booth with strip view.  Atmosphere and view are great.  Busy but not overly noisy.  Waitress was dry but timely with drinks and needed items.
  It was my Wife and I.  Shared The lettuce wrap appetizer, and Dan Dan Noodles main course.  Had 2 cocktails.  Everything was consistently good across the board.  If you haven't eaten here, the main course portions can be pretty huge.  Ask your server before you order.  The $12 Dan Dan noodles is enough for 3 average people to share with an appetizer.  Alcohol drinks are a bit overpriced.  Location is great."
"Great food! My sister and I went for Happy Hour and were delighted at the variety and service. We were so happy with the food and service and the fact that the restaurant is non-smoking, we booked a huge family dinner the next week and everything was amazing."
"While not gourmet food (as, say, Zuma), this restaurant has creative and yummy Chinese food (with some non-Chinese Asian items sprinkled across the menu for good measure, such as pho and not-so-spicy Korean chili chicken drumsticks). We loved the Mandarin chicken and enjoyed the Asian take on a Waldorf salad. Excellent desserts and cocktails, too!"
Last night in Vegas and all wanted something different and light. Chang's was chosen and boy did it fit the bill. Food was great along with the wait staff and once again the portions were large. We all chose different items so we could pass around. This was a great idea and would recommend as you get a wonderful variety and you will still have food to take home. Will definitely go again.
"I really enjoyed the food here.  It wasn't 5 star dining but good texture, appearance and taste.   However I was irritated by the fact that every other person around me was enjoying their entree's before I even got my appetizer.  I was the first person in my section and very hungry so I was expecting to be served quickly.   It was about a half hour before I saw my appetizer and the people who arrived in my section 10 or 15 minutes after me were finishing up their dinners before I even got a taste."
I ate here with some colleagues yesterday. Servers were great and food was excellent. Meals are large so don't over order. I had Kung Pao Shrimp which was excellent. Prices were also good for a strip location
After walking the strip for awhile we stopped in and ate at P.F Chang's this was my first time eating at one and let me tell you....I will come back! Our server Carlos was awesome he got all our orders right and he handled our sense of humor really well. 6 of us went and we all were not disappointed with our meals! It was my birthday and Carlos got me a piece of cake and he made sure we enjoyed ourselves!
"We ate here one evening and were pleased to sit out on the deck overlooking the strip and Bellagio fountains.  What a fun way to enjoy Vegas, see lights, and eat yummy food! FUN!"
"The restaurant is large and had no wait!  It seemed to be run very well, other servers helped each other which is always nice to see! The service was excellent and the food was delicious!"
"Everything we had here was great.  Food and service were first rate.  There was a bit of a wait, but so worth it..."
"Went for happy hour and supper and both times were awesome appetizers and food, lettuce wraps and salt and pepper shrimp are delicious, servers very personable and good at their jobs, and fast service"
"My girlfriend and I went for lunch one of the days that we were staying on the strip. It was very enjoyable. The staff was extremely friendly. Several people engaged us in conversation about where we were from, taste preferences, etc, from the manager to our server to the girl who seated us. They gave both my girlfriend and I gift cards since it was our first time there.  The food itself was pretty good. I am of asian descent and I found their version of some dishes there pretty interesting. The spiciness and various sauces they provide add to the flavour. Great experience overall; beautiful decor, friendly staff and tasty food. Pretty much all you can ask for in a midday meal."
"My wife and I ate here twice during the week of Oct. 20-26, 2013. What an awesome place for dinner. Located in Planet Hollywood this restaurant offers 2 floors of seating inside or you can eat outside next to the strip. The prices are reasonable considering the location.  I would recommend sitting on the second floor as it offers a view of Las Vegas Blvd especially if you sit at the window table. Having lived in South East Asia several years back, it is difficult to find a Chinese restaurant which can duplicate the flavor of the dishes I ate overseas. P.F. Chang’s comes the closest. The food was exquisite. On our two visits my wife ordered the Beef and Broccoli and Sesame Chicken  while I had the Mongolian Beef (I requested it be spiced up a bit) and the Pepper Steak. All dishes were well prepared and the flavor was awesome. This has to be the best Chinese food I have tasted in the United States. I highly recommend anyone visiting Las Vegas to eat here."
"I hate that I am so bad with names. However, the service we received at PF Changs was great. We had the Asian Pear Mojito that was recommended by our server. She said it was one of her favorite drinks. We can see why. It was really good. She was very familiar with the menu and helpful. A definite stop again on our next trip."
This PF Changs is always busy so its better to make reservations ahead of time. We have always just waited and its always been worth the wait. Great food and great service!!
"You certainly get what you pay for, and in my case... not very much.  I ordered Korean chicken ($11) lollypops as an entree. The chicken was well cooked and crispy, but lacked the tangy flavour that was expected. Overall a good entree, but not sure how ""Korean"" it was. It more closely resembled chicken buffalo wings camouflaged as popsicles.  

The mains was, however nothing to write home about. A standard sweet and sour pork ($14) with steamed rice.  The rice was not ""sticky rice' as one would expect in a Chinese restaurant, but rather undercooked flaky rice (basmati perhaps?).  The pork was not very tasty and literally resembled cubed pork which have been deep fried.  The sauce and the colour was not as appetising as I have experienced from other PFC's.  I could not finish this meal and stopped halfway through.

However you cannot beat the value for money.  If you don't mind the flaky taste, then you will be blown away with a handsome portion of food which will not cost you an arm and a leg.  My total bill was $25 for an entree and mains.  Good value indeed."
"After a few drinks we decided to feast on some Chinese for lunch. We sat at the bar and had Shawn as our bartender who courageously put up with our antics. He was delightful!! We had a dish that was similar to the General Tso (forgot name of dish) and the sweet and sour chicken dish and both were wonderful! We capped it off with a tiramisu that was just as amazing!  

Thanks for putting up with us Shawn!! 
Sean (correct way ;-) and Steph"
"I had a wonderful meal, drinks and appetizers here with my friends. It was packed, busy, but, service and fast and friendly.  The food was wonderful and tasty.  Food here is always served with distinction and has it's own style so different than local mom and pop chinese.  I always choose PF Chang if there is one nearby.  Also try Pei Wei if there is one near you.  If is also owned by PF Chang and if the fast food Bistro version.  Also excellent."
One of the best gluten free menu's on the strip. My kids love eating the mongolian beef mixed with some plain ole' white rice.
"My review title is my biggest tip for this restaurant. it is very busy. i feel if you were in the centre of it you would not be able to relax. you are going to spend some $$ on dinner so you should be in a position to enjoy it. Luckily we were given a corner table so we could watch the rush of the place from a distance. PF Chang's is consistent for sure. we have had meals in several of their locations so we know what to expect. our wait staff was pretty attentive to us (only two of us dining compared to some other larger groups). Lettuce wraps are excellent. the plate sizes are Vegas-size so unless you have a cooler in your room, you are going to be leaving food behind."
This is NOT your $5 or under Chinese Food place.  The pricey Asian inspired dishes were well prepared and a nice change from the typical fare found in the average Chinese food place.
"We wanted something good, fast, and easy. Returned to Chang's, which we are familiar with, and had what we wanted."
"PF Chang's one of the best restaurants that I have been too. Its not the cheapest places to eat, however, but it wont break the bank. 
Good service, Good food, Good atmosphere.... cant complain."
"First time trip and I am hooked. Very clean, great atmosphere and excellent service. Only drawback is the bathroom is inside the casino, but it's not a big deal."
Great food and fast service!  The staff was very attentive.  Most restaurants in Las Vegas are crowded and staff is inattentive.  Not the case here!
A waiter got a cloth that was on his shoulder and dried the floor and used the same cloth to clean a table. I wished I hadn't seen that!
"Awesome food at a reasonable price.  We went for lunch and only had a 10 min wait.  Definitely recommend trying the lettuce wraps, they were awesome!"
This chain restaurant caused me a terrible bout of gout from just a simple lunch. There must have been a ridiculous amount of sodium and who knows what else in their food.
Enjoyed our evening very much.  Five of us looking for a special meal.  Prompt service and knowledgable staff.  Very good food.  Easy to make the reservation.
"Ate lunch here at the Planet Hollywood and I can't say enough.  Food was superb, fresh, and as someone with allergy issues, the menu provided me with plenty of options.  Service was excellent."
"Our meals were very good, but the staff here Amazed my wife and I. The waitress was delightful, welcoming us to Las Vegas and explaining the menu to us. We were visited by the Manager, who asked how our meals were, and in our discussion, I asked about a Military Discount. He said that he would be sure we got one.
After enjoying our meals, we were surprised to see a 20% discount! This kind of personal attention made us return the next night as well. Again we were visited by BOTH managers, and received the same discount."
"Loved the food here, was all awesome!

We ate here on the first day and although one item took a while to arrive the friendliness of the staff and the atmosphere more than made up for it. Before the end of the meal the manager brought over gift cards for us to apologize for the delay but they really didn't need to.

Try the dumplings and lettuce wraps!"
"Ate lunch here at the Planet Hollywood and I can't say enough.  Food was superb, fresh, and as someone with allergy issues, the menu provided me with plenty of options.  Service was excellent."
One of the best gluten free menu's on the strip. My kids love eating the mongolian beef mixed with some plain ole' white rice.
Great food and service.  If you are after a fast and cheap eat you can check out this restaurant.  They have a happy hour I think 4 - 6 and its priced really well!
"I chose to eat at this place before we went to the airport. We waited 10 mins before being seated. Our waiter was fast on drinks. One person in our party had not eaten here so they gave him a $10 gift card which was nice. Food was good, service was great."
"My husband and I had a late lunch here on Oct. 10th.   There was a small wait, but the line moved quickly.  The food was wonderful and plentiful - the flaming red wontons are in my opinion the best I have ever had, and the prices are very reasonable.   The only negative was the service.  We had one of the most awful waiters we've ever had in a restaurant.   We don't like to give bad reviews because everyone has a bad day but from beginning to end he was completely disorganized.   He took our order quickly, gave us drinks & soup, and then came back 10 minutes later to tell us he forgot to write our order down (which was incorrect - we watched him write it) and could we give it to him again.  The food finally came but he never came back until we were finished, so no more cocktails for us.   He finally brought the check, and after he took our credit card came back about 8 minutes later to ask us if he brought us the check. Really??  We had an uncomfortable moment of pause wondering what it was he did with our credit card!   He realized that he gave it to a manager and went & got it.   The odd part was that he had the least amount of table to wait on than the other waiters!"
"Delicous lettuce wraps, as any P.E. Chang's has, nice wine list and happy hour coctails.  Busy, but we enjoyed it for a quick drink and snack."
"This restaurant , no matter which location, is always great, but in particular I have always had great service, in addition to the always great food, at this location in Planet Hollywood. There were 9 people in our party and the waiter had everything we wanted, when we wanted it, and how we wanted it. Can't beat it."
I recently visited a Changs. I got the Shrimp & Rice from the lunch menu. The portion was larger than expected and very good. However it did come with soup that I did not like (Very thick like gravy ). Otherwise a wonderful place I will be going to again. Minus the soup!
Enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere. My favourite meal was the Mongolian beef. Pairs great with the shrimp.  Best appetizer is the Chicken wraps(lettuce).  Love the food!  We were with a couple of friends and shared everything.  Great meal!
They were FAST on room service and as always the quality was excellent.  We were at Planet Hollywood and they serve this hotel!
"I've been to PF Changs a number of times in other places.  I went for dinner here and it was OK.  The food was fine, albeit a little on the bland side.  I got the impression that since it was so busy, the cooks were in such a hurry that they do not have the time to really prepare the food.  I did not get the feeling that I was rushed out the door but I did get the feeling that the food could have been better."
If you don't eat here you are missing out! My husband and I make a point of going here. Vegas is not Vegas without a visit to PF Changs! Their lettuce wraps and deep fried green beans are a must and the Dan Dan is to die for. Just Amazing! It is quick service and great food that is reasonably priced. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
The food here is incredible got the shrimp in lobster sauce and the sesame chicken. You've got to try it. I would recommend booking cause we ended up sat at the bar however this was great as we met some really interesting people and got some gambling tips!
Wish we had nice Asian food like this in Australia! Real breast chicken and the lettuce wraps are yummy!
"My fiance stopped by here for lunch when we were in Las Vegas and it was delicious! We ended up splitting a lunch entree and an appetizer and it was the perfect amount of food. Portions here are relatively large and if you don't want leftovers I would definitely suggest sharing a meal. Great food and great service, I would definitely go here again!"
"The restaurant was very busy and we were just glad to get a table. The service was good and the food arrived fairly fast. Only everything we ordered appeared to be fried in batter and the covered in different sauces. We we we served our starters my wife saw the waitress clutch her belly and seemed to be in a bit of discomfort.  I thought to myself "" hope its not the food thats done that"" only to be told by the new waitress that she had gone into labour. Overall it was ok, but not fantastic."
"This is the third PF Chang’s I have eaten at and they never disappoint me. We had an outstanding dinner…very plentiful and exquisite plates. We took someone who is not exactly a Chinese food fan and he was really delighted. 
You have to try the Shrimp Candled Walnuts…simply delicious. They serve big plates so if you have an order of fried rice and a couple of other plates 4 people can eat easily.

Don’t miss this…if they are packed it’s really worth the wait!"
"Birthday dinner at PF Chang's Planet Hollywood, great food, great service, happy days! Lots of food and really good value, definitely worth a visit!"
Service was excellent. Egg drop soup was bad. Someone spilled another soup in it and combination was terrible but everything else was delicious
Great pan seared shrimp dumplings and amazing Chilean Sea Bass. Service was excellent. Great casual dining experience.
"Lovely food. Lots of it and relatively cheap for the amounts. Go hungry or order one between two as we ordered too much and there was loads left!!
Lovely place, friendly staff. Definitely recommend a visit!"
We ate here to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday and our waiter made it a very memorable meal.  He helped us with amounts to order and food selections.  The service was fantastic and not over bearing.
"Many travelers dislike restaurant chains, however, there is comfort in seeing a sign for a PF Changs in the midst of the Vegas Glitz and Glitter.  We went for dinner after a day of traveling and unpacking. It was conisistent with the quality and service we expected.  We shared Steamed Pork Dumplings, Spare Ribs and Crispy Fried Beans and Mandarin Chicken. Each dish was excellent.  The service was great and we ate outside which is right on the strip."
"Recently spent 4 days in Vegas for a meeting and trade show.  I went to multiple restaurants, but had my best meal was at PF Chang.  They were very busy - but I understand why!  The food was great, I had good service, and the price was right.  This is the second PF Chang I have eaten at - the other in Scottsdale -- both had great food.  Enjoy."
"Food was amazing! We had the crab rangoon, egg rolls, sesame chicken, & crab fried rice and all were absolutely amazing!! Huge portions though, definitely enough to share. Took awhile for food to come out though because they have a bunch of carryout orders to fill on top of a full restaurant."
It is pretty much middle of the strip so right in the middle of things. Sat outside and could see the fountain show across the street. It was beautiful at night. Abit pricey but pretty much all things are in Vegas. Food excellent and good waitstaff.
I would have given it 5 stars but the sauteed string beans were not cooked enough and were crunchy. The other items we had were very tasty. I could tell that everything was of good quality and very fresh. Service was excellent.
"I just wrote a review for the PF chang's on paradise road in Las Vegas and like I said this is one of the best restaurants for great food, awesome costumer service and excellent location.  

I have never been let down and I have been to Las Vegas 16 time over  the last 7 years,  PF Chang's is one of the best, you have my word."
"We waited 45 minutes to get a table and in hindsight, we should have gone somewhere else. 
The food was simply lousy. Every dish was bland and excessively gooey. 
The curry was probably the worst I have ever had anywhere in the world. I don't even think the chef used any of the spice. 
The service was non-existent. Maybe it was due to the fact that it was Saturday. I am not sure.
The only redeeming point was the low cost of the beer and that they had some craft beer available. 
I will never come back to this restaurant and would never recommend it."
"It was just like any other PF Chang's. However, the service was terrible and we almost got up and walked out before a server even asked if we wanted anything to drink."
Food is great.  Very reasonably priced so value is always there.   Service was great.   We ate at the bar and all three of the bartenders were looking after us.
"We enjoyed the food and experienced great service during our recent visit.  Chose the deal that gives you each a soup, appetizer to share, 2 entrees and dessert to share for around $45.  We chose egg drop soup, lettuce wraps, mongolian beef, almond and cashew chicken and blueberry cheesecake.  I would rate all of them above average with a special mention to the lettuce wraps which were excellent.  The lettuce pieces were really large, washed and not mangled.  Really nice and easy to eat out of when they're that way.  Server was helpful and attentive and kept us in water throughout the meal.  All in all, just a really great way to start an evening."
I must say that each time I've gone to PFchangs the customer service makes me want to continue to go back any time I want Asian Infused cuisine. The food is also amazing and must say the bananas and ice cream there for dessert is a must have after a meal.
"Went with a group of 4 before a show. we got there around 3pm. I wasnt expecting much, however this place looked nice inside. We decided on a few dishes and we would share family style. I was blown away of the quality of the food. We ordered Mongolian Beef and Changs Spicy chicken, these were spectacular. Also had crab wontons and a noodle dish. these too were very good. We were there for 8 days and ate at some high end expensive restaurants. This was one of the best meals we ate. All 4 of us were full after the meal and the bill was just over $60.00. Well worth the price. We will return on our next trip to Las Vegas."
"When ever we get a chance we go to the one on Rampart and Charleston. There food is always the best and service is great. If you have to wait at least 30-45 minutes for a table any night of the week, you must be in the right place for quality food and service."
"Not great, not bad, just fine. The cost wasn't too inflated. The location is great. The food wasn't better than any other Chinese take out I get here at home. They maybe were understaffed, everyone seemed very rushed there."
"We don't have PF Changs here, and I had heard fabulous things so my expectations were high. This place exceeded my expectations of delcious asian food. #1 recommendation - try the mongolian beef, it is to die for.
We liked it so much, we changed our plans to come back and have it a second time before we left vegas :)"
"Excellent food, went with family 2 adults and 2kids. They all loved it, especially the kids. There non alcoholic juices (esp the coconut one) were fabulous"
"We love PF Changs and everytime we visit Vegas we always come here, food and service is amazing however challenge is how to get in!! Yes this place is just way too busy. This time when we called they said we are not taking reservations and then we arrived they told us there is one hour wait and after 45mins when I went again inside to ask how long they said another 45 mins which is ridiculous!! we ended up eating some buffet restaurant in Planet Hollywood, we could not wait any longer since we had to catch a show later on. So if you are planning to go then make sure you go alot earlier to avoid frustration!!"
"Good service, many many choices of Asian fusion cuisine, loved everything about it. Our waiter was very kind, making good suggestions and even at one point bringing us a complimentary drink..."
"Chose this place as we fancied a lighter meal as a break from all the fried foods we'd been bombarded with!
Nice enough restaurant, service was fine, prices were very reasonable, especially for Vegas.
However, imagine my disappointment when my prawn pad thai turns up... and the prawns are battered and deep fried! Hardly authentic Thai food!
None of it was unpleasant, and it is good value for money, but I have had far better Asian food."
Purchased takeaway and it was as dry as the desert - did you forget my sauce Mr Chang!! Husband quite enjoyed his meal but he is easily pleased.
Great chinese food! Chicken lettuce wraps and steamed dumplings were lovley. Service was great and left satisfied.
Unfortunately we were pushed for time when we went here but the food we had was very good and the waiter very helpful. We should of realised though that the portions would be large and therefore could of ordered one less dish. We were asked whether we would like to take the leftovers with us but as we were off to the theatre it wasn't advisable.
If you are ever near a PF Changs please try and attend. Their dynamite shrimp are are awesome. Every time we have been there they have brought out a free dish to share and this time was no exception. For all this good food the prices are always reasonable and very good value.
Great chinese food! Chicken lettuce wraps and steamed dumplings were lovley. Service was great and left satisfied.
"Me and my mate visited here on a night in Vegas, after reading reviews, I was interested in going and we got a table straight away.

We ordered our drinks at table, upon those arriving we ordered our food. My starter appeared first without my mates, he said for me to start so I did, I had finished my starter then the main course arrived straight away.... still waiting for my mates starter to arrive.

my mate's starter arrived AFTER our main courses arrived - due to a backlog in the kitchen.... not acceptable.

besides this fault, it was a nice meal."
"This is a must whenever we are in Vegas - and we tell everyone who is going to Vegas - PF Changs is a MUST - no question about it.  Good rule of thumb, order an appetizer or 2 and then pretty much 1 dish per person and you will have more than enough food.  The pricing is fantastic for the quality of food and service.  It cost our group of 4  $84 US for supper.  Their lettuce wraps are so good, and their Mongolian Beef is unbelievable, fresh, tender and so tasty.  We have been visiting PF Changs every time we are in Vegas and have seriously never been disappointed once.  You might have to wait a bit to get in without a reservation, but believe me it is well worth the wait.  

Anyone we have recommended to try it there - always come back saying how great it was."
"We had a great meal here on our last night in Vegas.  I have always wanted to eat at PF Chang's so it made sense to eat here as we were staying at Planet Hollywood.  The service was very quick.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  The menu was massive and the wine list was also much larger than I was expecting.  I ended up getting the Honey Prawns, which were very good and cooked perfectly.  Coming from the UK I found it fantastic that you could get brown rice along with your dish (usually it's just white rice).  The food came within minutes and was pipping hot.  As a whole the pricing was excellent and felt that we got good value for money.  All in all is was a great experience and I would happily go back."
"My wife and I dined here on September 6th.  I generally don't post reviews.about chain restaurants but opted to do so because of the particularly excellent service we received. We have dined at PF Changs around the country. The food is always very good.  During this visit, my wife's order arrived over cooked.  Even our server agreed after my wife politely called it to his attention   It took a while for her order to be prepared so in the meantime I proceeded to eat my entree. Fortunately she already had an appetizer so she wasn't starving. We didn't grumble or grouse about any of this. Mistakes happen.  However, the manager cameo over to check on us, apologized and informed us there would be no charge for my wife's entree or the lettuce wrap appetizer which was delicious.  I would expect this kind of customer treatment in a non tourist city which substantially depends on repeat customers for its business.  However, I was impressed that we would receive such exemplary service in Las Vegas because we were mere tourists.  I compliment the manager and the PF Chang administration for appreciating its customers."
"On a recommendation by a work colleague, came here for dinner.
Surprised by the variety on the menu so chose crab fried rice, kung pow scallops and chicken and ginger with broccoli.
Well, three tasty dishes arrived. Fried rice had nice chilli tang to it along with chunks of crab meat and asparagus spears - and no peas or carrots which are often used by Chinese restaurants as 'fillers'. No skimping on the quantity of scallops in the kung pow dish. Chucks of tender chicken breasts and crispy fresh broccoli for the last dish.  All very yummy.  Highly recommended and will come here again if opportunity allows.

Service by Aaron the waiter was nothing short  of exceptional. Not in your face but constant enough with checking if more drinks etc were needed."
"Always enjoy going to a PF Changs when in area that has one. This visit did not disappoint as food was excellent and served quickly at lunch time hour. Our server, Benjamin, was very personable and funny and gave us tips on shows and other restaurants to try during our trip to Vegas. Meal for two was under $31.00. Try it...its a level or two up from your normal Chinese fare and you get good sized portions."
"I just LOVE ASIAN food....I had been to PF Chang's before, but this restaurant was so much ""awesomer"". The atmosphere was out of this world! The service was stupendous also. Would definitely return to this restaurant!"
"WOW, even the burgers are amazing!!  That is what we had on this past trip, and the desserts are delicious!  The quality is supurb!"
"We didn't expect too much from PF Changs, I just thought it would just be a big standard Chinese food chain meal (a bit like I imagine Panda Express is). WRONG!!
We had spring rolls to start with a ""make your own sauce"". Followed by Mongolian beef and Honey chicken. Not only did it look lovely but it tasted gorgeous! Not greasy or fatty like a run of the mill Chinese. Drinks were a reasonable price and the final bill a bit of a bargin. The service was great and the food even greater, for a decent Chinese at an affordable price, give it a try!"
"Nice central location on the strip.

We had a nice drink at the bar by friendly barmen. 

Shown quickly to the table. Friendly waiter, prompt service and good food .... Just like you expect from this chain

The interior and ceiling of this 1 are very impressive

Good experience ... Would return"
"Food was seasoned, spicy and sassy.  We enjoyed all, service was prompt and personable.  We referred two other couples to PF Changs the next evening."
"It seems that this restaurant is always busy but the wait times aren't too bad and it's worth the wait! Besides, they give out pagers so you can go to the casino while you wait. Reasonably priced for the strip and didn't disappoint. Our group sat upstairs with a nice view of the strip. Service was great."
"Good food at a cheaper price on the strip. Perfect if you want a restraint meal at cost. Don't expect class, expect what you pay for. The meal was fine, food is good quality. Small waiting time and helpful staff."
"We had a big enough group to reserve the private room towards the back of the restaurant....very nice.

We have been to the restaurant before and this time did not disappoint.  With the advice of our server, we picked items off a menu that was $25 per person.  The food was excellent and our waiter was very attentive."
"Great food, good service. Dislike the waiting list, always a 30 min wait to get seated. They do provide pagers"
"Took a break from more expensive options in Vegas and decided to walk across the road from Bellagio to dine at PF Chang's.  We were not disappointed.  The service was prompt, courteous and our food arrived on time.  PFC never disappoints - portions were large & food quite delicious."
"PF Chang is our fav chain in the USA for Chinese. They are consistently good with the taste and the quality of the food. However, if you are looking for the full experience with outstanding service then I suggest going to the PF Chang's on Paradise Street. Worth the cab fare as they have it well over this one. The service was a bit lacking and the attention no where near as good. Perhaps it was the business of the restaurant or the server but this one let them down a little. It cost us $10 each way with tips for the cab to Paradise and I am happy to do that for the amazing comparison."
"It's hard finding somewhere that offers Gluten Free food, so I love that PF Chang's has a specific menu with choices for me. I love their GF Spicy Chicken."
We have been here two times and play to go back next week. Always great food and great service. Make sure you order the honey dew candied shrimp!!!!!!!!!! YUM
Didn't like the cocktail prices but welcome to Vegas.  Beer prices were okay.  Food as always very good and I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at a PF Changs.  Waiter was friendly and helpful. We arrived on a busy night and they said the wait was about 25 minutes but it was more like 15 minutes which wasn't bad.
"Outstanding Service, food and price! We ordered a variety of plates and loved all of them. the male host was snobby and we almost left to try another place to eat. But we were tired and hot and had to sit and eat. It was the second best meal that we had in Vegas."
"FABULOUS!!! as always!!! This Vegas PF Chang's is just as wonderful as our home PF Chang's in North Carolina. Lettuce Wraps, Beef with Broccoli, Spicy Green Beans, and Banana Spring Rolls for dessert...a must!"
"This PF Changes was no different than the one back home.  Only reason why we ate there was for a meeting.  The place is always busy, just like back home, but they just don't do it for me.  For the price, I'd rather find a small Chinese place to eat where you get enough to take home.  Prices are high, ambiance is loud.  Just ok."
"We had PF Chang's brought to the room and it was awesome! Food was amazing. We had the Wonton soup, Cashew Chicken and Broccoli beef. We wondered if the quality would be the same having it brought up but it was perfect."
Staff were efficient and friendly.  Service was good considering how busy tis restaurant is.  Enjoyed our meal.
"PF Chang's is an excellent restaurant with tasty food, large portions, good prices, and generally friendly service at a great location.

My problem with PF Chang's was that the patio was not open. While many restaurants on the strip put a great deal of work into keeping their patios comfortable and open during the hot summer I was told that it was too hot for the staff of PF Chang's. I imagine they lose a lot of business because of this.

Also, the staff at the front were rude and gave me an inaccurate wait time."
"We have been to this PF changs a few times when we come into town. We went during happy hour so had a few of the appetizers very inexpensive. We really like our waiter there who we have had before Shaun. Will be back for sure. Food is good, reasonably priced and service good."
We enjoyed everything about our experience at PF Changs. The server was fantastic and all the others that made their way to the table were also just as helpful and polite and friendly.
Food was tasty and reasonably priced for a higher end Chinese restaurant. We were there several times during our stay at the Planet Hollywood and never had any complaints.
"2 word's,,,,,,LETTUCE WRAPS.....

And to finish it off -- a entre of Chang's Spicy Chicken....
""The Best ""........"
"Every time we visit vegas, it's mandatory that we eat at PF Changs and we haven't been disappointed yet. Great food and value for money. You might want to book otherwise you have to wait, but well worth it. Service is good & quick to bring out the food."
"The people ahead of us had a minor complaint about not being seated promptly but it seems as though the manager took care of them quickly as soon as he heard about the complaint. We were seated shortly after that, the food was great. The atmosphere was great. Our server was even greater! He got wind that my husband was celebrating his 50th Birthday and tells my husband to pick out a dessert that he likes, shortly after that he brings the dessert out. Way to make my husband feel valued!"
Its on the strip and very busy but it didnt taste any different than any other chinese food place.   Price reflects location.   I was surprised they didnt know for sure if their food contained MSG or not.   It took a few servers and the manager to decide they dont use the stuff.
"We come here every time we visit Vegas. The staff are always friendly and the food is always lovely. The portions come up big so go on an empty stomach. You get great food and it is very reasonably priced. There is a large selection on the menu, I am a vegetarian and even I am spoilt for choice. Would highly recommend."
"We ate here on a busy weekend in late June and have always enjoyed the food at PF Changs. It was really noisy in the dining hall (due to it's high ceilings design) so it's hard to carry on a conversation. I would'nt choose to eat here for a romantic dinner, but the food is good and we were staying at Elara, right within the Planet Hollywood mall. Should have gotten take out and eaten in our room. The drunk teen at the table next to us was passed out face down in his plate. I finally asked the server to move us rather than risk him eventually vomiting on our plates or shoes."
"This was our first meal in Vegas and it was a good un. Plenty to feed us both, reasonable drinks prices, delicious food."
"We decided to join the rest of our family for dinner, but were not excited about the choice of going here.  We try and avoid big chain restaurants when we can.  Both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by food.  On a previous trip (several years ago for lunch), it was average.  But that has definitely changed.  We ordered sesame chicken, lo mein, and a beef w/scallions (can't remember the name, crab wontons, and spring rolls.  Everything we ordered was excellent.  Pf Changs will definitely be an option dinner on our next trip to Vegas."
"We ate here at almost 10 pm, after it took about an hour to settle on grub.  We were mid-week, and it still took about 1/2 hour to seat us, but that was very reasonable for the Strip, so we went with it.

I can't recommend the service enough!  The servers, hostesses, and even attendants/busers were all helpful, polite, and quick.  Drinks were re-filled, our needs were attended to.

It was remarkable to have such fabulous food, at prices that were much like they are back home.  Not hyper-inflated (just up a little).  And I haven't really been wow'd by the establishment closest to my office, but this location got it right.

The two issues we noticed while dining were the noise level - off the charts - and the tight space between tables.  Hopefully they can expand in the future, to accommodate more diners.  And one last note: The restroom is actually in the casino, a bit of a walk from the restaurant.

(If I were you, I'd put a $1 in the so-called penny slot just out the back door, while you are waiting for a table.  We had fun, and paid for our meal.  Not a bad way to eat in Vegas!)"
This place is AWESOME!!!  Unbelievable food and service for a great price...  open late nights and the location was right on strip..literally
"This PF Changs is located in the plant Hollywood at the strip. Upon arrival we were told we had to wait for about 45-mins for a table for two or we can go upstairs and eat at the bar. Two flights of stairs later we were sat at the bar at the end. The guy running the bar made us feel very welcome and did a great job in keeping our glasses filled and being hospitable. The food was very well prepared, definately one of the better ones we tried recently. Food was also delivered quite fast."
Having been here before we confidently took friends for dinner - the place was buzzing and whilst we had a 20 minute wait it was worth it.  We had a selection of starters the chicken lettuce best I have ever had - it is a huge portion for one! The main dishes of peppered beef and kung po chicken  were both delicious - staff  very friendly and great service - very reasonably priced for great food
"This place is amazing. Waited 40 minutes to be seated but was well worth it.
Our waiter Ernesto was fab. Wasn't too sure what to choose as the menu had such a big choice but he knew the menu inside and out and told us what was the best and it sure was :)
Would definitely come back here again."
"My wife and I stopped here for a late lunch/early dinner while in Vegas. P.F. Chang's China Bistro has outside seating, and since it's in the shade, made for a comfortable evening to people watch. We split an egg roll app and each ordered an entree to share. Each of us had a Sam Summer too. I was pleasantly surprised at the bill for the amount of food and beer we ordered. P.F. Chang's is a national chain, but an enjoyable meal. The servers were attentive, and kept our water glasses full."
"A fan of PF Chang's and ate there twice while at Planet Hollywood in July 2013. Food was, as always above average, and both visits had a good view of the strip."
"dont miss it..they have happy hour for certain food and drinks..( strawberry and cucumber mix is just great and fresh) and you end up having a blast with the friendly staff while eating very good quality shrimps with great flavour..spending cheaper tan back home..try it"" =)"
Our waitress was pretty busy but she did great! Was very attentive and helpful with the menu! The food was excellent!
Dont get me wrong that Pf changs is consistent where ever you go but im rating it a 2.1/5 because the one in Anaheim was way better overall with everything! The food is still good and i recommend it! but like i said Anaheims Pf changs is way better.
"Fancied a Chinese before heading to the Beatles show at the Mirage. Had to wait about 10-15 mins for a table but this wasn't a problem, sat at the bar having a drink while we waited.  Once seated the service was great, our waiter was lovely.  Food was delicious, would definitely eat here again when visiting Las Vegas."
"Other than convenience being located in the hotel, although food was decent, it is overpriced.

For authentic Chinese food at the fraction of the price go to Chinatown on spring mountain road for the real deal for cheap.  It's a quick cab ride away.."
"As I said, food was superb - so much so we went twice in 5 days. Only downside was it was very very busy, and the tables we fairly packed in, so with all the people coming and going and waiters rushing around, it wasn't a very relaxing experience."
"We were a party of four and when we entered the restaurant we were escorted to the upper floor.  We had to climb 2 flights of stairs and were seated in a dark area of the restaurant. No one inquired if we were even able to climb that many stairs.  There were no elevators and in order to use the bathroom, you had to go back downstairs and climb up again.  I did not like the fact that we were told we had to be seated on the second floor.  I noticed that there were several available tables on the main floor when we walked thru to the stairway.  I voiced my complaint/concern, but the staff did not do anything about it.  I was also disappointed in the meal that I ordered which was sesame chicken.  It was very bland and did not have much taste to it.  I've had better sesame chicken in a fast food restaurant.  I would not go back to this particular restaurant.
I must say that our waiter was excellent though."
I love the food at pf changs!!! I like to order something different every time I go and I have never been disappointed with anything I've ever eaten.  Lettuce wraps are out of this world!!! I could have them as my meal instead of an appetizer!  The staff there are real nice and attentive!
"The Happy Hour at PF Chang's is awesome!  The waiters at the bar are super friendly and so efficient.  The food and drink deals are very good, fresh, hot, and delicious.  We always go there when in Vegas and are never disappointed."
"It was an outstanding meal, with attentive wait staff and a great atmosphere. We wish that we had one of these closer to us because we'd love to go again! Get a table up stairs if you can. The views are nice!"
"We always eat at Chang's when in Vegas.  In my opinion, the food isn't as good as it used to be.  The orange beef was ""grainy"" in texture.  Service was excellent as usual.  We had reservations for 7pm but was able to get an earlier table within a 10 minute wait.  In case you didn't know.......you can book a reservation online at their website.  In spite of the orange beef, we'll still visit the Planet Hollywood location again when we are in Las Vegas."
We were celebrating a birthday so they brought out a little desert plate with a lit candle which was a nice touch. Variety of food that come really fast. I would recommend booking in advance.
"The food of course was standard delicious P.F. Chang's food.  Our server was so nice and personable.  With all the celebrity chef and five star restaurants on the strip, it was still worth it to go to this chain favorite."
"good service, generous portions you should share as the portions are very large good selection good location in Planet Hollywood"
"fast service
chicken, broccoli, chashews, the sauces all excellent
very reasonable prices especially considering the area
good atmosphere"
We loved the bar seets! Great service! Good food! Get their signature starter AMAZING! Also very good are the pork dumblings!
"PF Changs is located on the casino floor at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.  The menu is the standard excellence one expects from PF Changs in North America.  Go for the Changs Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Salt and Pepper Spareribs.  I would recommend eating inside and although sitting outside gives you an interesting view of the Strip, the temperature is too high for dining comfort.

Sitting at a nearby table at the restaurant were ballroom dancers Anna Trebunskaya and Mark Roberts from the ABC television show ""Dancing with the Stars"".  They seemed to enjoy their food as well."
Very busy restaurant but didn't have to wait long. Food and service was great.  Reasonably priced and by eating early we had drinks in happy hour.
Great food as usual!! We always try to visit a PF Changs when we are traveling and we find one! Really can't beat the meal deal!!
"I almost always eat at Changs when in Vegas, and this was the best experience I've had. I have a shellfish allergy, and the waiter was very attentive to my needs. He brought out a special menu, went over everything on it and was adamant about making sure the kitchen was aware. It was exceptional service. We had spring rolls for an appetizer, and sweet and sower pork and thai noodles for the main course, and both were top notch. They also make very good mixed drinks. There wasn't any aspect of the meal that didn't exceed expectations, and for the money, it's as good a value as you'll find on the strip. Excellent all around."
Great food and prices and the only place to eat at Planet Hollywood.  While lots of the other Harrah's resorts and restaurants are in decline this restaurant stands out.  They also offer a Happy Hour which is hard to beat for both quality and price. They also have a nice wine selection.
"As an avid Chinese food lover, I was excited to try PF Chang's for the first time. I was let down. The food just didn't have enough flavor for me. Good atmosphere, nice staff, but just didn't cut it for me."
Delicious food and drinks. Drinks a bit on the pricey side. Food portions generous. I had the salt and pepper prawns. They were fab but would advise asking for a different dip than the mustard one offered. Gutted that I could not eat the whole portion
"Like other Changs restaurants, good, solid food! You always know you're going to get a good meal there and best of all, it's inside the Planet Hollywood Casino! Easy to get to, great service."
"PF Changs is great almost anywhere you go but this one is located right off the strip in Planet Hollywood which makes it extremely convenient to get to. The majority of nice restaurants on the strip are very over priced but PF Changs keeps their prices very reasonable and similar to the establishments elsewhere. The service friendliness is a hit or miss. I have eaten here many times and half of the time, the staff is very friendly and nice. The other half, they are trying to rush you out the door before you even sit down and aren't too friendly."
"Had a bunch of appetizers for a late lunch... Happy hour on drinks and appetizers from 3-6pm. Very tasty.... Also had 2 Asian Pear Mohitos, very tasty and refreshing in mid 30 degree heat.... Found this place in April and went again this trip. Both fantastic..."
"Assuming you have been to a PF Changs before, this location will not disappoint. It was easy to make an online reservation a few hours before dinner and even with a lineup out onto the strip, our time was well respected! Service was good and the Mongolian Beef was AMAZING!"
"Great food, whether you like spicy, seafood or just plain interesting. Big Portions, very helpful waitstaff and great drinks. One of the most dependable chains ever."
"Love to eat at PF Changs in Las Vegas, NV.  Love their lettuce wraps.  So tasty.  Great atmosphere.  Friendly Servers.  Sometimes a little 'wait.'....great food."
Even though we said we were not going to eat at a chain restaurant...we did!  It was great.   The staff were very attentive.  Everyone had an awesome time!
We stopped at this PF Chang's for dinner and it was a great experience. The wait staff was very friendly and easy to talk to. The food came out within a matter of minutes after we ordered and was a very reasonable price.
"Each year we visit PF Chang's at Planet Hollywood as our must do whilst in Vegas. The food is superb and the service is second to none. Last year we discovered that they do a lunchtime special, where the process are a little bit cheaper but you get a starter salad and your main course. I always chose the Beef and Broccoli dish. I have never been disappointed. I also have a cocktail that you won't find on the drinks menu, but hidden away on the dessert menu called the Orient Express, oh my gosh, when I sip that first taste its like going to heaven. The drink is Baileys based with Frangelico and the rim of the martini glass is dipped in sugar lemon juice and cinnamon it is divine. Two mains with cocktails usually sets us back around $50 with tip and is worth every penny. This place is always busy and they usually give you a little gadget that buzzes when your table is ready. Worth the wait every time. I cannot praise this place highly enough."
We ate at PF Changs on our last night at Planet Hollywood. It was starting to get dark and we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains! The food was delicious and the portions were quite large. Would eat here again.
We went there for happy hour and that makes it a super good value.  You get great drinks and great food for a great price.  We sat on the upper level overlooking the strip.  Great view for people watching.  Our server was excellent!
"We stopped here for dinner my first night in Vegas this time.  Had a 20 minute wait, so we sat outside to people watch and chat.  Once our pager went off, we were whisked to a table near the back.  Service was courteous and prompt.  We ordered the dynamite shrimp for an appetizer and I had the Szechuan beef and white rice.  

Our appetizer was taking a bit longer than expected, even with the dinner rush, so I asked the water about it.  He promptly went to check on it in the kitchen and told us it would be right out.  In 3-4 minutes the kitchen manager hand delivered it with apologies and said it would be on the house.  That was a bit beyond anything I'd have expected and really set the tone for the rest of the meal.

The rest of the food was impeccable, and the portions were extremely generous.  And I say that as a larger man.  I finished my plate but just barely.  I had a drink with dinner but I cannot remember what it was.  I do remember it being excellent as well.

Overall a wonderful experience and I would certainly visit again when I am in Vegas."
Always eat here when in the US. Great food. Massive portions so can never eat it all :-D. Highly recommend the veggie lettuce wraps.
"Fantastic atmosphere, gluten free food & selection & reasonable prices. Definately one to eat at again. I dont normally eat much but pf changs offer a ""take away"" service in take out boxes which worked well. Lovely selection & tasty drinks along with a fantastic gluten free selection of meals including desserts"
"We took a bunch of entrees that we decided to share. The food is delicious. Big plates and the staff is amazing. Explaining everything. When I told them I didn't like spicy, they didn't mix the sauces together. I thought it was a delicate attention from them."
The food was great as always and the service was good as well. It's a good place to eat outside (IN THE SHADE) and people watch because the glass partition is tinted so people can't see you laughing at them. lol
"Checked this restaurant out on our last night, but wish we'd tried it sooner! We had a 20 minute wait for a table, which wasn't bad considering how busy it seemed. They gave us a pager and we slipped into the casino while we waited. The menu had a great selection on it. We opted for their special offer of $45 per couple, which included two soups, a starter to share, two mains (inc. rice) and a dessert to share. Portions were huge! The wine was very reasonably priced and staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the food."
"Heard it can be busy but our waiting time didnt take long....15 mins is quite reasonable .

Had a drink at the bar while waiting for table.

Steamed dumplings were really good appetizers.

I had a chicken pad Thai and it was very good....it's the Chinese version so don't be surprised that it doesn't have the distinctive Thai taste.

My friend had the chicken Szechuan and it was very good too.  

There was a mixup with his order as they have him a shrimp Szechuan , brought to the waiters attention and he was apologetic and even offered it to go for a box but my friend politely turned it down and said waiter can have it as to go for himself instead......

Wine selection is very good but I am partial to KIm Crawford and Joel Gott.  

Very nice ambience too."
You can't go wrong here if you love Chinese food. A lot of great choices to choose from. The fried rice is always good. They have a great variety to choose from.
"This restaurant was certainly busy when we arrived and the floor space is deceptively large. The restaurant does not prepare authentic chinese cuisine, rather a modern twist on the old classics. We found this out as we have an allergy to dairy in our family and choose chinese for this reason as chinese food is rarely cooked with dairy products. We were informed that ALL of the beef dishes contain milk in the sauces. There was also no juice available for the chikdren, only soda.

I ended up having gastroenteritis the next evening after eating their pad thai...this was a horrible experience and I would never return to this restaurant."
Words cannot describe how amazing the food is at P.F Changs. If you go to Las Vegas then it's a must you go and visit this restaurant. I recently went there with 4 other friends. We all had starters where I had the calamari which was amazing followed by the new striped beef for my main which got my taste buds working overtime. The choice of food was great as was the atmosphere and the decor. The waitress was amusing and professional to say the least. So all in all it was a fab night out. Including drinks and a tip it was only $40-$50 each which was worth every penny. So go check it out for yourself and see.
"PF Chang food is just disgusting. 

Wonton soup was tasteless

Sweet and sour chicken was tasteless and had almost no bell peppers in it.

Beef with orange peel was dry and overcooked.

The only thing that we enjoyed was spring rolls.

While in Vegas go to Lotus of Siam instead much much better!!"
"PF Chang's may be a chain, but the service is fabulous and the food never disappoints.  Location is a plus---right in the center of everything."
We have had the opportunity to enjoy PF Changs on many occasions and at various locations across the USA - it has yet to disappoint. We sat at the bar for our meal this time...the bar staff was amazing! They were seamless in how they worked together - very impressive! Food and drink service was timely and fantastic.
"Recently stayed in Vegas for three nights & enjoyed our evening at this place most. Reasonable value (for Vegas) with helpful staff advising on the choices, otherwise I would never have tried the truly excellent Mongolian Beef! Other more well-known Chinese dishes available. Decent portions and excellent service. A good ambiance (even though you are effectively eating in a casino), with less than the usual, constant background noise of fruit machines etc. It gets busy, so maybe advisable to book, although we were quite happy to sit and drink at the comfortable bar for half an hour or so whilst waiting for a table."
"Great tasting dishes, great service, good value and large portions.  We always dine here when visiting Las Vegas."
"First day we picked a few entrees for lunch with nice glass of wine!  Enjoyed it so much we went back the next evening and had dinner here.  So clean,  really lovely helpful waiters and the food is gorgeous!  Best food on the strip!"
"We recently had the pleasure to dine at P F Changs.  The entire night was amazing.  We chose to sit on the outside patio and people watch.  Kirby promptly appeared at our table and got the drinks rolling.  We had no idea what to order so Kirby suggested her ""Limousine Service""  which meant she would order our entire meal.  She got it bang on. 2 appies and 4 entrees were perfect for the four of us.  Everything on the menu is fresh and perfectly cooked.  Can't say enough about the food or Kirby.  Best meal of our trip."
Food is amazing! Been to this restaurant loads of time in a few different states in America & the food is always to die for! Have tried several different things off the menu & all were great! I tell all my family & friends to go here when they are in America. Place is always busy & at night you will most likely have to wait for a table - but it is worth the wait & good value for money! From the UK.
be chinese food ive ever had. service was great i loved it!! very people orrientated and amazing servers.
"This had an excellent rating on tripadvisor so decided a visit was required.

Glad we booked as the place was EXTREMELY busy and we had to wait a few minutes for a table, which was upstairs next to the main route to the kitchen so had high traffic, but still buzzy.

Then I am not sure if it was the waiter or that he was so busy, but again, slow service to bring items

Everything was OK, food was OK ...(not a patch on Jasmine at Bellagio's ... but different price bracket) ...

Our waiter forgot an item from our order which is generally unknown as service is something I always thinks is top notch in the US and I was not expecting that from PF Changs.

Sunday night ... perhaps its marketing is exceeding its capabilities ..."
Soooo much better than chinese in the UK. The lettuce wraps were absolutey beautiful soooooooo good!!
"PF Changs is consistently good anywhere you go, and this was no exception. Servers were friendly and fast, not pushy. They offer gluten free options including condiments. I had a great iced tea and a noodle dish off the specials menu and my husband had his usual fried rice."
Soooo much better than chinese in the UK. The lettuce wraps were absolutey beautiful soooooooo good!!
"We were immediately seated at around 6PM.  Our server took our drink orders and these were served quickly with glasses of water and a bread basket.  Wine prices were $8-10 per glass.  We ordered the lettuce wraps for starters, which were excellent.  Entrees included sesame chicken and spicy chicken w/vegetables with a choice of white or brown rice.  Both entrees were delicious.  Our server prepared a dipping sauce for us and was excellent...friendly, professional and checked with us several times to ensure we had what we needed.  A request for extra lettuce for the wraps was brought quickly and with a smile.  The bill was presented promptly and was accurate.  We recommend this restaurant."
"We ate there for dinner on a Friday night. The place was packed and we waited for 30 mins for a table. The food was delicious and the service was fantastic! We ordered the Crispy Green Beans (delicious!), Ahi Crisps and Dumplings to start. They we shared the Shrimp with Lobster sauce (my favourite!), Mogolian Beef and Singapore Street Noodles. All the food was delicious. Service was great and very accommodating."
"This ever popular restaurant needs no endorsement. We had a pleasant experience too. The food was good and the service was really quick. We had a show to catch and informed the server. She ensured a very speedy service and we finished our appetizers, main course and bill in 20 minutes flat. 
It also helped that we went at a lean hour,for otherwise there would have been a long waiting time."
"PF Changs is in the Miracle Mile shops near Planet Hollywood. We stopped in for a semi-quick lunch and sat outside.  It was quite hot, but the service was great, the meals came out quickly and we were not disappointed."
The food at PF Cangs is always good. This particular one was crazy busy on the Sunday night we went. 45 minute wait. We stood at the bar and just ended up ordering standing up while waiting for our food and chairs to open up. This one is right on the stip so I would guess that it is busy almost every night of the week.
Cameron the bartender was fantastic made the best Mai Tais place to be everyday 3-6. The appetizers were goodv as well. Great location front door lead to Vegas Strip other door to PH casino. Good time for a week vacation hangout.
"The hostesses told us to wait for 15 minutes but then forgot about us as we saw them seating guests that had just walked in. Anyways the night went better when were finally seated. We started with ginger mojitos, and then had had great chicken dishes. Nice ambience and resonable prices."
"I've visited P. F. Chang's in many cities - the food is rerely bad and the service is usually good.   As P. F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood, the food was good, the service so-so, my issue with this location is that they attempted to rush you to hurry up and finish so you could leave."
"Stopped here as it was one of the first days in town and had no idea where to go. Good food, not great. Kinda mild and almost bland. Reasonably priced, not cheap at all. Good service. Panda Express food at Denver airport was tastier.."
"Shared 3 appetizers for dinner (calamari, pork dumplings & chicken lettuce wrap) and loved everything!"
"Tried P.F.Changs after going to Terry Fator. I have to say I wasn't overally impressed with this restaurant. The waiter was very friends and helpful. The starter of Egg Roll was ok but I've had much better. The main course of noodles was odd.. wasn't like what I'm used to. Bland flavour, not cooked enough, wrong type of noodle, not in a soy sauce as I was told and added celery flavour for some reason. I did enjoy there version of sweet and sour chicken but their take on egg fried rice was again not to my liking. While we were there a person walked though the front windows and the glass smashed around them. When I asked the waiter what happened he said that and that they were silly for doing so. I said well I was just wondering if they were ok.. Best thing about the meal was the fortune cookie.. we don't really get them over here."
"Went to Vegas 5 years ago and had great memories of this restaurant so on our return in April we were looking forward to going back and we weren't disappointed.
I have never tasted Chinese food anywhere near as good as this place provides.The orange chicken and Mongolian beef are superb.Portions are huge so go easy on the starters but if you're in vegas you have GOT to try this place!!!"
"We made reservations for 4 and were seated upstairs at a window seat with a view of the strip - NICE. Our waiter was Aaron, and he was funny, polite, efficient and helpful. We were 2 couples and we ordered 2 four course dinners for 2 and shared it all. Fantastic food (crab wanton was awesome). The service was fast; the food was hot; the drinks were great and Aaron was great!"
Try the beef and noodle salad..AMAZING..The service was perfect and the food so good we cant wait to go again!!
"My wife and I were in Las Vegas on a Sunday afternoon and evening. We decided to go to P.F. Chang's for dinner. I have been to P.F. Chang's before twice in my life.  My wife loves Chinese food and I like anything with an Asian Flare. 
I have always thought that maybe P.F. Chang's was like the Olive Garden of Asian food, but I was wrong.  I apologize for thinking that.
We were seated outside on there patio..Which is truly on the Strip, so if you want something a little more private and less street noise, sit inside.
Our server...Darlene.. was amazing!!

Not one time did we have to ask for more water, or anything. They asked us!  My wife and I split dinner and we are glad we did. The Food, The Service..Top Notch!!

My suggestion to anyone who reads this in upper management for P.F. Chang's - If Darlene is interested in moving up, you better grab her now.  
Thanks for the servife and great dinner. We will be going back!"
The food was the same as most PF Changs (good) and the prices for Vegas were better than most other places... would highly recommend. Make sure you reserve a table or get there early.
"We had dinner here with my folks last night. It was all in all a good meal. The food was good, the portions large, and the service was excellent. The meal was a nice change from others we have had in Vegas: the prices were fair ($150 for four of us including a fair amount of wine!) and it was nice to have something other than the usual French-Italian-American bistro fare we have eaten pretty much everywhere else. Quite noisy but it's a casino restaurant so not a surprise.

We had the calamari and lettuce/chicken wraps to start - excellent - and for the mains three chicken dishes (which all seemed quite similar but with different sauces) and some spicy prawns. The starters were the stand-out. We could probably have done with three mains between four rather than four."
"We ate at this restaurant a number of times on our recent visit to Vegas. The food was outstanding, the service was excellent every time and extremely reasonable and excellent value for money in comparison to other casino restaurants. We can't wait to go back to sample further delights of P.F. Chang's. 
Thank you to all the staff at P.F. Chang's for making our visit most enjoyable!"
"We went here for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it, the food was fresh and well presented, we ordered 3 dishes each came with its own rice but we asked them to leave those out and instead ordered a fried rice to accompany the other dishes.  Average price for a dish was $10.to $12 for seafood.  Table service was good and meal service was quick alowing for cooking time.  You need to book a table if you want to go here as at peak times it is very busy, so book in advance. I would most deffinately use again in vegas.  Located at the very from outside entrance to planet hollywood."
"We eat here about every 6 weeks. Live close. Enjoy moderate and fine dining. The food at the PH location is good. Service above average, Cooks consistent with menu selections, which is a good thing, especially for a chain.. We dine at the bar when its crowded. Easy for us to get to since we can walk within minutes. parking a PH is tiring to say the least. Hard to make a wrong selection but you might check with your server if experimenting"
"This was my second trip to a PF Chang's. I went to one in Garden City New York and was underwhelmed. I would never have eaten there again except I was in Las Vegas for a conference and someone had booked PF Chang's for a group dinner. Again - underwhelmed by everything but the check. When I went to Garden City I wondered how they could stay in business against the fantastic local competition we have on Long Island. In Las Vegas I found much consistency, consistent my prior experience at a PF Chang's-- mediocre at best, consistent with other comparably priced restaurants in Vegas..again like their LV Competitors-- mediocre at best. My spouses Asian Grilled Norwegion Salmon was overcooked and dry. My Chilean Sea Bass was in a horrible sauve, and also was overcooked. I should have ordered  chow main! If you like the PF Changs in other cities you will like this. Otherwise there are many alternatives in Vegas. Stay away from the mid-priced chains- they are consistent--consistently mediocre. They did give special attention to our large party but were slow on presenting the bills, and we had a show to  catch. You can do much better than PF Chang's really!"
"The service and dinner were fabulous! We had a waiter who never stopped!  He was there for us any timke we needed something.  He thanked us for dining at PF's.  The deserts he suggested were all mouth watering, but we simply were too full to add any more to our palates."
"We went here one evening for a special meal and to be honest the food was excellent however considering we ordered 4 different main meals from the menu and they all came out looking like the exact same dish it wasnt very exciting.

Quite a que to get a seat so i would adivse a reservation for a group."
"Excellent service, seated immediately, food sitting on the table in less then 15 minutes. As far as Chinese food goes I would give it a 7/10. This place is very affordable, the atmosphere is nice, and service is friendly. Best of all you are in the best hotel for gaming Planet Hollywood, take your wife for dinner and with the money you save hit the tables! It's a win, win!"
My college buddies and I stopped for a variety of appetizers and drinks.  The server was helpful with recommendations and knew his stuff.  The food was very good and the beer was cold.
"I would not call this the best food. If you are from a major city, you have had better Chinese food. I would say that PF Changs is average what you expect Chinese food, nothing more or less. I`ve eaten at PF Changs twice during our 5 day stay at Planet Hollywood. The service was slow. They are really busy most of the time. Food is not expensive; it is under $20 per person. Beer was $5."
"This is a good chain restaurant that we visited because there was an hour wait at the BurGR restaurant next door. We like the PF Changs restaurant near our house in Houston so we knew what to expect. We liked it even better than the one at home, Their lunch menu was more extensive. . The food was fresh and properly cooked. The waitress was friendly and attentive."
This is the most amazing Chinese restaurant I've ever been too!! Loads of choices and very reasonable prices.  Ended up eating in the restaurant during our trip in Vegas and the food was delicious every time. The chocolate cake is to die for!!!  I'm gutted we don't have this restaurant in the UK!
"This is a favorite of mine,  and when you are alone, you can usually squeeze up to the bar and eat.  I don't like to wait long.  Love their appetizers, crab wontons and spring rolls,they do have tables outside so you can people watch which also a great pastime in Vegas."
great food with great atmosphere and really great prices   location also very central  happy hour is good
"My wife and I stayed in Las Vegas for a few days recently at the Paris Hotel on the Strip. Next door is Planet Hollywood where this restaurant is located. We have eaten at several PF Changs in the USA, and at this one before.
The food is good, but depends on what you order. We never have Chinese starters as these tend to fill you up before you get to the main dishes. In general the food came hot on the several times we visited the restaurant, although at really busy times this doesn't happen. Every dinner time was crowded and very noisy. So don't expect a romantic quiet evening here.
The servers are generally good, but can get a bit cranky if overworked.
The only real criticism we had was that some dishes were far too salty. The spicy green beans dish on every occasion was completely doused in salt, to make it almost inedible.
Other than this we would definitely go there again on our next trip from London."
"Recently I have lost 20 pds. and i have been "" calorie counting "" so when I went to Vegas, i was looking for a place i could eat at that taste great and is low in calories. Well I found it here. I ordered the Dim Sum Lunch for $8.95. I had the mixed green salad w/ lime dressing and 2 orders of shrimp dumplings ( 3 in an order ). The mixed green salad was good but the dumplings were excellent. The total calorie count for this meal : mixed green salad w/ lime dressing and 6 shrimp dumplings w/ spicy mustard sauce was only 320. Great Food, Low in Calories, I'm Happy !!! :)"
"Good lunch at P.F. Chang's. not a bad Resturant, just nothing unique about the fare served. The chain restaurants inside the casinos charge a premium price for a meal that is priced less at their other locations."
"Great location on the Strip, excellent menu, caring service and reasonably priced. We're pleased to add this facilty to the list of PFC's we have enjoyed in Honlolulu and Pheonix.
Also celiac friendly."
The server turned me and my wife on to Blue Moon Beer with a shot of blueberry vodka it was the hit of the dinner!!
"We had a great dinner at Pf Chang´s Las Vegas.  We went with the entire family, parentes, teens and  children.  We really enjoyed excellent food with wide variety.  Fantastic meal specially lettuce wraps, Try them!!"
We had a lite dinner there while out shopping and had exceptional service as always. I had two friends with me who have never been to a PF Changs. They were elated and really wished we had one at home.
"Coming from australia which has some fantastic Asian restaurants, I didn't have high expectations for my dinner there. I had done some research into good places to eat whilst I was staying in planet hollywood, and pf changs didn't make my list. The meal was fantastic and the service great. Eating solo, I ate at the bar and felt welcomed. Busy night but service was brisk. My meal was the steamed salmon with mushrooms, shallots in a dark sauce. Great value as well. If your staying near by give this place a go. Wouldn't recommend staying in planet hollywood however."
"Ate at P.F. Chang's at the Planet Hollywood at least 3 times during my 10 day business trip in December - healthy choices, vegetarian menu, unbeatable prices for the quality of food offered. I could eat up and down their menu without ever getting bored of the food. Friendly staff, nice ambience, great service to larger groups. Great asset to the Planet Hollywood hotel, better than any other restaurants in the hotel."
"I love all PF Changs ,and this one in particular is no different, service was swift and food was awesome as always! Sat outside and people watched, enjoyed my food, under the nice sun!"
"This PF Changs is like any other PF Changs.  The food is average (not bad, just average).  The service is also chain-restaurant average.  If anything, order the spring rolls and a beer for an app, then head somewhere else for dinner.  Even the edamame was boring and soggy."
Always enjoy PF Chang's and this one in the Planet Hollywood was no different. We were a large group of 30 and so they gave us an area upstairs and we were served buffet style. My two favorites - lettuce wraps and Mongolian Beef were served. Wow!! Definitely recommend PF Chang's in Planet Hollywood
"Will keep this short...

Crab Wontons - a must try!
Tasty, satisfying dishes!  
Large portions!
Priced very reasonably!
Excellent service!"
Was shocked at how good the food and service were here. We enjoyed this place more than some of the 5 stars that we read about before going. We are going again this summer and will be eating there for sure.
"PF is one of our very favorite restaurants. 

Start with the chicken lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari.  We get it every time we go.  They are two of the best appetizers ever. 

PF never disappoints.  Not us at least.  We always have fantastic meals and quick service.  One of the best restaurants time and time again in the planet Hollywood."
"The menu here is pretty extensive and you will want to try everything. The dishes are ordered to share. Crispy Honey Chicken is good, so are the dumplings. Save room for dessert too...loosen the belt and indulge! The 7-layer chocolate cake will leave you looking for someone to roll you out onto the strip and to your hotel."
"We dined here with friends and were given a secluded area, like being in a cubby house!

Our waitress, Christina was fabulous.  She explained everything in detail and was a pleasure to deal with.

The wonton soup was consumed quickly, the seabass with spicy sauce was devine as was the pad thai and all the other dishes.

My margarita was the best I'd had in ages."
"We tried the 4 course meal for 2 and it was fantastic! Here is a tip: if there is a wait and downstairs bar is full, go check the upstairs bar. Bar seating is first come first served. The portions are big; it's almost a meal for 3."
"We visited PF Changes on 3/8 for their happy hour menu.  As always, the service was top notch and the food was wonderful.  I always visit PF Chang's when I am in Vegas because they do not dissappoint!"
"Despite being a chain restaurant, P.F. Chang's at the Planet Hollywood has become a favourite for my husband and I.  We make a point of coming every time we are in Vegas and we are never disappointed.  This time, we brought our two kids 12 & 8 yrs. old and they loved it too.  Serving sizes are reasonable, decor is very nice, food is very good and it's reasonably priced.  Service is fine and the place is quite big so you don't usually have a long wait to be seated.  Highly recommend the lettuce wraps and the spicy shrimp appetizer- Yum !"
"Very good PF Chang's. Would visit again. Good service, attentive and food was prepared very well. We were seated immediately with reservations. Our server was fairly quick to the table and offered the common drinks, appetizers, etc. Did the vegetarian lettuce wraps, a cup of soup and two entree's and drinks for about $50. Great food at a great value anywhere, but especially for Vegas."
"Good food, good service.  There is 2 locations and my preference is the location that is 'free standintg' and off the strip."
Not different than any other PF Changs but I wanted to review it since even when restaurant was jammed service was good so if you see the rest. full and waiting time is not much and would wait anyway.
wanted to sit out on the patio somewhere and PF Chang's fit the bill.  It is next to Planet Hollywood so attracts a lot of young folks for good people watching.  The food and service are what you would expect at PF Changs.  It provides a good value along with excellent food right on the strip.
"Food was really good. Prices were good, in fact we ate here twice!
Service was faultless.
Menu had a nice variety."
"Front desk girls seemed very rude, answering phonesin the middle of talking to you. Very busy, would recommend reservations, cost me more gambling during the wait than the meal. Wait staff was very good and proffesional, but seemed very busy. We had the dinner for two on the menu and loved it. Great value for the money. Left ful and brought some home for breakfast. Recommended."
"Oh soooooo good.  I missed it as hadn't been in 2 years.  PF Changs opened a restaurant in Toronto and I thought it didn't taste as good, especially the seabass, lettuce wraps and wonton soup.  But wasn't sure whether it was so different than the one in Vegas.  But this meal...the seabass was amazing!  The wonton soup was way better than the Toronto one.  And the lettuce wraps were so good.  I'm gonna to visit the Toronto one one more time soon and compare again.  If big difference I'm going to write a scathing review to that one - I love PF Changs and it is a tragedy to open one up in Toronto in name only...."
I was very pleased with the vegetarian and gluten-free options. The lettuce wraps were particularly tasty!
The food was excellent and delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  The service was excellent and atmosphere was pleasant.
"We stayed at Paris -Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood is located right next door.  There is a PF Chang's in that casino and one evening we called in an order for pick up. 

We order what we would back home, and everything was as good as it was there. (It's a chain I expected it to be uniform)

But what made this PF Chang's special was the superb waitstaff and attention to the customer. I felt valued and as I looked around I could see this was a key element to their customers in the bar and dining room as well.

If you're going for a sit down meal - make reservations,
If you have a Total Rewards card - present it for a discount.

Enjoy!!!!"
"Everyone I know has eaten here you must too!
The prices are very reasonable and the portions were large. 
We randomly selected form the menu and were served the most appetizing dishes. The service was great and most importantly the food was fresh and hot. Cant wait to eat here next time I'm in Vegas."
"When we go to Las Vegas, we always make sure we eat here at least 3 times. The meals are prepared in an outstanding manner and the quality and quantity are also outstanding. There is plenty of room even when are busy as there is also an upstairs. The drinks are also great. The people who work there go out of there way to ensure you are always taken care of. If you go several times they also remember you and even remember what you usually drank or ate. It is quite clean and no smoking and the atmosphere is enjoyable."
Food is quality and the staff is friendly. Just what you expect from any PF Changs.  Did not disappoint.
"My wife and I ate at this location and had a very nice dinner.  We had eaten at another PF Changs a few week earlier and they had a promotion.  You received an envelope that you opened at the next PF Chang's visit.  When we opened ours in front of the waiter we discovered we were to get 10% off our meal.  We ordered and the meal was very good and we enjoyed it.  The problem we had was that we ordered a combination meal and when the waiter presented the ticket he said that the discount didn't apply.  We understood the reason, but wondered why that wasn't told when we placed the order.  I am not sure we would have changed, but it might have made a difference.  If they offer the promotional items they need to make sure the customer is aware of any exceptions."
"Great place to have a nice meal on the strip, our waiter was great. It's a two story restaurant, a little overpriced but that is normal for the strip. It was great food overall."
"Four of us ate at PF Changs tonight and thoroughly enjoyed the food.  The service was excellent.  Although extremely busy, we were seated in a nice booth within 15 minutes of arrival and our waiter was really friendly.  Both couples chose the set meal for 2 and the food was served promptly.  The rest of the menu had excellent choice and the prices are very good especially when considering the location of this place.  Value for money! Just one thing I would like to point out for my fellow UK visitors - they don't serve 'prawn crackers'.  The waiter made a point of bringing us 3 dips & even put a spoonful of two of them into the other one & said how good this should taste, however, when we asked if we would get prawn crackers he said no.  He then came back and asked what they were as someone else had just asked for them too!  Wow, can't believe he didn't know - he has a good idea now though :-) So my question to the restaurant would be - what were the dips for ?? We had no use for them! I would definitely recommend the restaurant ... Hopefully next time they will have PC's on the menu."
Went here on a recent trip.Had a wonderful gluten free meal here .So nice to have some gluten free choices.Just loved the Mongolian beef
"Consistant food and service in a very large and busy 2 story restaurant.  Enjoyed a variety of dishes, all good.  For the soup, get the bowl, only $2 more than the cup and 4 times as much.  Northern rib (dry rubbed) are so good."
Never ate at a PF Changs before but this place was very good. Nice selection an the prices were in line for the strip. Service was good an the food was very good. Good place to eat at when in Vegas
We really enjoyed the spring rolls. Husband and I had a salad. I enjoyed my lemon chicken.  The lo mein noodles were my favorite.
"Usually don't like to eat a chain restaurants when traveling, but it was for a special event, and we wanted to ensure the dinner was good...and it was.  Always."
"Worst pf changs we have ever been to.  Service was slow, waiter was ready to go home and food was bland. Not impressed!"
"PF Changs came highly recommended by a friend & it certainly didn't disappoint. Everything was wonderful. Including the cocktails. 
Entree- crab wontons, spring rolls & calamari was awesome. 
Main- chicken fried rice, chicken & cashew, sweet & sour pork, with a side plate of garlic snap peas. 
Everything was delicious. And our waiter was wonderful. It's great going with friends so you can order different dishes to share & try more menu items. 
Great night topped off with a fortune cookie!"
This is average P F Changs but is located right of the strip and a nice alternative for solo who does not want to dine at a buffet or high end alone while in Vegas.
"definetly make a reservation....the place is always busy.
Good food and good portion sizes.   I highly recommend ordering the ""meal for two"".
They have a great variey to choose from."
"If you are solo or with one other and the bar downstairs is full.. sneak upstairs in the back there is another bar that seats 8, with a large screen TV. Usually open spots there!"
"Be sure to make a reservation.  Ask for seating up stairs, as it is much quieter than downstairs.  Ask for window and you can view the Bellagio fountains.   Great beer selection.  Can't beat the Lettuce wraps.   Loved the Mo Shoo Pork and Beef Stir Fry.     Great place where small or large group."
My wife and I enjoyed a great meal with great service here.  Our waitress was great and the food was delicious. Will definitely want to return sometime in the future.
"Couldn't fault the food. So good, we ate there twice in our 5 night stay. The Dynamite Shrimps were heaven."
"I could eat Chinese food for breakfast lunch and dinner and probably have done many a time. I ate here 4 times in the week I was staying in Feb 2013.
I had the signature dish of Chicken lettuce wraps..yes they were tasty and if you haven't had this before then you should try. It is sometimes known as ""San Choy Bow"" in other restaurants where they may use pork instead of chicken but same overall flavours and basic idea of wrapping it up in a lettuce leaf.
Dumplings were also good and on par with any other decent Chinese restaurants.
I ordered the ""Bowl"" of soup, being told on the 4 occasions that I did order it, that it was huge!! and it was.... enough for 3 maybe 4 people but I managed it because I was damn hungry! Egg drop and Wonton soup very good.
The Chengdu Lamb was very interesting utilising cumin and mint which is normally only used in Middle Eastern or Indian cooking but the combination worked well and was quite tasty.
The caramel chicken on the other hand a slight let down with no real stand out ""wow"" flavour. The Mango in the dish was flavourless and I would rate this on par with your average Chinese take away chicken dish on a Friday night. 
The side of spinach with garlic was also a let down, the spinach was overcooked and the garlic was burnt which gave a dry and unpleasant bitterness to the dish.
So 3.5 out of 4 meals isn't too bad and would happily eat here again as there were so many other things I didn't try which I'm sure would be great!!
I'll give it a 4/5 rating because the service definitely made up for the one not so good dish I had."
"PF Changs has been one of my wife's favorites for a while now, as she's been to it several times while travelling for business.  Until this weekend, however, I had never been to one - despite her good reviews.

So when looking for a place for dinner while in Vegas I decided to give it a shot, despite my natural aversion to chain restaurants when on vacation.  I have to say I was very happy I did!

We had the chicken lettuce wraps as a starter, and they were delicious.  We shared the mongolian beef and the sesame chicken for entrees, with the chicken being good and the beef being a standout!  Loved it!  Portions were good, service was friendly, atmosphere was nice, drinks were terrific.  And all of this for around $60?!?

An all around winner!"
This used to be a well kept Vegas locals hot spot.  Now it has been a visitors hot spot. The menu is amazing and all fresh. The most important thing is It has a Gluten Free menu !!
"The food and service was great,  probably the best meal we had in Vegas. The nicest surprise was when the bill came and it did not have the Vegas up charge."
"Love this restaurant.  It has a very comfortable ambiance.  The food and service are excellent.  The wait staff will make you feel very welcome.  Can't beat Happy Hour.  The wine is terrific and the price is right.  There is a Happy Hour menu with lots of goodies.  I ate 6 different things and all were perfection, but one of my favorites was the tuna sushi.  Their ribs are very tasty.  I will be sure to return."
"We've been to PF Chang several times in Fort Lauderdale and really enjoyed it. So during our trip in Las Vegas with our 3 kids (14, 18, 21 years old) they wanted to go. The place was full. The noise level was loud but the food was just great. We ordered one won ton soup for the 5 of us. It's enough! The soup is huge! Just say you want to share and they will bring bowls and spoons for everybody. Then we ordered 3 main dishes (orange beef, beef and broccolis, chicken n' vegetables...),  steamed rice for everybody. The saké was nice and warm. The staff was kind. We had a nice large round table with a perfect view on the strip. The price is not cheap but very reasonable. I recommand the place!"
"We eat a PF Chang's every time we come to Las Vegas (4-5 times a year). They just do Oriental food a cut above every one else. Always get thier famous lettuce wraps for an appetizer.

Just found out about the Warriors club. It gives freebies based on you patronage."
PF Changs is always good.  This trip was just like all the others.  You can never go wrong when you you stop at a PF Changs.
"Excellent food, considering it's not an authentic Chinese restaurant. Service was good but the queue too long at dinner time. Price on the high side but worth it considering the taste of real good Chinese food in Vegas. The restaurant is packed and the noise level was terribly loud though. So it's not place to relax after a long walk back from the strip."
"We always try to catch a PF Changs when we travel.  This one was great- good service, friendly waiting staff, food was yummy.  They were even kind enough to box our food so we could take it back for snack later and gave us plastic utensils.  They have an outside area you can dine at, which you can see the fountains at across the street.  You can also sit inside near the windows and people watch- if thats your gig.  We enjoyed so much we came back again before departing our brief trip. Oh- and come hungry or share the servings are HUGE."
"Very typical of their standards and food quality I always expect.  Great job to your staff, the food and service were great."
Food and service was great. My brother and his wife love it and wanted to go and I agree with them!!
We usually have a couple of safe bet places to save a little money or get away from the expensive steakhouse or cheap buffets..so PF Changs is our safe bet and savings for Chinese and Maggianos for Italian.
Went at 7:30 on Valentine's night. Did not have reservations and the wait was only about 30 minutes. Our booth was upstairs which was not as easy to have access to restrooms and leaving. Inside Planet Hollywood so you can use the slot machines outside the restaurant as entertainment while you wait for your table. This is one of our favorite restaurants and the food was great.
"We love PF Chang's and since we don't have one near home, we love that there is one in PH.  The service is always great and the food wonderful!"
"US. $44 dollars for 2 people and great food
Right in the middle of the strip. Great place for a lunch break"
"Great resturant, found and ate here twice as they catered well for a gluten free diet. great value too."
A group of 5 of use went in during lunch for a course we where taking.  The staff was courteoous nd fast.  Food quality excellent.
"Great food, friendly staff! The very first place I ate during my very first visit to Las Vegas, and I go back every time!"
"During our last trip to Las Vegas my wife and me had the chance to finally try PF Changs and it was delightful, dishes were served quite fast, taste was wonderful and price was low considering  other dinning options just beside. People working there are nice.
Te only thinng we did not like was having to wait for a table in the entrance while almost all of the second floor tables were empty. Hope they improve it."
"Every time I go to Vegas and Planet Hollywood, someone insists on going to P.F. Chang's. The food is terrible. It's overly salty, overcooked and dry, and shows none of the variety of flavorings that make good Chinese food appealing. I have to confess that the service has always been quite good, but it doesn't make up for the poor food quality."
"This was my first visit to a P.F. Chang's and it was a shame that it was my first time as I have missed out on such a good restaurant in the past.

From the moment we stepped in we felt very welcome, WE asked if we could could book a table for 6pm  which was in 30min, I could see the restaurant filling up quickly and they said that we had done the right thing by asking as they would be a large queue soon which did happen.

We had a quick drink then came straight back to find a large queue but the waiter who had taken my booking saw me walking in and came up to me to show us to our table. Two of our party had been in the past  and recommended that we have a mixture of starter which we did. We had some very very nice spare ribs and two types spring rolls and some duck Which we all enjoyed. When we made our choice for main meals the waiter told us not to get a portion of rice for all off us as they would be plenty in two for the total party(5). I went for Mongolian beef which I had never had before and I am so glad that I did as it was so nice. Other dishes in party inc. Salmon, beef with broccoli, Mu Shu chicken and crispy honey chicken which everyone enjoyed.

The whole party said that they enjoyed the food very much and for what we paid we all agreed that it was good value for money."
"Our server was great .. we had to get in and out, to make it to a evening show, and our waiter did everything possible to get us in and out with in an hour. The food was absolutely delicious and very reasonablly priced.   ***** star"
"We ALWAYS eat at Chang's when in Las Vegas.  Great food choices, great service, great location.   Go early to beat the crowds."
"Whenever we are in Las Vegas, this is usually our place to go the day after we arrive. Staff are always helpful and friendly, food is amazing, what more do you need??? We always start off with the crab wontons and the lettuce wraps (usually chicken or beef). Then pick a few mains and share it amongst each other. Always a good time, will be back!!!"
"I hate to eat at places in Vegas that we have at home.. really, though, if you have a Total Rewards card from Harrah's properties, and are thinking about using the points at Spice Market buffet, just say ""No"", and eat here instead.. your tummy will thank you later"
I was pleasantly surprised to find the quality and affordability of this restaurant on the strip. The food was great and so was the service. I'd definitely come back.
In 2 trips to Vegas we ate here 3 times- and I can say it is the best Asian fusion food I have ever eaten! The lettuce wraps are divine and so it everything else! Plus they not only didn't kick us out when we were drunk and loud but they were super nice lol.....Love this place!
"I've been to a couple now, the one on Paradise, and the one at Green Valley. Both are terrific for a super tasty meal, if you are not counting calories.
All the menu items are reasonably priced, and all the sauces/preparations are about as flavorful as they could possibly be. you'll likely have a 1500 calorie meal, but you'll enjoy it."
"Hello folks, was in vegas for a short vacation with girl friend and decided to go out for diner. We had so many choices... But wanted some thai or asian food. So we decided on this place... Good choice...
It was a friday night. The place was packed. We were looked after from the moment we set the foot inside until we paid our bill. Service was gat considering that this place is huge.. Maybe 400 places at least. Waiters and waitresses everywhere... I don't know how many kitchens but awesome. So we were sat in a corner where we could spend a good time. We were catered like no tomorrow. The server was professional and know what he was selling. We had gat drinks, great food and service was awesome. The price was good, 100$ for. 3 course meal with drinks. Remember you are in vegas... 
So, please make ureself a favor and try this great place.
G"
"Just finished having dinner, food was great and atmosphere very pleasant.  Ordered dinner for two and had good choices with dessert. Wine was reasonable also.  We made a dinner reservation and got seated upstairs, which was a little quieter, with a nice view.  Would definately
eat here again."
"We've visited PF Chang's in Utah, Hawaii and Las Vegas and this Las Vegas location is absolutely the best in both food and service. The wait time is usually a little less than they have told us when we have walked in.  We have also used their reservation service when we knew it was going to be busy and that was great.  Unfortunately our local PF Chang's rate's very poorly on service and on food quality, so we always make a point to visit this location when we come to Las Vegas."
CAme here for the first time when we were here for New Years.  The place was packed but they give you a pager so you can wander the casino floor while you wait. Took about 45 min to get seated but that's how long they said it would be.  The service was very good and the food was great.  Thought it was reasonably priced for the quality and location right on the strip.  Would definitely recommend eating here anytime!
"Great place for lunch , I'm turning into a regular , great food and it taste the same every time you eat there very consistent , well worth a trip at lunch time , try the chicken wraps fantastic ."
"While PF Changs is not a unique place to eat in Vegas, but it's still a pleasant experience. Every time we decide to grab a late night meal here, we always have a great experience. The service is always amazing, as is the food. The price is about the same as PF Changs that are not on the strip. The cashew and almond chicken is my favorite with spring roll appetizers. It's enough to feed two for under $25."
Yummy food just in the hotel. It was really cold out so going elsewhere didnt seem like a good option. My food was amazing!
"I love Chang's and was pleased to find it at Planet Hollywood.  My daughter, her boyfriend and I stopped in for a variety of appetizers and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Try the ginger beer!"
"They sat us at a table right in front of the door and it was so cold.
The food was too pricey for what you get."
"Once again the experience at this restaurant was top notch.  The food was excellent, the service was fantastic and the atmosphere was relaxed and fun.  The value for your money was great as well.  Simply put we make it a must visit part of our trip every time we are there."
"We had an incredible meal here! Food was gorgeous, atmosphere was great, as we had a table on the patio! It was fab eating great food, drinking champagne and watching everything happening on the strip xxx would definitely recommend this to anyone seeking an oriental dining experience xxx"
Love going to PF Changs when I'm in the USA. The food is always top notch and tasty. Price-wise I think it was quite reasonable too.
"My daughter and I took a lunch break here after shopping! We don't normally go to this type of place as I rarely pay retail or full price for anything. Occassionally I get a coupon for free lettuce wraps here but since they put mushrooms in them and I am allergic...I have yet to take them up on the offer. SO, as I was saying, this was a rare treat. 
The atmosphere was lively, the place is a little too loud with the background noise, since its such an open space, but maybe that's just me. I'm not a fan of all that noise. 
We were still able to carry on a decent conversation, but I felt at times like I had to speak up. Again, maybe its just me. 
The server was excellent, my daughter commented how he seemed to really be happy to work there! We liked that!
The lunch menu was reasonably priced and the portions were perfect. We thought they looked small when served, but its an optical illusion in those white bowls. We started with egg drop soup, which was perfect! Followed by a main course of sweet and sour chicken. We were both stuffed, even after eating with chopsticks! LOL! OK, I ate with them but my daughter only ""tried"" them to satisfy my demands. She used a fork, as all true white girls do.
This Rampart/Charleston location is easy in, easy out and plenty of parking. Great off strip location for those who know how to get around town or locals!
Highly recommend this place."
"Not hard to tell that this place is popular! The spring rolls were great, the Mongolian Beef and Spicy Shrimp were divine. The portion sizes aren't huge but adequate. We shared 3 dishes between 4 of us and was just right. Great service even though the place was packed! We'll be back next time we hit the Strip!"
"First time I ate here was in 2008, the food is still as good today as the first time. Restaurant was clean and the service was great. A favorite in vegas for me."
Good range of dishes to choose from. Great service and reasonably priced. We found the meal sizes to be quite large so be careful how much you order.
"I've been to other P.F.s, but this one seems to have a little better service and of course, the food is great. Their lettuce wraps are a must, but they can fill you up so you can't enjoy the many other great dishes!"
"Really good tastey food and great friendly service. Our meal arrived really quickly, piping hot and fresh. Fantastic value for money"
Chang's usual great food and good service.  The prices are fair especially for the wine.  Expect a bit of a wait but it is a great alternative to event dining on the strip.
Staff were fantastic and what a treat for my husband and daughter to be able to get a 3 course gluten free Chinese meal.  All the food was fantastic.
Food is quite good and it comes in a large quantity. Very reasonable prices and good service. You can share one dish among two people.
"Went here for our wedding dinner, absolutely make a reservation. Paul was our waiter and he was awesome, so much fun. W ordered from their packages, pay $29 a person and get to choose from a variety of different things. With a big group they will give you a deal on the price. Food was FABULOUS, it is very noisy, so if you are looking for quiet and intimate this is NOT the place. Will definitely be returning each tie we visit Vegas."
"We ate here with U.S. relatives who regularly visit Las Vegas and always find time to visit Chang's. It is part of a chain of restaurants but don't let that put you off - tasty,well-cooked food at reasonable prices and attentive service. you can't go wrong."
These restaurants are all so beautifully and elegantly decorated that I always expect the prices to be much higher than they are.  And the food is consistently delicious.  We have tried most things on the menu and have never been disappointed with either the flavor or portion size.  Their food has so much more flavor than traditional Chinese food. Always a treat.
"PF Chang's in PH is just as good as PF Chang's everywhere!  Great food, great service!  Also, have great drinks and right off the casino in Planet Hollywood or off the sidewalk of the strip so easy to get to!  If you're hungry for lettuce wraps, don't just pass by!"
I stayed at the Planet Hollywood and ate lunch here one day. I was surprised on how fresh some on the ingredients seemed to be. If you stay in PH don;t miss this restaurant for a casual lunch or diner.
"Having wanted to go to Vegas for a very long time, and hearing nothing but raves about the food, choosing places to eat was not taken lightly by my lady and I. 
Having had the standard take-out near my apartment in Queens, and then going to Chinatown in NYC for authentic, I've pretty much run the spectrum from awful to downright breathtakingly fantastic food.
PF Changs is closer to awful.
We could honestly not see any difference in taste and quality between this restaurant my local joint. Except of course...in price.
The service was fine, the place was a little threadbare (being right on the strip), but the food was the same quality as hundreds of small places I have had the disappointment in having to eat in when nothing else was open.
Doughy dumplings, overcooked, almost meatless ribs, soups that should just have been listed as ""salt soup"" to prepare the assault on your taste buds.
You could (and should) do much better for a dinning choice."
Consistent quality and excellent flavor and selection. Note this is not the one on the strip. We had been to this one more than once.
"The best fried rice I have ever tasted. I was so worried about getting sick before our wedding day that once I discovered the rice and won ton soup from PF Changs practically lived off of it for 3 days straight.  

If you are staying at Planet Hollywood don't bother with room service, it can take awhile.  Just order pick up and bring back to your room.  Very little wait time and super delish."
"Great price for lovely good, full of flavour. The restaurant was very busy but managed to get seated within 20 mins and didn't wait ages for food."
"Because I am Asian, I look for restaurants that serves Asian or Chinese food and I found P.F. Chang right along the strip.  Nice ambiance.  Ordered their pot stickers, the chicken wrap with lettuce is the best, it really has the taste of Chinese ingredients.  Hot and sour soup is also okay.  We had prawns in lobster sauce, chicken in 5 spice and chow mien.. They were all good.. Satisfied my craving for rice and viands.."
"After not being able to get a table for 45 minutes the first night we went in here, we decided to book for a night later in our stay - this place always seems busy so maybe not somewhere you can just pop in and get a table when you're hungry. 

We shared the lettuce wraps for starter which were good. We were offered more lettuce as we finished what we had been given but by that point we'd already started to eat the filling without the lettuce so we just continued!

For main we shared sweet and sour chicken and beef with broccoli. Both were lovely and had a lot less sauce than we're used to getting with these sort of dishes at home but it was just right. 

There was a bit of a wait between the starter and main course, but the place was super busy and our server was great once he realised we were waiting, so we didn't mind too much. 

Overall, a good, filling meal."
We had wonderful food and service at PF Changs!  The waiter was knowledgeable and even noticed when my husband's food was not quite what he ordered......he immediately gave him both entrees....one for free!  Very nice!
"Probably the best value for a sit down meal on the strip.  Never a long wait, and you know the food you get is very good."
"I hosted a girls weekend getaway from 12/16-12/19/12 and we had lunch @ P.F. Chang's China Bistro which was a random decision one of the days during our stay. Apparently we had arrived a bit too early for the start of happy hour as informed by our very nice server. So, we ordered food then calculated by the time we had received our orders it would be happy hour which is was!

The food was awesome! I had the salt & peper calamari. That is a must have! Fried to perfection. Not too greasy and very light. For happy hour I had 2 lemon drops and something else that was also great!  I do recall the drinks we had were 1/2 price and that happy hour started @ 3pm. The pricing was pretty average about $$-$$$. Looking at the place you get the impression that you must be decked out in order to eat there but that wasn't the case at all and they made you feel very welcomed. The ambiance was that of relaxation and casual dining. It is a must try!"
"pf changs in Planet Hollywood is a great place to eat. With appetizers, 2 entres and a couple of drinks -under $50!! Meals are super tasty and you get lots of it, rarely finish the main. make a reservation, or you may wait up to 45 min, but they give you a buzzer that is good for 50 ft into the casino, or have a drink at the bar and enjoy the people watching.  Great value, great server ,Steve!"
We had the lettuce wraps as an appetizer and they were excellent as always. The waitress told us that this was the highest grossing PF Chang's restaurant the company has. They had a good selection of wine and beers. We shared two entrees and both were excellent.  Our waitress was friendly although they obviously have a lot of tables to cover. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food on a budget.
Very nice restaurant located off the casino in Planet Hollywood. Food was very tasty. Good service. I will probably go there again when staying at Planet Hollywood.
"As a Canadian, we do not have P.F. Chang's, so this was my first time. Price was astronomical and I am not sure that was normal for them or if it was because we were in Las Vegas. Food was fine. We ate at Panda Express also and enjoyed it more."
"This trip we had great seating, a friendly and courteous waiter, and very good food.  The time before it was the opposite.

Good luck."
"We just got done watching Jeff Dunham at Caesars, it was 11, trying to figure out where to go because all 4 of us were hungry, I suggested PF Changs because I never have had a bad meal there and they did not disappoint!!! We called to make sure they were open, they said they closed at midnight, we were there by 1130, they were as busy then as during ""normal"" dinner hours. Service was wonderful, food was top notch, perfect ending to a long, eventful day"
"We have eaten at PF Changs in Arizona and California.  This was our first time at Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas.  We enjoyed the food and atmosphere so much we went back a second time.  The selection of food was great (as for all PF Changs)- and the quality and quantity of food was also very good.  We were allowed to select a table with a window view - could watch the walkers on the Strip.  Servcie was great as usual.  We went back a second time, and would go back again when we are in the area."
"We had a group of 8 and none of us had ever eatten at a PF Changs before and by recommendation of another friend we tried it...VERY good recommendtation on his part, the food was AWESOME! Some of the best chinese I've had! I would also recommend a PFX drink...they're tasty as well! We had as a group the chicken lettuce wraps (SUPER YUM!) and crab wontons for apps...very good choices.

My meal (beef and broccoli) was great, not a one of us compained about our meal! (That says a lot coming from cowboys/ranchers that sometimes stick their nose in the air at the sound of anything other than a steak)...the price was reasonable also (we had drinks (2-3 per person) and ordered off of the lunch menu so it was about $60-75/couple)

I also really appreciated that they sat us in the room upstairs...mind you it was only noon, but we (all friends that met at college) were having a great time catching up, so it was great to not have the extra resteraunt background noise...and for everyone else in the joint, probably to their advantage also!"
PF Changs in Vegas is in a great location but the food was dissappointing.  The food was very salty.  I expected more!
"I really liked my dish, i did not remember the name but it was big enough for two, the flavor amazing and it looks good so you can love it just by seeing it! 

Great relationship between price and quality! Next time i am in USA, any city definitively i will eat there"
Went here with my Wife for one of our lunches while in Vegas.  Your typical awesome Americanized Chinese food.
"Must have the lettuce wraps! The fire alarm went off and no one did much, after 5 minutes of loud ringing it got shut down. No one understood much but it was just an anectode! Wonderful strawberry, cucumber and lime drink!"
"What can I say? It's exactly like every other PF Changs you've eaten in. The food was good, the bill was reasonable. The outdoor seating lets you watch the freak show walk by. My wife and I had fun."
"We thought we'd go stereotypical and ordered Kung pao chicken which though a little on the salty side, was fragrant and delicious.  The Beef a la Sichuan, (aka deep fried beef strips) was passable.  All mains come with white or brown rice.
The hot and sour soup was good, but order a cup, not a bowl, unless you have at least 4 at the table."
"Although located  in the Planet Hollywood casino, the restaurant is completely separate and self contained so one doesn't hear the noise or smell the cigarette smoke. We shared a lettuce wrap for an appetizer and had the Thai noodle special as entrée. Excellent food. Fast friendly and efficient service."
"Our server was amazing, she was quick, courteous and made some great recommendations. Loved the Tuna Tanaki and the salad wraps"
"Now that we have discovered this reastaurant we will not go to Vegas without eating there, it is that good.  We have went our last 3 trips and have never been disappointed, in fact, I enjoy it more everytime I go!  Service is fantastic and food is so tasty!!!  Centrally located on the strip so pretty easy to get to.  My only complaint would be that seldom can you ever walk up without having to wait for a table.  Not a big deal and definitely worth the wait.  Obviously, everybody else loves this restaurant as well!!!!!!"
"P.F. Chang's has a reputation of fantastic food and service. The food did not disapoint, but the service was a little slow the night we were there. I also found it quite inconvenient to have to walk so far for the restroom (located in Planet Hollywood Casino) from the upstairs dining room. Not a deal breaker, but inconvenient none-the-less."
I recently took some of my business associates to PF Changs for dinner. The atmosphere was very good as are all of this restaurant chain's locations. We each ordered our different meals which showed a wide diversity on its menu. The food was super! Everyone loved their meals. The service was awesome. This restaurant did not disappoint us for a great meal at a reasonable price. We love PF Changs.
This was amazing Chinese food. It is in Planet Hollywood and there is so much action around its very neat. I enjoyed the appetizers we ordered and the food was sooo good.
We really enjoyed dinner here. Was good to share entrees and mains over a couple of cocktails looking over the strip. Staff friendly and attentive. Would defiantly go back
I really enjoy the food at this restaurant.  The chinese food is great and I'm Asian!  Lots of vegetarian options too.
"Anytime i've been to PF Changs, it's always been a good experience.  This last time we went was no different.  Great service, food was good and prices were reasonable."
"This Restaurant was a total surpise in Vegas, located within Planet HollyWood Complex, it had a fantastic ambience with ground floor indoor or outdoor seating and a mezzanine floor indoors too.

Staff are fantastic, friendly and certainly there to help you enjoy your meal.

The outstanding thing here was the price of their fixed price menu for 2. I can't recall precisely how much it was but so cheap for four courses we had to clarify with the waiters. When it came we struggled to eat our chosen dishes, in fact despite my huge appetite i could not manage a dessert. You can eat full a la carte here if you want but my advice would be go for the menu for two option, you will not regret it.

Although busy service was top notch, food everything I expected and more.

Only downside and this applies to a lot of the Casino restaurants in Vegas, No washrooms in the restaurant, you have to take a hike into the Casino to find facilities."
We only had an appetizer but they did well and had great service.  It was just a late night snack with a couple beers.  Nice and clean and a good atmosphere to rest for a while
"We eat Chinese/Oriental food a lot but found this meal very average, the portions were fine but the flavors were too rich and seemingly not fresh. The service was both friendly and attentive but it's the food which means we wouldn't go again."
"The location is perfect (at the Planet Hollywood hotel). The staff was very friendly and attentive. I visited the restaurant twice (lunch & dinner). I must say that enjoyed it better for lunch because the place was not very busy, the service was faster and the table where we were seated was great. However, the dinner time was a little dissapointing in terms of waiting time for the food. It took over 35 minutes to serve the food for the 7 of us. Some tables that ordered after we did were served 10-12 minutes before..."
"I got there a little later than i had intended as i was going to see Marc Savard at the V theater  next door (excellent show b.t.w.) so i sat at the bar, which let me tell you is a good idea as you get very well looked after, & constant free refills if you have a soft drink... the hostess was very nice, & more than happy to accommodate me, the bar staff were great, chatty, welcoming, & friendly...
the food was excellent, if you like things a little spicy, go for the dynamite prawns, they are amazing, & very nicely served... then came the mu shu pork, presentation was really good, beautifully cooked & full of colour... the waitress even commented on the 'interesting system' i had for wrapping... 2 courses, excellent service, fantastic food & my bill was less than $30 with 2 refills, very nice interior, good atmosphere, simply cannot fault it"
"The food always seems to be,good here,, but the waiter seemed a little distracted. I felt like he was trying to turn the table and wanted us to move on"
"My fiance and I had dinner at PF Changes at PH on Thurs and Fri evenings in Nov 2012, the former indoors, the latter on the sidewalk patio. The food and service was the usual PF Chang's GREAT. But the service on Fri 11/23 with Melissa was especially excellent. Melissa rocks!

The location is easy to find.  Right on the strip on the outside of Planet Hollywood.  The food was great.  I had the orange peel shrimp that was excellent.  The service was phenomenal.
"I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant, we ordered the set meal for two, about $45 plus a few beers at $3.50 a piece so very reasonable. The lettuce wraps and soup were my favourite dishes and the desert was just the right size to not end up feeling completely stuffed. Would definitely recommend it. (It is a long wait for a table though so we ate at the bar, same menu, more attentive service)"
"It is on the Strip, yet it is not over priced like many other food service establishments there.
The food is of high quality with many choices available. No matter which dish one picks you can have it with more spice or less to suit your taste buds.
The service is quick, informative, friendly and efficient."
Can't go wrong with PF Changs!  Sat at the bar and service was top notch!  Sea bass is the best ever!  I'm never disappointed when I dine here!
"Yes, this was my first time at P.F. Chang's, unbelievable, I know.

P.F. Chang's is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Myself and 3 pals decided to check it out for dinner. They had been previously and enjoyed it.

An hour and a half or so later, 4 hungry guys, after multiple dishes of food, a few drinks, dessert and a bill for a very reasonable $140 including tip, walked out happy and content.

I was impressed with the selection, the portions and the food itself. P.F. Chang's easily rivals the restaurants that are pretentiously overpriced and provides atmosphere, selection, great taste and value.

Definitely worth a return visit!"
As we all know PF Changs is a chain testaurant and is always a great place to eat. This restaurant was no different. We always like their Wonton Soup and Mongolian Beef. My wife has always been a fan of their Sea Bass and they always hit a Home Run.
"Once again another spectacular luncheon in Vegas at the Planet Hollywood. Mongolian beef, lettuce wrap, Phillips chicken, and some other delicious plates kept us there for over two hrs.
Bit noisy but really doesn't detract from the experience . Wish we could get one up here in Vancouver.
FYI- They have been selling some of their dishes at some major food/grocery frozen sections. Not quite the same gourmet experience,but when you need a fix....... It works."
Always good food at PF Chang's. We chose a location off the strip. Easy to get a table for five. Server was not very friendly and struggled to get the drinks to the correct person.  Food good.
"Have eaten at this PF Chang location 3 times: excellent food every time.  It's extremely busy and  obviously very popular.  If you want a quiet, romantic dinner, this might not be your best choice, but for top notch Asian at reasonable prices, this is the place."
The menu was fantastic. All the food was wonderful. The service was a bit lacking but it was also quite busy. I am going to eat here next time I go for sure.
The food was decent but it took quite a long time to actually get the food. Plus it was a little expensive for the proportion (I had mongolian beef)
the food was really good until we notice the dead cockroach..when we pointed it out no explanation or apology was given...pity because we were enjoying our food
"We loved the food here, all four of us thoroughly enjoyed this experience. Two drawbacks, there was a bit of a wait for the table so be prepared for that and the tables near the reception desk are a bit cramped and busy with clients arriving so avoid these if you can. The stuffed lettuce was to die for."
"Ate here while on a business trip for my husband's work.  We have reservations and still had to wait over 15 minutes past our reservation time and we kept on the hostess to get seated.  The food was good and the prices were not jacked up, they were the same as where we live."
"Can I put this request into the Gods of Restaurant Chains?  Get rid of all the fast-food burger places, and replace them with PF Chang's.  You would never know this is a chain restaurant if I didn't tell you.  The level of attention to the taste and presentation of the food would make you think it's a boutique restaurant.  The hot and sour soup is not to be missed!"
"PF Changs food to me is like be in the Orient and ending genuine authentic food, it is so good and priced for its quality."
Location was excellent.  Ability to make reservations (highly recommended) saved a lot of time.  Very busy restaurant but food quality remained high.  Service was excellent.  Recommendations were given and advice followed with great results.  No dislikes regarding this P.F. Chang's!
"If you've been to one PF Chang's you've pretty much been to them all.  Had cocktails and appetizers on one occasion, and then returned for dinner on a different day.  Dinner was slow and sporadic-half the table received its entrees while others were still waiting on appetizers...and so on...Then after I waited nearly 35 minutes for an order of Firecracker Shrimp, they arrived not warm at all and definitely not edible. I did enjoy the Hot and Sour soup which has the perfect balance of each flavor. The saving grace was the Chinese 88 Martini.  It packed a bang in the small glass!

If you are just looking for something to put in your stomach, then go to PF Chang's otherwise, go onto the Strip to find other options."
We had a bit of a wait to get into the restaurant for dinner but it was well worth it!  The food was excellent.  The chicken noodle soup was amazing!  For 3 people we ordered 4 dishes plus soup and we were stuffed!
Really great food and service at PF Changs. Great setting on the strip. The mongolian beef was excellent. We came back to eat here a second time. Always very busy so better to reserve. The price was also very good considering it's location! Excellent restaurant
"Love eating here when we are in a city with one! Had a problem with something in our food(not serious), and the staff addressed it quickly and professionally. Service was great. Manager attended to us after the incident, which was appreciated. Even with a full house, the wait for our dinner was very short. Very impressed."
Food is fantastic!  The service was also quick and friendly.  I have been trying to get to the restaurant in Boston and can never get there.
Too much food went to waste and money down the drain because we couldn't eat it.  Kung Pao chicken was saltier than it was spicy... we couldn't eat it.  We told the waitress and she didn't care.  Processed food... pretty nasty.
"This place is fantastic! Great ambience, great food, great prices, friendly efficient staff, what more can you ask for? Would definately recommend!"
"Having just gotten married my new husband and I decided we wanted to go somewhere nice for a meal with our friends, but not overly fancy. I can't be doing with dress codes and ""interviews"" before they seat you, that's just ridiculous.

We were greeted very warmly by our server who was incredibly helpful, even advising us that we'd probably ordered too much food and were we sure (we were, and we had....). Don't like the $10-15 price tags fool you, one entrée could probably feed two people. If you'[re thinking of getting rice or noodles with it, share an entrée and the rice! 

The cocktails were gorgeous, though I'd advised trying to hit the happy hour as $10+ per drink is a little much even for a celebration! 

The food was.. well the food was fantastic. Considering two of the four of us say they ""don't like Chinese food"" everyone was incredibly happy, with my husband declaring the seared tuna appetiser ""the best tuna I've ever had"". He's one of the two that don't like Chinese... 

My personal recommendation would be the Beef Fried Rice. I think the beef is cooked in sesame oil or something, it's completely divine and we're strongly considering heading back before we leave if we get the chance! GO! :)"
"Great atmosphere, Chang’s is always reliable for good food, great service and wonderful atmosphere.  It was my friend’s first –ever Chang’s experience, and wow, who could beat Vegas.   You must try the lettuce wraps apps, I really like the Hot and Spicy soup.  You really can’t go wrong with anything at Chang’s though. It can be pricy but certainly worth it!!!"
had a gift certificate so we went I didn't really like the flavor of the food and my rice was under cooked.  I haven't been back since. They didn't have things that I like to eat
"PF Changs is always a great choice no matter what the location. We were lucky enough to have one in our hotel( Planet Hollywood) We had the two for $44.95 special. I had the most yummy hot and sour soup. We shared some dumplings. We both had the Chang's Spicy Chicken which was crispy with a delicious, slightly spicy, slightly sweet sauce. The dessert was a nice selection of the shooter mini cakes. The tiramisu was very tasty and just a nice little bit of sweetness after a large meal. My husband also said the carrot cake was great.
The staff is friendly, the service was fairly quick, the atmosphere is lovely. They also have outdoor seating and while it would have been a lovely evening for it, there was a much longer wait for a table so we chose inside.
In Vegas, where prices are sometimes inflated and some of the food is not worth it, here you know what you're getting, a delicious meal for a decent price and great service--not a gamble at all!!!!"
Loved it. Lettuce wraps are great and so are their dishes. Be careful not too overeat as the servings are massive and the food comes out quick. May have to wait 5-10 mins but worth it
Just had to try the place as people told me to go here.Service was fairly slow even though it was almost empty.Portions were good but I found everything a bit bland.Dont think I would waste my time going bk
"Our meal was fantastic from start to finish! We had an awesome server (Yesenia) and she took very good care of us! The food was excellent-phad tai, spicy chicken dish, shrimp and the side dish of asparagus was really wonderful."
"I eat at PF Changs quite often throughout the year. This trip was a company dinner with many of our International customers. We had the people at PF's set up a food buffet and I must say, the food was great. The service was great and the overall experience was great."
"We sat on the outdoor patio and ""people watched"" while we enjoyed the AWESOME food. We will go back again!"
"My husband and I love PF Changs, we have been to numerous locations across the US, including this location. When we travel we seek out this restaurant because we have always had good service and good food. We visited this location on October 27 and have to say our experience was awful. We were with another couple and were seated on the patio along the strip, met our waiter and placed our order. We waited for quite a while and then our appetizers arrived along with our dinners. Obviously we wanted to eat the soup and other appi's first so they took the dinners away. We finished the appetizers and our waiter informed us the dinners should be up soon, we informed him they were brought out earlier and he had no idea that had happened. He went to find out where the main meals were and we didn't see him again. One of our dinner companions talked to a manger to find out what was going on and not soon after we got the meals. The one meal was not what was ordered and I had ordered an appetizer as my meal, but that had come out earlier so we watched the other two eat their main meals. The managers came close to the table but never spoke to us, our waiter was absent once again until he brought the bill and said we wouldn't be charged for the meal that wasn't correct and cancelled. He said this like it was a big deal but we assumed we wouldn't have to pay for something we never actually received anyway. We paid the bill, left no tip and were disappointed that not one person ever appologized for the slow service or mix ups. Probably will be awhile before we visit PF Changs again."
"We were in Vegas for a week and ate at PF Changs 3 times...it was sensational! The prices are very reasonable, especially the happy hour between 5 & 6pm and the servings are very generous. Even a midnight snack after a show of Wonton soup was great and to get out of a Restaurant for under $10 absolutely satisfied speaks for itself. Loved it!"
"This is by far our favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.  We recommend the Happy Hour where you can each have a great drink, a great menu ( we like the crispy green beans, lettuce wraps and crab wontons) and still have a total bill less than $30 for 2 people.  We've found nowhere in Vegas as good"
As allways the food is great. We waited 15 minutes for our tea. Appetiser came at different times waited another 10 minute for refill on the tea. Service was just bad.....
"Im very much a fan of this chain and the location in Planet Hollywood did not disappoint. Fast and good service, short wait time, great food and extremely affordable."
"Price, serving sizes and quality were all exceptional. We ate there 3 times and each meal was sensational. There's a Happy Hour 5-6pm, where you can get great priced drinks and food. But, even if you get there later than this, it's still fantastic value."
"Popped in more some good quality Asian food on a lunchtime. Good outside setting area to watch the world go by.
Had a Thai chicken noodle salad, which I would have preferred more spicy, but it was very tasty all the same. Good value eats."
"Have eaten here in other citys and this ones no different very good with good service. It was nice to sit outside and watch the
people."
"We had dinner at P.F. Chang's China Bistro on our last visit. We had the 45$-4 course menu for 2. The food was excellent, the dumplings we're the best i've ever eaten. The mongolina beef was also fantastic. We had a wedding party next to us so it was very noisy but we still enjoyed our meal. I highly recommend"
"Food is delicious and tasty. Great selection of all Asian delights plus a little bit more.
We did have to wait about 1/2 an hour for a table, but the wait was worth it. Service was great and staff very friendly.
Good value for money too!"
"We had lunch at PF Changs. Lettuce wraps were great along with the almond and cashew chicken. My wife loves the spicy and hot wontons, but she said they were doughy and not quite right. They credited us the charge and were very apologetic.  Specialty drinks were very good and service was outstanding. Ask for Joey's section."
"the food was not worth the wait. we walked all the way from our hotel the Aria, and was really excited about this meal, it was just wrong, totally boring.  i am now turned off."
"We had a really good meal at P.E. Chang's on Paradise.  We were able to get the whole grain rice we prefer.  The menu was varied and it took us a long time to choose, but we were pleased with the entrees we chose.  Afterwards I was looking on the net to find another location close to where I live."
"Me and my girlfriend first visited here on a friends recommendation back in 2009 and loved it so much that when we were back in Vegas again we made sure to stop by and things are still as good as as we remembered. There is almost always a wait but by the time you have a drink at the bar your table is ready, as i mentioned in the title if its an extra 10 minutes wait for a table outside then do it as you get to watch the bellagio fountains which a nice thing to have in the background whilst you eat your meal. We was also out with my girlfriends parents and they really enjoyed the food as well with the best part being the bill at the end which was really reasonable (about $120 for four with a few drinks and appetizers). Added note that the portions are quite big (as with nearly every place i eat in the US!) so if you aren't that big an eater i would avoid appetizers altogether"
I ate here twice in one week. The food was delicious & the vegetables are so tasty. The staff are really attentive & friendly. Probably the best service I had in Vegas. I would definately recommend this restaurant for value for money & you get a doggy bag if you can't eat it all!
"This is not a Chinese restaurant, at least they do not serve real Chinese food.  They have one sauce that they use on everything --at least that we ordered. Everything tasted bland, no garlic or fresh ginger at all. The sauce that they used is a mild, tomatoey sweet/sour sauce that gives a vapid illusiong of oriental cooking, but is not."
"Anothar chain restaurant... but very good. In Vegas, very crowded but worth the waiting time... Fried rice, perfect and a beer at your choice completes the meal..."
"The food was very good and the service very quick, and it was easily booked from our room via the telephone."
Every time we go to Vegas we hit up pf changs. We had a party of 9 and we only needed to Oder 5 main dishes. More than enough to share. Of course we 4 Orders of crab wantons as an appy
"Friends recommended we try PF Chang's on our next visit to Vegas and we were really impressed with the quality of the food and good prices.  We were told that we must try the chicken lettuce wraps on the appetizer menu and we loved them, in fact, we'd go back specifically to have these.  Service was excellent, food was fresh, hot, and delicious.  We were pleasantly surprised considering it is a chain restaurant."
"We dined here before going to see Peep Show at Planet Hollywood. All the food was delicious especially the fried pork won ton starter, pepper beef, garlic noodles and the banana fritter dessert."
It was convienient to our hotel and we were hungry and you can't go wrong with PF Changs. We sat outside which I would highly recommend
"The food was salty... not really edible... the hot and sour soup was not sour nor hot... it was salty... the garlic spinach and salty... some of them weren't cooked properly... also got a chicken pad Thai:  the noodles was ok but them again the chicken was way too salty... its like someone accidentally drop a cup of salt into every dish. 

We asked the manager to come over because we really couldn't eat any of them. We ended up only had to pay for the dumpling (which wasn't that great) and tipped the server for the effort...

At the end i would say that these are not authentic chinese food at all... don't know why the need of yhr saltiness either..."
"Love PF chiang, reasonably priced with lots of selection for everyone to choose from. High on salt though!"
"So many items we like on their menu, it's nearly impossible to choose.  This year, again, they have new items on and their Caramelised Chicken with Mangos was brilliant.  Very busy and yet service is always very good."
I was staying at Planet Hollywood for a one day meeting and decided to grab a meal just after arriving.  P.F. Chang's is connected to the hotel.  The service was excellent and because I caught a Happy Hour so the prices were good.  The atmosphere was relaxed and I had a great view of the Strip from my table.
"Have walked past this establishment several times on past trips thinking it wasn't worth considering, but based on Tripadvisor reviews, decided to give it a go and we were not disappointed.
The food was freshly prepared, flavourful and absolutely wonderful.  Try the lamb main dishes-you won't be disappointed and as for the appetizers, do give the lettuce wraps a try-they are worth the effort, hands down. 
The servers were excellent and very attentive to our needs.  We asked for a booth and there was no hesitation in accommodating us despite it being towards the end of happy hour.  
The value for food and drinks is very good as well and in fact, is some of the best that we've found on the strip.  Two appetizers, two mains with two side orders of veggies, plus two beers and two martini's came to $80 without tip-very good value on the strip!
Just a note though...PK Chang's is true to its name and serves Chinese and a bit of Asian fusion....if you are looking for fries and a burger, you've got the wrong place..."
Great food and service. They also have a happy hour where you get appt. Half price. We tried these one day and that was the reason we went bsck for a meal. Only downside is its very busy and you may have to wait half an hour for a seat.
"Walked into Chang's right after sunday night football.  There were 3-4 groups in front of us at hostess all giving 20 minute waits.  Gets to our turn and they tell us if we want to sit outside we could sit now.....yes please.  Outside has more atmosphere anyways and sun was down so it wasn't hot.  Ordered the price fix for two..two apps, two entrees, two desserts less than 50 bucks.  It was best dining experience at any PF Changs Ive ever been too, highly recommend."
"Ate here with my wife late September. We loved the food but with only two of us could only sample a spicy chicken and a stir fried beef dish. Both were excellent, fantastic taste and generous portions. Rice was white pilaf or brown, both nice but not very large servings. In the UK the most popular rice is egg fried rice but this was surprisingly not an option. 
We ordered an appetiser but they overlooked it so we never got it.
That was disappointing having believed the service to be good in this restaurant.
We would definitely return if we fancied Chinese food and at peak"
"We often crave rice on our vacations and here is a good place to get it. Classy asian fusion at a reasonable price for vegas food. A few bucks more on the strip than PF changs off the strip. We went with the prix fixe menu which includes two soups, an appetizer, two entrees, and two shooter style desserts. Way too much food for us. We highly recommend the mongolian beef, kung pao chicken was pretty decent. We would not recommend the crispy green beans, kind of a soggy tasteless batter. The calamari we had last time was way better. Hot and sour soup was also very tasty."
The meal was excellent the best ribs I have ever tasted. The server was really helpful. He stopped us wasting money by ordering more than we could eat. Huge portions. Great quality. I would go back in a second.
"PF Changs in Planet Hollywood is ok, a little overpriced but you are paying for the atmoshere, I would recommend reservations, go in the morning around 11:00 or 12:00 to make reservations for that night. It isn't the best chinese food that i've had but it's ok. Try the lettuce wrps"
"Almost every time I go to Vegas, I dine at PF Changs.   Even though they have locations in my town, when in Vegas, dining is expensive.  PF Changs is consistently priced and delivers a good meal for the money spent.  The location at Planet Hollywood is convenient, and last time I was there, they had PBR for a few bucks.  They do accept reservations."
"Firstly be prepared to wait for a table. On both of our visits we had to wait around 30 minutes.  However a drink from the bar and time flew by. 

We have to say that this was the best meal we had by far on our holiday.  Prices of drinks are particularly good value. 

Portions are large and quality of the food is excellent. 

We shared the lettuce wrap as an appetiser which was excellent. We then shared a main course (crispy honey chicken) and double fried noodles with vegetables   Rice comes with the main course. All of which was more than sufficient for the two of us."
"This is a well located restaurant which offers a pleasant dining experience for solo diners,  couples, or groups.
The food is tasty, the wait staff is friendly and very helpful. The prices are reasonable for eating on the strip.
We always go here when in Las Vegas."
Service and food excellent. Second visit to this restaurant. Was able to book ahead on their website.
"We didnt need to book for a table, Just turned up and waited about 5 minutes for a table, The cocktails were amazing and rather cheap comapred to other restaurants.

We had Chicken Noodle soup to start and it was the nicest Soup i have ever tasted, The only criticism would be that we did wait a while but it was well worth the wait!

We both ordered soup an appetizer and a main and we would have only needed one of each, the portions are massive!

Overall a lovely restaurant and great value for money!"
"If you're wanting real food, go here. Cheap meals for the quality. Only $50 fed us both appies, entrees, deserts."
"This is one of THE best spots when your hungry, want good food and at a reasonable price. Always great. Location can't be better and if your staying anywhere near, call ahead and get it to go. Great jobs folks."
"My Husband and I stopped in to eat a light lunch since we had dinner plans that I knew would be a heavy meal. 

We sat at the bar and received wonderful service from the bartender.  Food was wonderful and service was great!"
"Lovely food with great prices and large portions. 

Had chicken black bean and sweet and sour chicken 

Good service.  Had a seat outside on the terrace."
"Saturday was so buzy, but they have a bistro area in the back, we got right in and the food was amazing so was the service it's great if it's just two of you, you have to ask for it, other wise a 30 min wait"
"I have never ordered anything at P.F. Chang's that I did not love.  My husband had the seasoned broccoli and shrimp with a side order of spring rolls and I had the Mandarin Chicken and a side of the seasoned (soy) cucumbers.  The food the excellent.  The service was a tad bit slow due to a large group he had to handle along with us but he was fast enough and we did not have a real problem.

As always, for me, the food is a little too salty but my husband found that part perfect so I have to say this is just me.  The waiter offered to box our leftovers and we took him up on that and my husband had a great lunch yesterday.

The only reason I did not give this a full ""excellent"" rating was not really a problem of the restaurant -- well, we were a couple dining alone and they perhaps could have placed us in a better spot -- the group next to us was LOUD.  And the other table had people using their cellphones,  I think restaurants need to forbid cellphone usage as people using them are always several decibels louder than other people but who in the world needs cellphone usage 24 hours a day and, when you are at dinner, you should have the good manners to at least pretend you want to be with your own group and not talking to someone else.

That aside, great experience and good food and above-average service."
"This is such a great restaurant that we went back a second time. I must congratulate our waiter, Danny who made the experience more pleasurable. His advice about the various menu items was what I would hope to see in a restaurant at my side of the world. You will not be disappointed when you visit this restaurant. WARNING - this place is so popular either go there and reserve a table or get your concierge to do it for you."
"Food as usual was loverly, the service was spot on, we where brought an extra main course for free which was nice. There is seating indoors and out but there is often a wait for a table but it is always worth it. The service was spot on and food a reasonable price, overall try to eat there when you have a chance"
Worth visiting if you happen to be passing by and want something not-too-filling and tasty. The service is good. The ginger beer was something refreshing and different (non-alcoholic) on a hot day. I'd go there again.
We had an excellent meal.  We were seated in an extremely noisy area though and asked to be moved to a booth.  We were told it would another 20-25 minutes but we said we still wanted to move.  We went out to wait and we were moved 5 mintes later to a booth.  The food was excellent though.
the barstaff were so frienly accommodating'had dinner at the bar you get served very fast and enjoy the bar company
"We went here by chance as we were having a night walking down the strip and wanted a restaurant with a strip view we were going to go to the strip house but after reading the reviews and they don't have a strip view now we happened to call here, we got a table outside a small view of the strip , we ordered our starters which were excellent but when we ordered the starters we asked for half hour grace between starters and main which we always do , waiter said yes that's fine they don't start cooking it until u have finished our starter, but no we had just stopped eating our starter and another waiter came with the main, we had not even had our plates taken!! Apparently they cook your main as soon as they have given you a starter !! So the waiter had not taken any notice at all ! We carried on eating the food was very good but we were stuffed and felt rushed."
"Great Location! Very busy yet they manage the dinner crowds with ease.  This chain is always consistently good, even in Vegas where the volume of people is never ending.  Comfortable seating, good service, tasty food and reasonable prices."
"I was in Vegas for a conference in June and just happened I had some PF Chang gift cards (two adding up to $35 worth) that have been in my wallet for some time.  My friends and I walked over to PF Changs from MGM Grand - Very walkable distance and great spot on The Strip.  We had to wait for 20 minutes for our table, but we were given one of those vibrating, light-flashing coasters to let us know when our table was ready, so we went outside to wait and people watch until our table was ready.  Awesome dry desert heat, interesting people, and view.

We got a great booth and the service was awesome.  I asked if I could apply both gift cards to our total bill and he said of course I could. Win! :) The meals were reasonably priced and took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table.  We all ordered something different and I was hankering for some noodles.  Not sure what I ordered but I think it was deep friend noodles that were then stir fried.  What was I thinking...Anyway, the sauce was thick and the meal sat heavy in my tummy.  The food wasn't super duper in my book, but then I've only had one dish there so far.  Nothing super spectacular about the food that we ordered but we loved the restaurant, location, and service.  You can't beat that!  Oops, wait.  My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was actually fresh and delicious looking.  I will definitely go to PF Changs again to give it another try and we have one here in Seattle.  Next time I will try something less fried.  It's definitely worth checking out if you are in Vegas for the experience, price, and decent menu.  I did love the iced tea, though. Very refreshing. :)"
"PF Changs in Vegas on Paradise and Flamingo is fantastic. I have always had a great experience at every PF Changs I visit. This restaurant is clean, service is good and the food tastes great. It's busy in the later evening, but if you go between 5-6pm you are seated almost immediately. I always visit this restaurant as its off the strip and is easy to get to from my hotel."
"very busy but they accomodated us and food was very tasty, so much so I had what I couldn't eat for breakfast the next day!"
"Good location in the middle of the strip. Restaurant has two levels so there are lots of tables and staff. Service was great, and the Mongolian beef is a must have. For a chain restaurant this place is pretty good! And the cocktails aren't too bad there either."
"PF Chang's is always a must when we visit Vegas.  I recommend this place to everyone as the food is always fantastic/hot and awesome price.  You definately will not leave here hungry.  They change the menu up quite often, but the favorites always remain.  Their lettuce wraps and Mongolian beef are always great.

Be prepared to wait a while usually - or make a reservation - you won't be sorry."
"I LOVE PF Changs! Food was excellent, price was on point, and we even had left overs. 

The service on the other had was very, very slow even though the restaurant wasn't busy (mid afternoon). 

Not uniquely Vegas, but if you want good food, it's always worth it. Hopefully, you'll get a different server!"
"I've been to quite a few of their locations and have never left disappointed. Our experience this time was comparable to the others with a bit more of a wait which was expected on the Vegas strip. Food great, service mediocre."
Have eaten here on two separate holidays. Food does not disappoint. Large portions compared to UK so be careful how much you order. Had a table upstairs overlooking the Strip. Would recommend to everyone
I absolutely loved my dinner here...it was amazing!!!  The ammount of food you get for the price is excellent and the service was super quick!!
"I guess I expected a little more flavor in my dish - however my familys dishes seemed a lot better. My dish was dry like it was leftovers or has been sitting out or something. The flavor was pretty good but I liked someone elses food better in my group.
I really felt that it was over rated 
Very crowded. So much going on. When we asked questions - the server looked at us like we were ridiculous for asking such a question like we should know better.  
I would definately give it another chance"
My family and I strolled over to Planet Hollywood to have a late supper after watching the Water show at the Bellagio fountains. We didn't have to wait long to be seated and the food/orders came quickly. The food and the view of the strip were both terrific. Great restaurant.
"We made reservations about a week or two ahead of my daughters wedding in Vegas and they did not disappoint.  We got fantastic service for a party of 9.  The food was fantastic, we all shared and enjoyed appetizers, drinks and dinner.  I had cupcakes delivered right to the restaurant and they delivered them to the table after dinner.  Very memorable experience."
"Great place for chinese fod, excellent atmosphere, the best value for your money and food the best, service friendly and casual  i will go again"
"I know everyone has one of these in thier town. But this one has a great happy hour during the week and portions are perfect, Service was excellent."
"Nice and light lunch was a perfect piece to the afternoon- friendly staff and management.  
Started with the egg drop soup (PF has some of the best I've ever had) The Orange Chicken was crispy and not overly battered.  Husband had the Mongolian Beef...he probably could have had more- he loved it.
Wontons and sauce were best eaten warm, right when served"
"I know everyone has one of these in thier town. But this one has a great happy hour during the week and portions are perfect, Service was excellent."
"Good food, good service, always a good time at PF Changs! The lettuce wraps are to die for! Even though this is a chain restaurant, it's still one of my favs! The desserts aren't too bad either! My favorite dish is the szcehuan chicken. If you never have eaten here though-keep in mind, what is listed is what you get. If you like vegetablews, and they arent listed in the description-you can add them to your dish for a few dollars!"
Amazing food great flavours only downside by the casino lovely waiter and waitresses really nice meal
"I usually LOVE Pf Changs, I visit the Chicago restaurant a few times a year. Chicago always has great food and great service. That being said, walking in on a friday evening we expected it to be busy and knew we would be waiting. We checked in with the hostess and they looked at us like ""what could you possibly want"". We were quoted 20-30 min for a table and given a beeper. We went to the casino and had some fun. Realized it had been 35+ min and wondered if maybe we had went a little too far in the casino for the beeper and wanted to check in with the hostess again to just be sure we still were in line for a table. I nicely asked if the beepers worked in the casino and got 100% attitude and was told ""I told you it would be more than 30 min, and you still have at least 5!"" with rolled eyes. I said sorry and went back out into the casino. About 10 min later we were paged. Again the hostess not very nice. She sent us upstairs to find another hostess. In the meantime making our way through the restaurant, my friend was almost pushed over by a bus person who was obviously in some kind of hurry to get to the other side of the restaurant. No sorries were heard. We finally made it to our table, our waitress was very nice but obviously very busy. We ordered beers which had to come from the downstairs bar which took a good while. We got our food quickly. The food was the most horrible thing we've ever eaten it tasted spoiled and covered in salt. I ordered the Honey Chicken and it was sour tasting and my friend ordered the pan crispy noodles and it tasted like pure salt. We ate a few bites and were done. Probably the worst experience I've ever had with food and service all together in a restaurant that I was paying a good chunk of change to. WILL NOT BE BACK! BEWARE!!!"
"Great location, entrance just off the strip and straight into the PH casino! The food was delicious and service fast and friendly, we had lettuce wraps to start! Delicious! Good value for money too!"
Excellent food. i love their Won tong soup. I've placed to go orders and still had to wait on them which is discouraging. I've found that the servers seem to have too many tables so every time i've eaten inside it takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours for lunch
"Very nice establishment, huge portions, if your not used to eating a lot would suggest 1 meal between 2, 
wasn't cheap but wasn't exactly over priced either, 
a nice treat :)"
"Having experienced fabulous food and service at the P F Changs in Florida, we were looking forward to eating here. Our first visit was like a comedy sketch with the waiter forgetting to order our main meals and before the starters arrived, asked us if we wanted dessert! Our  starters then arrived at the same time as the main meals.  They were very slow in clearing the tables so we were surrounded by tables of dirty plates. We thought we'd give them a second chance on our last night if the holiday but it was just as bad. I wouldn't recommend eating here and won't return on my next trip to Vegas."
Ate here 3 times and ordered food service from here. ALL choices excellently prepared. I like clean food simply prepared to highlight the taste of that food item. PF Chang's does just that!
"Having not had a Chinese meal for months I was delighted to find out this place offered Gluten free options. The gluten free menu was very good- lots of choice. I chose the Chicken lettuce wraps to start followed by Chang's spicy chicken with fried rice. Wow!!! Absolutely delicious. Food was full of flavour, really tasty and such large portions. Our server, Paul, was great and really helpful. We had such a lovely meal here and hope that PF Chang's opens up in Scotland! Highly recommend."
Having heard the name many times we had never had the opportunity to eat here.  A local friend of ours wanted to have dinner with us in Vegas and we went there on his recommendation.  In a word are we ever glad he did.  The food was fantastic and the price reasonable for more food than we could eat.  Both times we went there on our vacation we ended up taking food with us.  In short well worth the trip.  We left completely satisfied and will be back again on our next trip
Always love PF Chang's but this trip on the strip was better than excellent!  We had the best waitress EVER and the food was amazing.  So glad we visited - better than a buffet and the best service ever.
"We were in town for a very short time period and spent way too much of it here waiting for our food.  We like the brand and it is always good, but our lunch portions were pretty small.  Nice location, strip on one side, casino on the other."
"This PF Changs is better than the rest. The food was outstanding. I had the Kung Pao Shrimp and it aw seasoned to perfection. My wife does not usually like spicy food, but she enjoyed eating the shrimp of my plate. Good beer selection too."
This is my favourite restaurant. It may not be the best restaurant in the world but i love it here. The food is good and i always look forward to going back. Menu is varied and everything i have tried has been fantastic. Just go!!!!!!!
I celebrated my birthday here with free lettuce wraps (I joined the eclub).  Not too spicy and the service is always top notch.
Visited this place after rreading otherreviws on TA.  We eat at six and had mo problem getting a table. we made the mistake of ordering two starters between four of us. We were unable todinish our meals and althogh the waiter offered to parcel up what we failed to eat we had no fridge!
Not a place worth visiting. Everything is obviously frozen and service was mediocre at best. Save your money and go to Yolos Mexican in Planet Hollywood instead. Much better food.
This was my sixth time to eat at this restaurant and it was as usual wonderful!!!  The food and service was great!!!  P.F. Changs is one of my favorite places to eat.  My favorite dish is shrimp pan fried noodles!!!
"Arrived late in Vegas and looking for something to ear.
So happy we found this peace.
Everything was great and what a surprise when our bill was only $32 .00. 

Will Definatly be going back before we leave."
"Very busy so had to book. As usual, P F's did not let us down. Glorious food, but as usual, ate too much, couldn't leave any could we??  Chicken wraps.......mmmmmmm"
"I had a very nice experience at this restaurant. I haven't ate at a P.F. Chang's before so I'm not sure how it compares with the pricing elsewhere. What I can say, though, is that the waiter was very friendly and the food was excellent. We ate there at about 9 or 10 at night. The wait was about an hour, but it was very crowded so what else can you expect? I'm not sure if they take reservations but I would advise you to make some if they do just to be on the safe side!"
"The menu has some extra or different items than our usual local PFC but it's not bad if you're looking for something familiar.  Also, it's slightly cheaper than eating inside any of the fancier hotels.  We had a slight problem with our server, but the management resolved it quite well.  I can't resist those dumplings and lettuce wraps! :)"
"The food and menu is the same as any other PF Chang's that I've been too, even the prices. The M-F 3-6 happy hour is good and if you can handle the heat, sit outside for a nice view of the Bellagio Fountains and to people watch."
"Waited almost 1 hour but when we got in and ad our meal, I would have waited all day. Superb The food and service was of the highest standard"
"Just love PF Chang's.  Great food, great service, and sitting on the patio when the weather is perfect cannot be beat."
"I am the first to admit that P.F. Chang is ""Americanized"" Chinese food. However, the food and service here over Memorial Day weekend was very good. Even though the place was packed, we were seated very quickly (Diamond status helped). The food was very good and the service could not have been better."
Go for the Happy Hour from 3-6pm when they have great prices on drinks and appetizers.  An 18% tip is automatically added to the check whether or not the service is good.  Luckily our server was attentive.  The food was the same as any other P.F. Chang's.
"PF Changs in Vegas was singularly the WORST so called Asian food we have ever eaten.  When you throw in the awful service, it's a place that we wouldn't go back to even if they said it was free and we were the only people in the restaurant!!
My Chicken in black bean sauce was actually just overcooked bits of chicken in a plain brown gravy that had zero flavour, not even chicken!  We would have complained but it would have meant us staying in the restaurant for another hour just waiting for a manager to see us!!  Awful awful place.  We have been to vegas 14 times and have eaten in a real mix of good food, cheap food and fast food places and Changs was the worst in Vegas.  I'd rather eat in Panda Express!!
Avoid like the plague."
"Well, we chose this restaurant based on the all 5-star reviews on tripadvisor but was rather disappointed with the food quality.  To start with, taste of the Oolong tea we ordered was far different from what we expected even though the waiter gave us a second pot together with the teabag label ""Dragon Eye Oolong"".  Secondly, the ""hot and sour soup"" was neither hot nor sour, but heavily salted and looks like soya sauce instead.  Entrees of fried rice and beef with broccoli tasted ok, somewhat on the greasy side.  
Overall service was good (friendly staff and the waiter took the soup off our bill), cosy atmosphere and reasonably priced, but maybe the food was better suited for non-Chinese customers."
"The best chinesse food I ever ate in my life, must visit, staff is very helpful to suggest what to order if it's your first visit, my fav is lettuce wrap chicken,"
This was sooooo good. There was coupons in our room for a free appy so we headed down and the appy was free and gooood.  Usually you only get a small appy but thus was a fair size for being free. Also the meal itself did not disappoint us. The flavor of every dish was very distinct. Maybe ask for no MSG if possible.
We had dinner with friends and it was great!  Our waiter was swift and friendly.  The food was delicious!  Location is in the Plantet Hollywood Casino.
Every course was delicious and besides not realising I was dipping into a very hot chilli sauce and our drinks hadn't come out just yet - it was great! The bill hurt but I'd say it was worth it and good service too.
"Loved this place. The atmosphere was great the service was great and the food was amazing!
I highly recommend the lettuce wraps, they were so good we had to order more.
We originally had reservations at 8PM but showed up at 5:30PM and they had no problem getting us right in.  Can't wait to go back,"
"We kept hearing about how great the food was, and all we heard was true.  The service was unbeatable.  This was a crew that was on it!  Also, the food quality couldn't have been.  we had the orange chicken and a salmon dish that was fantastic, followed by the biggest piece of cake hey had.  And the cake was good too.  We will look for P.F. Chang's in other areas now!"
"We were in Vegas for my son's 21st birthday, and a group of 7 took him to PF Chang's.  We have one at home, and I still think it's the best place for Kung Po Shrimp.  The wait staff were very attentive and brought the obligatory candle in his dessert."
"We made a reservation for 8pm and were told a 5-10 minute wait was to be expected. We waited for 30 minutes for a table and when we challenged staff over this they claimed to have called us, despite the fact our pager never went off, and we never left the waiting area. 

We were then seated our order was taken but the starters came 10 minutes apart. When the ribs finally came (they were delicious - the only thing edible) they arrived 60 seconds before the mains. Utterly disgraceful service. 

The food was awful, except the ribs. I would not feed it to my dogs. The spring rolls tasted rank and the chicken was nothing but gristle and cartilage. 

Steer clear folks!!! There are much better restaurants on the strip. Don't waste your dollars here!!!"
"This wasn't the best Chinese I've had, but it is tasty, the prices are reasonable, and most importantly, the portions are generous. I bought lunch (2 appetizers, 1 entree) & had enough left over for dinner."
"The interior was noisy due to use of sound-reflecting laminates and chaotic due to kitchen traffic running through the waiting area by the host desk, but food was quite good.  Great effort to satisfy those in our group with food allegies.  Had a preplanned ""Allergy Matrix"" to assess and avoid cross contamination.  Duck Duo was world class, tender and succulent."
We love this restaurant! The lettuce wraps are a must for an appetizer. Entree portions are large and the food is delicious!
We had dinner at P.F. Chang's which was really good! We had one of the most friendly waiters we met during our trip though the south west of the US. The food we had was also very good! Definately a must go when you're in Vegas and like to eat Asian food.
"we didnt book so couldnt get a table but we managed to grab a spot at the bar and we really enjoyed that experience as it was more social .

The food was great, the service was good expecially being seated at the bar, and the prices where reasonable"
They went out of their way to make our table excellent food for people who had allergies
"Absolutely best Chinese fusion I've ever had... We booked a couple of hours ahead of the rush thank goodness, usually there's a long wait.."
"After a long day, wasn't in the mood to venture out.  When you know the menu and just want to sit and order, they deliver."
This is a lovely restaurant in the Planet Hollywood Hotel. The food is delicious and they even have a gluten free menu and cater well for vegetarians.
Food was very average for a Chinese restaurant. Chicken cooked with soya was on the verge of being burnt. Green beans were covered in so much chilli and soya they were swimming and barely edible. The noodle dish was ok. Service was good though and wait was much quicker than we were initially advised. I would try elsewhere.
"This restaurant offered very good food and the prices were very reasonable. We were staying in Planet Hollywood so the ease of access was very simple, I am a Vegetarian and sometimes struggle to dine out as I am very fussy with food but had no real problems finding cuisine here and would return again on my next visit to PH!"
"We lunched here, and loved it!!! Went on recommendations from friends and not disappointed!!! The lettuce wraps were recommended by our server and were fantastic, so much so that I can bareky remember the spicy chicken I had and have completely forgotten what the Mrs had. The prices were reasonable and the drinks selection good. Drinks were expensive but all are considered expensive when you can sit 20m from the restaurant, gamble and get drinks for nothing!!"
"I had never been to a pf chang's but I'm glad I stopped by this one. The restaurant was so busy but I got seated within 10 minutes. I wasn't sure what to decide upon. My waiter, even though it was so unbelievably busy, took the time to describe three different dishes on the menu until I chose the right one and it was delicious. fantastic service and right at planet hollywood."
I have wanted to visit this place on previous visits to vegas but could never get in.  The food is excelletn quality and there is plenty of choice
"If you need to boost your sodium intake enough to frighten your doctor, or if you want to eat faux chinese food that is tailored to a white bread-trailer trash palate, then P.F. Chang's is for you. I'm from the pacific northwest where we have an abundance of Asian cuisine, cooked by Asian chefs. If you're the kind of person who feels that you've experienced Europe by visiting the backlot of Universal Studios, then P.F. Chang's is for you.

Oh, and nice try, all you P.F. Chang's employees who have submitted all the positive reviews for this establishment."
It was incredibly busy and had to wade through a sea of people to check in.  It was just a few minutes and they sat us at a great table and we had a fabulous meal.  Our waitress made us feel like VIP's and we can't wait to go back!
"I came here for lunch with a friend, and it was so-so. Not mind-blowing. However, I'd been impressed enough to come back with family for an evening meal and it was absolutely outstanding. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it for the view of the strip from upstairs. Our waitress was friendly and informative and made some excellent recommendations. The Crab rice is beautiful, the portions are huge. I had to double take when the bill came - we were stuffed, and drinks, starters, two entrees and a side came to just over $60. Great value, great food, great staff. A 10/10 experience all around."
"Great for a chain eatery, really good service and some great happy hour deals to be had.  Its in a great location for an early dinner, just off the casino."
"We can have 4 items off the Happy Hour Menu AND have 2 Sakes and get out of here for around $30! Where else can you do that? It's amazing!
And the fried banana ice cream dessert is to die for!"
"Wait time without reservation, but worth the wait.
Our server was informed that one in our party had a shellfish  allergy. He immediately gathered the restaurants info sheets and sat with us to go over every dish we wanted to order and assured us what choices were completely safe. They take allergies very seriously. Very valuable info.
The food was tremendous. Appetizer ribs WOW so fantastic and plentiful.  If you love veggies the small size plate of asparagus is delicious and plentiful for 2. The same for the small order of pea pods, taste and quantity great value. Will always return each LV visit"
"Too many kids running around screaming and no one controlling them - tepid food and boring predictable menu - one person at our table asked the Hispanic waiter if there was a real Chinese chef in the kitchen and he almost laughed in our faces as he answered ""NO"".   Won't return."
I Loved the flavor from the food! Everything was delicious ... Though it took a lot time to give us a table (for 10)  the letucce wraps are a great option also noodles with shirmp ... We order for food to the center and we shared to try everything... Average ticket 25 usd
For a quick respite &  a reasonably price lunch or dinner.
Chinese food doesn't get any better than this. The servers make sure everything is just the way you ordered it. The food is always prepared perfect.
There were 6 of us and we really enjoyed ordering a variety of food and sharing.  Our waiter was great!
"Sit at the bar if you can find a table... great people, staff and food."
"SIt on the 2 floor and try get a seat looking out at the Strip! Perfect way to enjoy the yummy lettuce wraps! Servers were very knowledgable about the dishes and made good suggestions for my picky friends. Servings are huge, so it's best to get dishes to share. It get busy fast so call ahead if you have a party larger than 4, or send someone up to save a table."
"This place has great tasting Chinese food.  Simply as that.  Yes, crowded and a bit on the noisy side but the server we had was great and the food very tasty."
"It's Vegas, and food is often chancy. This PF Chang was as good as any other PF Chang I've been to. If you like PF Chang, you should try this one. Be careful to avoid busy times, as seeting is limited."
"we ate here on the first night of our trip and on the last when we returned to Vegas.  Good food, good service but a little pricy."
"Well priced and their appetizers are amazing ! (beans and wontons were delish!!), Ginger mojito also amazing!"
"Went here based on recommendations from friends and all the reviews on Trip Advisor.  Maybe it was an off day or I expected too much?  Walked in and the placed smelled like old cooking oil and was a little smoky from the cooking fumes.  Overall service was good - drinks and appetizer came right away.  Lettuce wraps we ordered were not that great - I have had better.  They were supposed to be chicken lettuce wraps, but it was hard to tell, it looked like the chicken had been run through a blender and I honestly couldn’t taste the chicken.   Main courses we ordered Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken.  Both mains were okay but wayyyyyyyyyyyy too salty.    The beef came with a literal garden of green onions – not sure why – I would have thought maybe some green or orange peppers would have been better maybe added some colour.  Guess green onions are cheap.  Prices were reasonable but I would rather pay a little more for better quality.  The restaurant had a really crowed layout – you could share dishes with the people at the table next to you if you wanted !  This caused all the waiters to carry drinks and food above the patrons heads – I was just waiting for a shower of Pepsi or rice to land on my head.  Not a horrible experience but not what I expected - I don't think I'll return."
"I don't have to tell you about PF Chang's - they deserve their reputation as a fantastic place to eat!  This one is right off the floor of the Planet Hollywood Casino.  It's nice to be able to find a high quality restaurant just steps from your favorite slot machine or table game.  Eating on the Strip can be a 'dicey' experience, you find the place and the wait is over an hour or two.  The convenience of being right off the PH casino floor is fabulous, and you can gamble should you have to wait."
"This place is fantastic - the food was so good i am gutted they don't have one in the UK - and if i had the money would fly to Vegas just for this restaurant. 

There were about 10 of us so we all decided to get 10 dishes and share - i couldn't fault one dish each one was Delicious cooked perfectly 

The staff were brilliant - it was so busy at the restaurant but they were efficient, friendly, helpful i have nothing but praise for them just superb.

I cant wait to go back and eat more"
The problem here is the ice.  The iced tea was great but as the ice melted the flavor of the tea changed to terrible.  The food was good but the service made the experience pleasant.
"This PF Chang's is great! If you see that they are busy try asking if there is room at the bar upstairs.  There is a great bartender named Sebastian and he ROCKS. He makes really good cocktails, he fun to have serve you and he does a really excellent job! TIP SEBASTIAN WELL! He is really great!"
"My friend and I ate at PF Changs during our last visit to Planet Hollywood and had a really good experience.  We had a great waiter that recommended dishes to us.  We were seated right next to the window so we could look out at the strip.  The seafood dishes are always so tasty so if you want an inexpensive meal, I would definitely recommend coming to this restaurant."
"Every time I go to Vegas, I go to P.F. Chang's because it truly offers the very best Chinese Food I've ever had.  My favorite choices are the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Tempura Green Beans, Orange Chicken and Sweet and Sour Prawns.  The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent.  Great desserts too.  Highly recommend you get there early as there's always a line up .... for a reason!   It's super popular and worth the wait."
"We ate here 2 times in 4 days taking advantage of the Happy Hour from 3-6! Great food, great drinks, & excellent prices! The Flaming Red Wontons were sooooooooo good! Then again so were the lettuce wraps, Lemongrass chicken dumplings, crab wontons, edamame, & street tacos. Sat at the bar the 1st time, & outside on the patio on the strip the 2nd time. Sitting out on the patio, watching Vegas go by was definitely entertaining! I will without a doubt be back on a return trip to Vegas! We need a PF Changs in Victoria ASAP! Love this place!"
"Great choice for Chinese food while in Vegas! If you like Chinese you won't be disappointed here. It's crowded, like any good restaurant in Vegas, so book a rez or plan on hanging for a while at the bar. The bar's not real big, but adequate with several TV's to watch sports while you wait. It's also in a good area in terms of other attractions so convenient for before or after. 

The outdoor seating is right on the Strip, but didn't look too appealing to us. But check it out for yourself as it might be a good option. I'd also try to sit in the main floor dining room rather than upstairs if possible."
We ate here on a busy Wednesday night.  Even at 9:30 it was packed!  We had a friendly and efficient server and the food was the same great quality as other PF Chang locations.  We had Chang's Chicken and Wok Charred Beef.  Portions were generous and the food hit the spot.
Had a great meal here and service was wonderful too.
"Every dish at the table was well-prepared and tasty.  Some of the favorites were the lettuce wraps (appetizer), sesame chicken and shrimp with candied walnuts. The service was great; it took several minutes to get our drinks, but after that, things went smoothly.  There are some tables outside, so on nicer days/nights, consider sitting there.  (Just note that the birds like to hang out there, too.) The only minor, minor downside to this restaurant is that the bathroom is located out in the casino, so if you have a table at the far end of the restaurant, you have to walk all the way through the restaurant and out into the casino a few hundred feet to get to the bathroom."
"This restaurant was recommended to me, and I see why, very good quality food, but be prepared for the huge portions.  Book your table before you go, as the restaurant gets very busy, we wanted to go one night and they said it was a 45 minute to one hour wait, so we booked the table for the next day.  The service however wasn't the greatest, as we did hve to wait a while for the bill.  It's a good restaurant, reasonably priced, and worth a trip."
"We stayed in Vegas last month for 5 nights, we ate in P.F Chang's 3 times.

The food was outstanding but the service was the main feature. All the waiters were polite, friendly and helpful.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Great food and service!  Was able to make reservations and were seated promptly.  Food was great and our wait staff wonderful!
"We got there at 9.30pm and had to wait about 25 mins which is what they told us when we got there. Not ideal but got a stool at the bar for a drink so all was fine but space was a little limited. Cocktails were good and then when shown to a table all was fine except starter was a little slow and the 2 dishes turned up at different times. Does not sound great but the food was very good and not expensive. It was the best Chinese I've had for some time, well cooked and good flavours, hence the high score despite some waiting."
"Took a while to get drinks, apps. were great, dinner was great."
"Loved the lettuce wraps!  It gets very busy on the weekends, we ended up just eating at the bar instead of waiting over an hour for a table.  Just as good service, just a little loud though.  But, we still enjoyed the meal!"
"The service is fantastic, our server Thomas was great!  Helpfull with the menu and suggested excellent dishes.  The food was very good and really I can't say anything bad!  A must eat!"
Servers were great food was the best and ambiance was wonderful...ate outside and watched the people on the street...Went back for lunch the food was so good..and not pricey..
"Great food, Great service.  Arrived around 2:30 in afternoon and the place was still busy.  A little pricey but about on par for Las Vegas.  The Lettuce Wraps are a KEEPER and you can't go wrong with it, either as an appetizer or a main course."
"Food was good.  Very busy, crowded, and noisey.  The wait to be seated was longer than expected, but that is not unusual in a restaurant.  The service staff were polite and apologetic for the wait and for our patience.  We enjoyed our meal."
Cant go wrong at PFs.  Enjoyed watching the food prepared as we waited.
"I came on a Saturday night, had a long wait for a table but once we sat down service was good.  There is a Prix Fixed menu for 2 that had great selections for less than 50 dollars.

I had the orange beef, my friend had lemon chicken, both were very good and we took home enough for  another full lunch the next day out the microwave from at our hotel. They actually cook the food here opposed to reheating it like other restaurant chains.  Try the steamed dumplings, they were so good!"
"Visited here on our first night in Vegas after arriving quite late in the day.  It was convenient for the hotel and not too busy.  We waited about twenty minutes for a table and then got offered one in the ""bistro"" area, which was basically a back room beside the kitchen.  

We ordered vegetable spring rolls to share, a vegetable lo mein, and chicken in black bean sauce.  The vegetable rolls were completely inedible, very poor quality that I wouldn't feed to my dog.  We sent them straight back.  We should probably have left then and there but we were tired having been on the road all day and it was late.  

The mains were not much better than the starter.  My wife has a thing for lo mein, but this wasn't lo mein at all, it was just some thin generic noodles in a sauce that you could buy at any supermarket.  Not really any vegetables to speak of.   My chicken in black bean sauce was ok, but it was more like a sweet BBQ sauce than black bean.  Not sure that the chefs really know what they're doing.  Perhaps you can't get authentic ingredients in Las Vegas.

Quite disappointed we paid for the mains and got out of there.  Not recommended."
We arrived at 4:30pm for our 4:30 dinner.  We noticed no one outside and inquired about sitting outside.  They said the wait time was 45 min to an hour.  We chose to sit inside.  We ordered drinks and the drinks were mostly watered down.  More mix then alcohol.  When we inquired and ordered a shot of vodka and a glass of coke the shot glass came with half of the shot in the glass. We ended up talking to the manager and he took the shot off our bill but still very poor service.   We ordered lettuce wraps.  We have five people at the table and the lettuce came and there was two pieces of lettuce. The wraps were great tasting but having to ask for more lettuce three times was poor service.  We proceeded with dinner and watched outside.  Only a few couples were ever sitting out there.  I guess we did not tip enough for an outside table!  We ordered lots of great food and between the 5 of us ordered 5 dishes.   Great food but again the service was poor.  Having to wait for silverware and the waitress to order our food.  Lots of PF Chang one block off the strip.  Easier parking and you will have the same view of the inside of the restaurant either way.
"Food was tremendous, so much so we couldn't finish and given a take away:)"
"P.F. Chang's in Planet Hollywood is always a must when we visit Las Vegas and anyone we have taken there or recommended it to raves about it and then recommends it as well.  The food is always fresh, hot and so good.  The lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, orange chicken are just a few of our favorites.  We usually try a few new things every time we go, and have not been disappointed yet.  

Recommend calling ahead for a reservation or thru your hotel as it is ALWAYS extremely busy.  You can just go but you will more than likely have to wait 1/2 hr. to 1 hr. before getting in.  It is a noisy place but the food is always sooooo good.  The pricing is very reasonable as well and will run around $ 15 to $ 20 a person if you order a bunch of different dishes."
"This was our first visit to Las Vegas from England,where we were staying at Planet Hollywood for our wedding anniversary.We must be honest and say that we had never heard of PF Changs before but we love Chinese food and decided to take a look.We peered through the windows from the inside of the hotel and liked the look of it,although we saw that it was quite busy,with plenty of customers waiting for tables,so we decided to try at a later date.I went back the next day and reserved an upstairs window table for our anniversary on the Sunday night.We weren't disappointed,we had a table overlooking the strip with really pleasant surroundings.The excellent choice of menu was followed by impeccable service and quality of food and drink.The five spice duck from the new recipe was especially delicious and comes highly recommended.Can't speak highly enough of PF Changs and we returned to repeat the experience on the last night of our seven night stay."
One thing I have always expected from Las Vegas is great food and well above average service in Caesars/Harrahs properties.  The P.F. Changs really disappointed me.   The service was worse than anywhere I have been there.  Waiter did not ever serve the table and made multiple mistakes.   Management is not doing a very good job training their servers.  The food was not very good.  It was poorly prepared and served cool.   Asked for the lunch portion and recieved dinner portions at noon.  NOT IMPRESSED!!!!
We had apps and drinks at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and helpful.  Good job!
"Anyone who has eaten at a PF knows the quality. I like this venue because I'm usually solo, can sit at the bar, order the lettuce wrap appetizer (it's a full meal for one), a couple of draws, and get out of there (with tip) for less than $20."
"Around 7pm there is a 40 minute wait for this place. Even better head to 'Noodles' restaurant at the Bellagio, really good food!!"
Again really enjoyed our dinner here. Food is excellent and you really get good value for money compared with a lot of other Vegas restaurants. Alwasy busy at dinner time so we had to wait for 45 minutes or so but the food really is worth it. Will definitely go here again.
"Food was amazing, price was reasonable, service was quick, atmosphere was nice and overall we loved it and will go back! I would suggest making a reservation as wait time on a Fri night was an hour."
Loved the food. My wife fell in love this the lettuce rap. staff and servers very professional and friendly. A bit crowded for my taste. They have very narrow walk ways. But the food and service was well worth any hassles.
There's always a 15-30 minute wait at dinnertime.  Our food was overcooked and DH though hot and sour soup had too much cornstarch.  The lettuce wraps came with only 3 pieces of lettuce.
The food was delicious with massive portions. Reasonable prices in a good location. However the restaurant was way too busy and we where seated at the bar which was not ideal
"I just returned from vegas a few weeks back and had lunch here with my wife.  The restaurant is on the front side of planet hollywood and sits on the walkway for las vegas blvd.  I have not been to a pf changs in a few years and have to say I look forward to going back soon.  I am not usually a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I feel this company still maintains pride of serving good quality food for fair prices.  The quality of the food and the variety of choices on the menu were great.  The service staff could not have been better and I like the decor of the place itself, you really feel the theme.  I would highly recommend eating here if you are at planet hollywood and are hungry for some great chines food."
"And if you go by the happu hour is better, you can expext the same great taste as of other of changs restaurants"
Great experience in Vegas!  We have eaten at other PF locations and this was just as good!  Great wait staff and service!  Food was fast and delicious!
"This was my first time in PF Changs and I really enjoyed the experience.  My husband had been before and said we had to sit at the bar.  I was a bit dubious but I was glad that we did.  Instant service - able to watch what was going on and interact with the bar staff.  Food was delicious, I would describe it as modern fusion chinese and lots of options I would love to have tried.  Try a couple of appetisers and share them and see where you go from there.  An added bonus was that we got a free signature dish off the bill as this was my first visit which was a nice surprise.  Just wish they had more outlets outside USA."
Since first having eaten in a P F Chang's some 6-7 years ago we just can't get enough. Over the years the menu hasn't changed that much which suits us just fine. We love the food and the high energy atmosphere and have eaten in a dozen different Chang's. The service has always been great and the food always consistently delicious. Good functional wine list also. This was the third or fourth time we've eaten in the Planet Hollywood Chang's and we'll be back. Now would you guys please open up in our hometown (please!!!)
"We go to P. F. Chang's in every city we can, and never go wrong with the food.  Service is another matter, but they always try hard to remedy the problem."
I've been to P.F. Chang's for the past two years and they are simply one of the best Chinese Restaurants period.  The portions are very generous so please order wisely or be prepared for take home.  I tried the Lettuce Wraps this time and went back twice.  You must go if you love Chinese food.
"Great food, great drinks and great service makes this a restaurant you don't want to miss while you're in Las Vegas."
try happy hour 3-6 great meal for the pirce and great location
"Like all PF Changs, it's fabulous.  Went with a group this time and had great service and everything was delicious."
"Awesome food, Loud dining room due to open kitchen."
"I love PF Changs, and this one was good!  The only complaint was that we had to wait 20 min just to get a pager!  Then another 30, but overall good place to eat if you are not in a hurry!"
"I was introduced to PF Changs in Chicago and this branch in Las Vegas certainly did not dissapoint.  It was the same type of upbeat staff, who knew the menu very well.  A dietry variation from the menu was accommodated with a smile.  The food was of a very high standard, and the whole dining experience devine.  Because it was my wife's first time at PF's we got one of our starters free.  Do try the lettuce wraps, one of their signature dishes."
"Like I said, I'd never been to this restaurant before, so we gave it a try.. it was a warmish day so we sat on the patio.

The service was good, though our appetizers took far too long to arrive due to a shift change (according to our server) who was apologetic. She could have comped us for something... I would have, but thats just me I guess.

We had two dishes, that were both excellent, and it was way too much for us to eat at one sitting, They were happy to pack it up for us to take back to the hotel (made a great lunch the next day).

Overall, great food and reasonably priced for Vegas. I'd go back, but make sure you're not there around shift change time (I wish I could remember what time it was... I was in Vegas afterall!)"
"The food, as always, was amazing. I love the gluten free menu and could eat there everyday if it was not so pricey. 

Our waitress started out great but she soon disappeared and once we ordered we didn't see her again until we were ready to leave. We did a lot of waiting. After ordering the food took quite a while to come out - 35 minutes. Then we waited another 30 minutes after finishing to get our bill. The waitress never told us she was going on break if that is what happened. 

I love the food and the GF menu so I will always come back."
Must sit at the 2nd floor for the view of the Cosmopolitan. Food is as usual great.
"Visited PF Changs @ Planet Hollywood in Vegas for happy hour and ended up staying for dinner and back again for happy hour the next day as well. It was just that good. Prices for happy hour drinks and bites are really cheap. For dinner we did the ""2 for 45"" and were so stuffed and had tons of leftovers also. The food was so tasty especially the dumplings and the dynamite shrimp (spicy but oh so good)."
"Overly crowded and a long wait, but the food we orderded was well worth it!!"
Lined up like crazy so get there early in line and you get a transmitter to walk around casino ... for some reason there was a huge lineup but no one outside on the patio to eat so always ask for the patio ... we're back again in the fall same casino so this will be our 4th stay
"Buttermilk Onion rings over cooked, Ipswich clams frozen overcooked clam strips, Southern fried chicken fingers just frozen chicken fingers"
"Waiter seemed a bit juvenile. He rolled his eyes when he brought the wrong drink, but maybe it was not directed at us but more at himself. The food was good. It is a loud environment. Don't go here for a quiet dinner."
"This restaurant has a menu where the plates are designed for sharing and believe me there is enough to share. I love this style of eating as you get to try different things.
The food was fresh tasting unlike some of the other chinese i had tasted in Vegas.
The staff were friendly and helpful.
The only downfall was if you go after 7pm expect to wait. But i suppose this just shows you how good of a restaurant it is. 
We had no complaints and a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience here."
"Another great experience at PFC.  
Great service,
Great food.
PERFECT.
Orange Peel Chicken... wow!"
"Everything about PF Chang is calming, exotic and delicious :)   From the decor, to the ambiance to the food to the service staff.

Loved everything I ate there. Particularly the Hot & Sour Soup was oh so good! The kung pow chicken with lotsa dried chilis was fabulous.

They have a very good menu that will satisfy your love for Chinese food.

We ate there almost every day for lunch ;) 

Will definitely go back when I'm there next."
"This P.F. Chang's is a bit smaller than many of their other locations so you had better make a reservation.  Have a pen ready since they give you a confirmation code.  The food here is one of the better Chang's around.  They must have an extra special chef or something.  Everyone starts with the lettuce wraps which are an unusual appetizer but very tasty.  The honey crispy shrimp is excellent, as is the beef with broccoli.  Enjoy!"
"We had to wait for a table for about 20 mins but we sat at the bar and had a beer so it was very pleasant. Service was good, food was great.  I was full and found it hard to walk back to the room!  Will go again for sure."
"The first thing we do after booking out trip to Vegas is book a reservation online for this restaurant.  This place is usually lined up because it is so popular.  Hearty portions, great drinks and apps. You must try the lettuce wraps."
"Went here for lunch on our last day on The Strip. Liked the family style dining. Didn't order the Prix Fixe menu because we couldn't eat some of the food as I am allergic to seafood. We just ordered two dishes and an appy. To start we ordered Pork Dumplings which were delicious. For our main course we just split two dishes, beef and broccoli, and chicken lo mein. The beef and broccoli was good except that I think the broccoli was a little undercooked and didn't seem to hold much of the sauce, the beef was kind of crunchy on the outside, but I liked the added texture. The Chicken Lo Mein was good, but not the best I've ever had. The highlight of the meal was our server, Ricky. He was very attentive to our needs, and explained the concept of the menu well and made recommendations. Note: They give each person a small bowl of rice (not sure if it came with the B&B or what, but we each could choose between white or brown rice)."
"P F Changs has become one of my very favorite restaurants.  I search for one in any city I visit.   I have been known to drive a long distance to eat at one.  Why??   It has the ultimate gluten free menu.  Delicious food, great choices, no worry.   I can relax and just savour the food:)   They even use separate logo plates for gluten free so you instantly know which dishes are GF.   The egg drop soup is yummy.  My favorites are moo goo gai pan ( not sure of the spelling), Chang chicken, chicken and broccoli.  The chocolate mouse is decadently delicious.  Hard to believe it is gluten free ...  But it is:)  I would love to have the recipe:)  

I went for dinner last night and I'm going again for the lunch time special today.   My dearest wish is that they open one in Vancouver.  Build it and I will come:)"
Late night dinner after being in the sports book for 15 hours.  Tasted decent for 10:00 pm.
The food and service is really good.  Well worth a stop during your stay in Vegas.
Yummy! Loove the lettuce wraps!  Great service.  Hopping place!
Must try it...food and atmosphere live up to all that you here of any P.F. Chang's.
"I have read quite mixed reviews on Trip Advisor about this restaurant.  Visited here again 2 days ago and found the food to be amazing (as usual)  The prices are higher than some PF Changs (because it's Vegas) but as the portion sizes are so large we ordered  2 starters, one main and two rice (which was more than enough for 2)  The waiter was helpful and pleasant.  The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is no surprise as it holds hundreds of people but the constant buzz adds to the atmosphere in my opinion. There is  an option to sit outside under heated lamps although it wouldn' be any quieter outside as it is on a busy thoroughfare.  I have never been disappointed with this restaurant"
Wonderful dining experience and staff very friendly
Great service and food. Sat upstairs which is away from casino hustle&bustle
p.f. chang is my favorite restaurant. the planet hollywood las vegas location is great. right inside of my favorite hotel to stay at while in vegas. the food and serve are both excellent. the lettuce wrap and kao pow shrimp are a must to try.
"The food was okay...same as other PF Changs and the wait staff was pretty good, but very busy, it's just everything was so dirty and there was some yahoo standing there smoking a big, old cigar right while we were trying to eat! There should be some rules about allowing others to try to enjoy their meals without smelling and breathing in that crap!
They need to cleanitup a bit!"
Food was good and they were able to accommodate a large group with a relatively short wait. Service was also good.
"We were in Vegas 6 days and went to PF Changs twice.  Lettuce wraps are soooo good, and we did lunch and supper there.  Definitely always first on our list of restaurants to hit upon our arrival, we will be back!!  You have to try the salt and pepper shrimp too...no more expensive than any other restaurant in Vegas & the beer is cheap!"
The food was phenomenal & our waiter was a blast.  Would definitely eat here again.  Do get reservations if you are going for dinner!
"Lettuce wraps to die for. Great for the price. Too crowded, 45 min wait."
"we had dinner here and were seated upstairs. The service of our waiter was the best we experienced during our whole time in the U.S. He mixed us a special mild dipping sauce which was delicious. He was very friendly and polite. The meals didn't take long to come out. we had a budweiser $3.50, a glass of wine $5.00, an entree of salt and pepper calamari, $8.45. A mongolian beef dish $16.75 and a fried rice which was a very large serve for $11.95. The full price was $49.35 and we added a tip for the waiter who well deserved it.
The next day we decided to go back, sit outdoors and have lunch here. The lunch service was just as good, quick service and reasonably priced. This was one of the best restaurants we went to during our holiday."
Even though I am giving this an average rating it was overall a great experience with the staff who were extremely helpful. However throughout our group many mentioned that the portions were small for the price and myself and my wife were both left feeling we didn't quite get value for the expense of the meal.
"Can't say enough about the great service we received during our late lunch in Vegas last week...  I don't normally review chains, but they knocked it out of the park.  Incredible value...  all 5 of our appetizers were served fresh and fast.  Will do again... as it's hard to find a deal sometimes on the main strip... this is a hidden gem for sure."
We love PF Changs and eat there frequently (in all cities) but this is one of our favorites!
They have good variety of  the Chinese dishes to choose from and tastes good too.
"good food, service and relaxing. nice stop during a busy day"
"We went in for a bite before we went to see O... Had a quick meal, but food was delicious as always. To save time we sat at the bar on the second level - was cozy and quiet - bartenders were very nice and helpful. We ordered  the Crab wontons and Chicken Lettuce Wraps to start, and followed up with the Beef w/ Broccolli and Crispy Honey Chicken for entrees. there were 4 of us sharing as we just wanted a lighter meal, and this was more than enough to satisfy. Upon bringing our entrees the bartender also presented us with an order of Lo Mein, as he felt that we waited to long for our meal to come out ( i think perhaps there was a mix up with one of our dishes going to the wrong table). We thought this was a very nice gesture, especially since we didn't even mention the slightly longer wait. Overall, we had a great meal!"
It's the best chinese food around. I never get sick or headaches.
"We went here for our 7th anniversary dinner. They had an awesome prix fix menu that included soup, appetizer, main course and dessert for only $44.95. What a deal for two people. The service was fine, even though it was packed. We were able to get a table on the heated patio immediately with our reservations. Great place to go for good food."
Have been here twice and both times it was a memorable experience! Really great food and the server was lots of fun. Pretty good value and a great place for sharing.
"We sat at the bar during happy hour and tried 4 dishes off the menu, all great, but the chicken lettuce wraps were the stand out. Pear mojitos were great too. Excellent value."
Standard PF Chang fare - nothing special - good service
"I was there with a foot injury and had a visible boot and cane. They gave us a table on the 2nd floor and did not offer an elevator option, just a giant staircase. this was painful, inconvenient and embarrassing."
"This is the best restaurant in Planet Hollywood. I have dined at many of PF Changs, but this one may be the best.  You can't go wrong with Chang's spicy Chicken."
It was very nice to see this kind of food that we can get back home.
"We had the $49 set menu for two and there was more than enough food to fill us up. The food was of a very high standard, particulalry the prawns and both soups. The service was very friendly and efficient. Please remember to order tap water and not bottled water. This was our rookie mistake because we were jet lagged from an 11 hours flight and eating at 04:00 GMT on our first night. Thoroughly recommended restaurant."
"Love this place. It’s one of my favorite restaurants.  Try Changs spare Ribs, there the best!"
"We dined here for a late afternoon lunch about 3 in the afternnoon after walking the strip for hours and not wanting to eat fast food.  There was no wait although the restaurant looked very busy.  We sat on the second floor so we had a little bit of view of the casinos across the street and the constant flow of people walking on the strip below us.  We ordered a meal for two which I think cost around $45 and included soup, choice of an appetizer, choice of two entrees, and choice of two desserts.  This was very reasonable and was more than enough food for both of us.  The food was good and typical of other PF Changs we have visited.  I recommend the lettuce wraps."
"This place is always a must for us when we're in Vegas.  We don't have a PF Chang's in our hometown, the closest one is about two hours away, so it's always a treat when we get to eat here.  

We go at lunch, because it gets crowded at dinner time.  We always ask to be seated by the windows, so we can do some Strip watching.  

We have never had bad service at THIS particular PF Changs, but have had mediocre service at other locations.  
The beef lo mein is fabulous, but the cashew almond chicken is my favorite.  The eggrolls are the best, and we like to mix the sauces they put on the tables.

They do take-out, too, so if you're staying in the hotel, or just headed out of the casino, you can pick up your order at the takeout window just inside the door, and take it with you.

Our usual spend is $25-$35, and that's for two entre's, eggrolls, and beverage."
P.F. Chang's never disappoints.  The noodles are always spiced to perfection and the spicy duck was one of the best Chinese dishes I have ever had.  Wash it down with a Kirin ir two and you are laughing.  Try and sit upstairs by the windows to overlook the strip.
"OK, I'm Chinese, they're food is not. I totally understand
americanizing chinese food here in the US. However,
P.F. Chang's is like a glorified Panda Express. Totally,
over priced non eventful entrees and appetizers. Noisy,
hectic atmosphere coupled with slow waiters made
for one lousy experience."
"We took customers to this place. Other than the food, everything was terrible. We had an issue and the manager really didn't care. Doesn't have a clue about customer service. If your drunk and need something to eat, maybe stop in and you wont notice the difference. Otherwise, go somewhere else."
"I love their spicy green beans.  (not the breaded ones, but the regular green beans).  Yummy!"
"We were recently in Las Vegas entertaining customers for a couple of days.  My husband and I recommended PF Changs for our wind up supper as we had eaten there many times before and had a great experience.  We arrived at 1:30 to check on our reservation for 3pm only to find the reservation was not in their system.  We were able to make another reservation and returned at 3:30.
After a 10 minute wait, we were sat in a quiet room closed off from the noise of the restaurant, which we very much appreciated.
The waiter recommended a special menu they had for large parties that came with priority placement in the kitchen.  Sounded great to us as we had to catch a plane.  One of our guests had allergies and was given a special menu to accommodate her needs.  All was great to this point! Our meal started to be served one dish at a time and we were told our guest with the special order would have her meal shortly.  We were half way through our meal before she was served.  Finally her meal came and we all continued eating.  

After a few minutes, the waiter came running to our table, took her meal away and said, ""you haven't eaten any of that, have you?"" You can imagine our reaction when we were told she was served the wrong dish.  Not only was our guest exposed to peanut oil, she was now without food AGAIN! Everything went downhill from there.  The manager was made aware of the situation and offered DESSERT as compensation.  He assured everyone he was very sorry for the mixup and delays!!!!!  

WELL...........the dessert was so slow coming out that we had to take it to go as we were about to miss  our plane.  To make matters worse, we waited at least 20 minutes to get our bill and literally ran out of the restaurant to catch our plane.    The experience was a terrible way to wind up a great vacation to Vegas!  I'm sure our guests will never returned to PF Changs, Planet Hollywood!"
"Food was just ok.some dishes were good and some not so good
Portions were smaller then expected.Ordered 6 dishes for a party of 5 could have used more.
Would not go again"
"This is the best PF Changs I have been to. The food was always top notch, the wait staff was great and the drinks were perfect. Even when it was packed, everything was still better than expected"
"Good value, and great food, but a long wait.   Get reservations before heading over."
"I've been to this P.F. Chang's 4 times now, and it has never been a disappointment. Order anything off the menu, and you will love it. The atmosphere is lovely, especially on the second floor with windows overlooking the strip, the food is superb and the staff are friendly and helpful. 

It can get busy, so make reservations!"
The food was awesome!! The service was fast and courteous.
"Anytime I'm in a city that has a PF Chang, we go.  Best lettuce wraps ever.  Food is such good quality."
"Good selection, and good prices. Very busy both nights we were there, a good sign. Recommended."
"My birthday present was dinner at P F Changs.It just happened to  be in Las vegas.That was a nice bonus.I had waited years to  eat there..My husband has been to  P F changs in Fort Lauderdale and always boasts about how wonderful it was and how it was the best chinese food he has ever had..This is a huge compliment coming from him.He was not wrong.The server was excellent.Helping us with choices, offering to  wrap our moo goo gai pork, talking with us.Not once making us feel like he was too  busy to  serve us and the restaurant was full.Our lettuce wraps and sweet and sour chicken were the very best ever.We had way too  many dishes.But we were not disappointed.Cant wait to  go again.I would definatly do  this with a group and make reservations!"
Always like PF Chang's!  Their green beans are to die for! The atmosphere is nice and it is quiet and not noisey. The restaurants are always clean. The food great! We always find a PF Chang's!
nice restaurant we had a window view at night saw all the action on the strip food was fantastic
eh....just ok....it was a little crowded and not as clean as it should be. Benn to P.F. Changs in NY and Florida and this is not the best one
Very good food at a very affordable price. We eat here every time we're in Las Vegas. Try it and love it.
"Very good service, the food was good and the Tsingtao beer cold."
I stopped in to visit friends and they never asked me if I needed anything to drink/eat. Wow!
"very busy but a good quality eatery, noise a bit much but that happens when it's so busy. Lots of food!"
Had a great meal here.  My wife is on a gluten free diet and this place had a whole page of menu items.  Service was excellent and the food was delicious.  Highly recommended.
service was good but the food had very little taste.
Expensive and lacked flavour.Over $30.00 for some plain noodles and some very boring squid with chilli. Better in my local chinese.
"I've been to P.F. Changs a few times.  The one in Vegas was no different.  It was good food, nice atmosphere, and we sat upstairs. It was very busy, but we still got our food in a timely fashion."
"Food was good as expected and staff was courteous and professional. We ate here twice in the same week. Avoid the casino though. Too many people, too many drunks, and too wild for our taste."
"I should point out that this was not the Chang's branch I had originally planned on. The one I wanted was closed on Christmas day, so this was second choice.
1st impressions were good. As I had made an appointment, we got straight to our table.
Service was excellent, considering how busy it was, but unfortunately the food let it all go downhill. My wife was very happy with her choice, but as usual, I picked a wrong 'un
I ordered eggfried rice with chicken and shrimp. Bi bowl of rice arrived and it was actually quite good. Not greasy. Er...where's the chicken?...oh! there's a bit!...wait for it....yes, another bit!  Now. The shrimp. In we go....nope, still llooking..stil...oh, you get the picture.
I thought about mentioning it to the waiter, but as the place was so busy, i didn't want to wait ages for a fresh lot.
I did mention it to the waiter at the ned of the meal, hoping for some discount perchance?
Nochance
Oh well, there were better meals in our week in Vegas"
"The beer prices are great for being on the strip, food is good too. We were starving and trying to avoid the crowds, so we stopped in and found 4 seats at the bar--despite a 30 minute wait for tables--and ate and drank ourselves silly for less than a buffet at the casino. And no wait! $4 beers--and that's not even happy hour!"
Good food at reasonable prices. Service could have been a little better.
"We enjoyed the spiced limb and lettuce wraps. We love their dishes and drink, and were pleased with the service."
Easy place to get in but the service is very poor so be prepared to wait.
"We chose P.F. Chang's for our 35th anniversary dinner. The staff took us upstairs -- way into the back so we could enjoy a quiet dinner. Our waiter (Dave) was excellent and we enjoyed his wit and attention.

To start the meal, we ordered  the BUDDHA'S FEAST vegetable plate w/brown rice (stir fried). One order was just the perfect size to split. The flavor was just right and the veggies were fresh and crisp.

Main course- I choose ASIAN GRILLED NORWEGIAN SALMON and the wife ordered the NORWEGIAN SALMON STEAMED WITH GINGER. Both were cooked perfectly. The orations were larger than expected.

We topped it off with a NEW YORK-STYLE CHEESECAKE (as usual, we split), and the experience was almost perfect.

We have never had a bad meal at PF Chang's and suggest you try it."
"service good, great drinks and good low cal options."
We always visit this restaurant for lunch when in Vegas. Food is varied and always good. Reasonable prices for the quality. Can be crowded on weekends. We had a 20 min. wait on a Saturday.
"If you're staying at Planet Hollywood or even on the strip looking for a quality bite to eat PF Changs is a great stop.  They have to go service which is great if you want to take your food back up to the room.  I recommend the lunch menu, which provides a good amount of food at a reasonable price.  I had the crispy honey chicken and it was just awesome.  The service inside the restaurant is just as good as the prices and food quality."
"I had dinner with my friends, it was Halloween night, It seemed busy in there and was told about 30min wait, but we were seated in 15min or so. Food came out fast, it was good,
Nothing special, but good food and good size. 
Wish they have more vegetarian/vegan options =)"
I liked being able to have a more intimate dining experience by going upstairs.  The food is good and affordable.
"I had the sampler menu with my wife.  Perfect sized portions for us and very tasty.  It's not fine dining, but it was very good and very reasonably priced.  I'd go again."
"Dont get a dish each - share! Chinese is traditionally more expensive but this was great value for money and the amount you get exceeds even the usual massive american portions.
Staff very nice, friendly & open to suggestions. Definately go back"
Was here for a business trip and we arrived at the hotel in time for happy hour- we ate like kings for pennies due to the 1/2 price appetizers and drinks....it filled us up- the atmosphere was great and people were very friendly
"We didn't made a reservation and we had too wait for a long time, but we got the opportunity too sit at the bar. Cause we were so hungry we did and it was great. Because we are tourist from Holland you can see and hear more from other people, so it was no problem. And the food!! It was really tasty!! And the price was good."
Always find the food at Pf Chang's to be excellent.  The portions are good- sized and the service is above average.  Price is reasonable.
"Service was good but the food was very saltly and tasted like in was packaged food. If eaten at other PF Changs before and it was yummy, here not so much Sorry..."
we tried out their signature chicken dish with lettuce leaves and were not disappointed. The rest of the stuff was good but the chicken as definitely 4 star
Chicken letuce wraps followed by Mongolian beef.  Fantastic!
"Service was outstanding, food was great and the price was reasonnable
He had a great meal !!!

enjoy"
"The food was excellent, the service could be better the waiters could give you more advice on the menu...ahh they only have Fiji bottled water $$$$$$.. rather have a house wine"
We visit PF Changs everytime we are in Vegas (or other locations when in California as well).  Food is always fantastic.  Price is great.  We usually dine with at least 4 or more people so we can order a variety of dishes to share.  Everything we have tried has been fantastic but the Won Ton Soup is delicious (big portion).  Note:  Steamed white or brown rice is included so no need to order another rice dish.  This location excepts reservations by phone or on-line so you can book in advance which is wonderful with a large party or just a couple hours notice when you know you'll be ready to dine.  Looking forward to dining there again at Christmas!
"This place does really good food and the portions are enormous!!  My wife and I had an appetizer each and this could have comfortably qualified as a entree!

Ate so much we couldn't manage a dessert which was equally disappointing when we spotted the giant piece of cake the people at the table next to us had.

Highly recommend this restaurant but make sure you make a reservation (especially if you want to sit on the terrace) as it gets really busy!"
"I was so excited to go to PF Changs. the food was good but it was expensive and small portions. I get that it is chinese food and they do not eat the disgusting amounts of food per sitting as I do, but I was hungry. the atmosphere is very nice and inviting. But the cheque was too big!"
"Was travelling solo this day and decided to try PF Changs at Planet Hollywood. Asked for a seat outside even though a tad bit chilly but they had outdoor heaters. Orderd the Moo Shu Gai Pan off the lunch menu with a pot of herbal tea. It was good - typical chicken and veggie with a thick sauce dish served over rice. Overall it was good, but it was fun to people watch as I ate my lunch. The overall price was $20 including tip so I was happy for the value I received and would eat there again. Lots of little birds around trying to eat the crumbs so I crushed up my fortune cookie and threw some crumbs on the ground for them :-)"
Food is excellent asian fusion style.  Pricing is very reasonable.  The group book person is very disorganized though.
"This restaurant has such a wide selection of food to choose from, there is something for everyone!"
Very busy restaurant and good prices but the food is very average. Service was excellent.
Always a good meal no matter where I go. The service is always good and the meal size is not too big and not too small. The price is what I would expect.
Allowed us to sit at the bar rather than waiting 1.5 hours for a table - quick service and great food!
My wife and I went out for our last night in Vegas and chose to go to PF Chang's for dinner.  We arrived at 9:00 on a Tuesday and the place was almost full.  I felt that the staff was attentive and interested in making our night a pleasurable one.  We had separate appetizers and shared an entree.  The quantity of food made us glad we didn't order separately.  I've eaten at other PF Chang's and this held up to it's reputation.
"Waited for an hour and a half. When i went and harassed them for the 5th time they seated us at a table that had been empty for 20 mins, pointlessly frustrating, and for that reason i'd never return.
The food however was very good, reasonably priced and drinks were cheap for Vegas. Waiter was pretty friendly and explained everything very well"
"We love the food at PF Chang's, especially the chicken lettuce wrap and the mongolian beef. We were five so we got to try new dishes because we eat family style.

What was so suprising is the service was fantasic. I was griping all the way as we walked about the last time I was in Vegas how slow the service was at every restaurant we went to, 10 in total. I began to think it was just the mentality of the town. This trip proved me wrong.

The only thing I was disappointed about it I forgot my PF Chang warrior card and they couldn't look it up to get the 10% discount. I was very relieved the service was excellent so I can overlook thier reward system not being as easy to use as I'd like."
"Ate here several years ago on a trip to Vegas and had a great meal.  Six years later, the food is just as good and the service as well.  We did make reservations and waited less than five minutes once we got there. The four of us shared several dishes including the Singapore Street Noodles, coconut curry vegetables and wok-charred beef.  All were delicious!!  My only complaint would be that the tables should be bigger to fit more dishes!  It is a moderately priced restaurant.  Approximately $100 for the four of us with wine is a great deal in a town like Vegas.  Yes it`s loud and a little crowded but again, it`s Vegas!"
"we visit pf chang's every time we visit vegas.  try going for happy hour, they have some good bites at a great price.  the size is the same as the regular menu price.  it can be a bit noisey when crowded.  the portions are good sized also"
"We reserved one of the patio tables which give a great view of the ""Strip"" including the Bellagio fountains.
O.K. we had to wait 30 minutes past our booked time but they were very busy and we enjoyed a drink at the bar whilst waiting.
Once seated outside the service and food were great.
The Jasmine at the Bellagio is three times more expensive and the food and service are both inferior.
Very reasonably priced and great location."
"The food here is amazing, especially the chicken lettuce cups. It is a little expensive, but worth it to get some delicious, fresh food. Check out the happy hour specials for some great deals on food and drink."
"We had a reservation for dinner - when we arrived, we still had to wait almost 30 minutes.  The place was jammed, there's nowhere to stand to be out of the way.  We finally stepped outside the restaurant to sit on the benches along the outside wall - much better.  Server was wonderful - he knew we had limited time before a show and got us out in ample time.  They even brought us an extra dish to try because we had to wait!"
"Great cocktail bar, busy, noisy and exciting venue.  Interesting architecture, staff automatically provide chop-sticks and silverware.  Nothing on the menu to frighten first timers but the food we ate was freshly cooked and well flavored."
"We ate twice at PF Chang's at the Planet Hollywood Casino at the request of my husband.

The wait: The restaurant is on the Strip, so expect to wait for a table during dinner (between 6pm and 9pm). They provide pagers and people are encouraged to spend time in the casino. Our wait on a Saturday night at around 7pm was about 1-hour; we had no wait for a table on a Monday at 6pm.

The restaurant: This restaurant is the same as other PF Chang's -- dark woods, mood lighting and a busy bar. It was loud, but it doesn't interfere with having a conversation with companions.

The food: The food, while tasty, is almost exclusively deep fried. The filling for the lettuce wraps, the orange peel chicken, the sweet and sour pork all seemed (or were) to have a coating and were deep fried. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty (thanks to the sauces), but it would've been nice to have something...fresh.

The service: The service was great. Our servers were not only friendly, but seemed to come around our table when we needed them -- we didn't have to flag anyone down.

Overall: It's pricy for what you really get. I'd stick to a traditional Chinese take out."
"Dined at the bar alone and found it to be just ok.  The food was good, not great.  The service was ok.  I actually found that it appeared that they did not pay as much attention to me because I was alone.  I found that a little strange since typically bartenders are very good about engaging a single diner since they are alone.  It was good, just not great."
"The chicken and lettuce wraps were awesome - well worth a try.

Had to book a table as too busy the previous evening (totally don't understand why as it wasn't that good). 2 servers were clearly having an argument on the table next to us which was pretty uncomfortable."
We eat here all the time. Can get pretty busy and wait times vary.Food is always great and service as well. This is also convenient when you are staying at Planet Hollywood.
Just wanted a quick place to stop and grab something fast to eat but still with the Las Vegas environment.  We asked to be seated outside which was no problem.  Ordered the Sesame Chicken Entree.  It was done perfect.  Small portion.  Service was good.
There was absolutely no fat on any of the meat which was awesome!  The flavour was incredible!  Try the Kung Pai Shrimp - to die for!
"We were seated upstairs and went for dinner.  The restauarant has a lovely atmosphere and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Huge portions of food, but good quality, their sauce they make up at the table is gorgeous.  Don't think I will ever have a chinese again like it!"
"Everyone should try P.F Chang's once in their life.  The lettuce wraps are to die for.  The service was very good.  The only downside of this location is that it is so packed in there.  With four people at our table, it was a bit crowded as there are so many different plates for each order.  Other than that, it was wonderful!"
"At the PF Chang's in our town, the offer a dessert dish if someone in your party is celebrating a birthday.

Apparently that is not the case at the LV location.  We mentioned this to our waitress and she just gave us an odd look.  The she ran back to the other group of waiters/waitresses that were standing around and let out a big laugh.

We ordered the dumplings, which were the highlight of our meal.    Everything else was swimming in soy sauce or tasteless.

So if you want to be served salty dishes served by saucy waitstaff, this is your place."
"I loved the food, our waiter was a little rude but I overlooked that."
"I have been to PF Chang's in Florida many times.  I have to say that our visit to the Las Vegas location was a huge disappointment.  This isn't fine dining by any stretch, however, the food is usually pretty decent.  What we encountered was mediocre, everything was just okay.  The lettuce wraps were good, but the honey chicken and sweet and sour soup were horrible.  Had we not been under time constraints to get to a show, we would have sent the food back ( which I have never done before).  And the service could have been a lot better."
Good quality chinese at an affordable price.....good service good atmosphere
"This is the place to go on the Strip for fresh Chinese cuisine, in a great restaurant atmosphere.  Our server (Penny) was exceptional, and because we were seated before 6pm (just) we received our first round of drinks at happy hour prices.  A must see at the South end of the Strip."
"P.F. Chang's is a good play for Chinese food in Las Vegas. The resturant is located at The Planet Hollywood Casino, accross the street from Cosmopolitan. If you are looking for a great view with your meal, and don't want to spend the ""big bucks"", then this is the place. 

There is seating upstairs on the second level which overlooks the Vegas Strip. The view is especially good at night time. But be forewarned. The food is cooked downstairs and then brought upstairs. Service can be a little spotty during the dinner rush, and food luke warm. 

The resturant is open late, until midnight Sunday thru Thursday, and to 1:00 am Friday & Saturday. It does get crowded during dinner hours so you might want to make a reservation. They do provide beepers, so if you don't have a reservation and have to wait, you can always try your luck at the slot machines just a few feet away."
"First went to PF Changs in Newport Beach some time ago..... Vegas did not disappoint . Lettuce wraps were amazing the beef so tender and the portions huge! So you have been warned , good service and not too over attentive"
This is our second time there and I have to admit that the first time was waaaay better than the second. We made reservations which they lost but still were able to get in within 15 minutes  We waited quite a long time to get drinks and the restaurant was very loud making it difficult to converse. The food was pretty good but nothing to rave about. Our waitress was good but she seemed very automated.....kinda fake in a creepy way.  Lol. Might give them a third try but won't make a huge effort next time in Vegas.
"The restaurant is well located in front of Bellagio. We had chance to eat upstairs. So we could see the fountains of Bellagio.
The staff is really firendly and really professional. Without booking we had not to wait for long.
Food is really fresh and really good. Of course, this is Vegas Price but despite, prices are really corrects.
The wine list is also really good.

second time there and still pleased."
"Had a reasonable meal, late one night. Would not make an effort to go again. It was good, solid chinease fare, but there is better food for the price in Vegas"
"Last weekend I ate at P.F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. This is the second time I have eaten there. The service is excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and advised us before our order was complete that the portions were very large. I really appreciated that because, unlike at home, what do you do with leftovers in a hotel?
We ordered several appitizers (since it was happy hour, they were at a discount.) The green beans were wonderful as were the spring rolls. We ordered several main dishes and shared. I love the Mongolian Beef! As a surprise we were given an extra dish, chicken and cashews. 
Everything was freshly made and delicious! This is a restaurant I would definitely return to"
"I went to Vegas for an educational course, so I wasn't looking for the club scene.  I was looking for good quality food, good service, and a short wait.  PF Changs is a favorite back home, so I gave it  try.  I had a very short wait, although since it was next to the ""Pleasure Pit"" at Planet Hollywood [negligee-clan dealers, with a couple dancing above the tables], the wait was certainly tolerable.

Service was very good, and the food was the standard PFChange fare, which is always good.  Although I was running solo, there were a lot of couples that seemed to enjoy NOT having all the fuss of a restaurant like Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville.  Maybe Margaritaville would be fun if you had enough margaritas.  I just wanted a very good meal w/o a lot of fuss."
"This was a typical high-quality food PF Changs -- however, the restaurant had particularly cool decor -- and it was crowded with a wait every time we tried to go.  Finally waited one night, and it was worth it.  Very cool place to eat once -- especially if you are unfamiliar with PF Changs or a fan of it."
"We stayed at PH and visited PF Changs on our first night in Vegas. Excellent service, good choice of drinks and it's so difficult to choose the food! We went with Mongolian beef and chow mein, 
Only issue is it's a big walk to the toilets as they are out of the restaurant in the casino! 
Food was so great, we decided to return towards the end of our stay. We were not disappointed with our return visit. Best chinese in Vegas!"
Love this restaurant!!! Food was amazing and staff were great!!! Highly recommend checking it out!
I am gluten free/celiac disease and they have a great menu for people with dietary challenges and the food was GREAT!  I highly recommend this restaurant!!!  I can't say enough good about this place.  We ate there several times and each meal was better than the previous!!!  A++++++++++
"Wow is all I can say. I thought PF Changs would be outdated after 13 years of being away but no way! Still great, if not better! This particular one is fantastic. try the TUNA TATAKI plate. sooo good! GREAT Value for money"
"My family of 4 ate here.  Two of us vegetarian.  The kids are 6 and 9 .  We did the deal for 2 with soups, appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert. For $45.  They had vegetarian dumplings, but no entree and would not sub vegetarian entree from the main menu for some reason.  No kid menu.  The food we got was good and we all ate something, but I didn't find protein for the two vegetarians.  Service was good."
"Love this restaurant, great, tasty food, service with a smile, big portions and nice atmosphere!!! the night we were dining the Miss America finalists were also dining which gave a great buzz to the place. 5 out of 5 and can't wait to go back!!!"
"PF Changs offers a varied menu with some really good appetizers.  My favorite is the Crispy Green Beans.  Appetizer size was enough for 2-3 people (women).  If you go at 5:30 or later you can expect to wait for a table, but you can also eat at the 2 bars (one upstairs and one down).  Went there 2 times during my 4 day stay and was glad I did."
"food was tasty and served large portions had to take it home in a doggy bag and ate it for late night snack, but the kids loved it, the scenery was very nice, they had a birthday party in the service was ok."
went with the kids.  and they loved the kids favorites like mongolian beef.  always yummy you know what you're getting.  my wife was ready to go back but there were too many other things to try.   it's a safe bet and a sure thing for families with kids.
"nice food, great atmosphere
long wait for a table, which had been booked in advance
The wait for the food spoilt are evening.......would not visit again"
Very good food and service for a chain restaurant. I was very impressed. Pricing was honest too. Staff was all over us  - we didn't want for anything. This one is easy to recommend.
"I love Chinese but the service at this particular PF Chang really impressed me. Well done, I'll be back next time I hit Vegas."
"I wrote a review previously about PF Chang where i was so impressed, there is nothing i can say that is new to my previous visit but i thought it was even better than the time before. If you have visited before try on your next visit to try something new, the waitor said this to us when we visited their restaurant in Chicago, we ignored this and had the same again but when we went back to Las vegas we tried other meals on the menu and where mightly impressed."
My Boyfriend and I just got back from a fabulous trip to vegas and needless to say the first day we hit it full force! Thank goodness for P.F. Changs and their happy hour!!! We enjoyed some much needed half price dim sum and it was soooo good! Would def go back again!
Perfect midnight snack at the PF Bar to keep you rolling on through the night. I Highly recomend!
"I've been to quite a few PF Changs, and I have to say it's consistent and it's good!
I love the pork dumplings, pan seared :)"
"We love our local PFC's and so it was nice that the one at Planet Hollywood was equally as good.  As for the cost, the four of us ate for what we spent at several casino resturants for a lot less quality food.  It's like comfort food on vacation."
"Visited this restaurant with my husband on recommendation - what a disappointment.  The food was barely warm and of poor quality and a very noisy environment.  The service was slow.

It is very cheap to eat at this restaurant and that reflects in the quality of the food and service.  There are much nicer places to eat reasonably priced food try the Irish Bar in the Luxor Hotel and you will not be disappointed."
"Generally the restaurants in the casinos tend to be very expensive and can be a disappointment.  PF Changs seems to fit the bill nicely as they have a special menu which if I remember correctly is about $45 a couple for 4 courses and in the choices you can get the lettuce wraps, soup, a main dish and a dessert for that reasonable price for 2 people.  That, in casino restaurant terms, is a bargain and the food is pretty good too."
"Great food at good prices. Only wish we had this at home. The staff were helpful and efficent. The scallops were to die for. The steak was great too, but not anything on the scallops."
"This was our third trip to Las Vegas and our third time at P.F. Chang's.  We love the food there and tend to order the same thing each time since it has always been great.  We start with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps which is messy to eat but soooo delicious. Wish I could figure out  what they put in the chicken to make it so good. We also always get the Mongolian Beef which is excellent.  Do ask for it well-done, otherwise you'll get pieces that look uncooked. We tried another dish, it was the Lo-Mein Noodles with chicken in it, another great choice.

Tip: There can be a lengthy wait if you don't have a reservation. If you are just 2 people, try sitting at the bar, there is never much of a wait because most people prefer a booth or table.  My husband and I didn't care about where we sat, we were starving. Instead of the 1 1/2 hour wait for a table, we waited 5 minutes behind a couple at the bar who were leaving and grabbed their seats!

After dinner you can walk around the Mile Shops (I think that's what it's called) inside Planet Hollywood since you are already there."
Another great dinner at PF Changs. Dinner with family on the second floor with a view of the stip led to a memorable evening. I recommend Chang's spicy  chicken.
"I've never had better chinese food than PF Changs

And the one in PH Las Vegas is better than any other PF's I've been too. The atmosphere is a little noisier, but something about it I enjoy more. The staff are quick and energetic, seating times are not long, and its all delicious.

Little hard to find your way in cause the PH casino is confusing and the sign is not too obvious. But worth finding this gem."
"We have been to this particular restaurant on previous trips to Vegas and always make sure it is on our list. The wait was a bit long for a table for 2 (7pm on a Friday so not unexpected). Appy's were a little slow coming out as our main course came before we were finished. The Salt & Pepper calamari is to die for, my absolute favourite. Good wine selection and if you hit up appy hour 3-6 then the deals can't be beat. We will definitely be eating here again when we go to Las Vegas."
"We normally love P.F. Chang's but this time it was terrible. The service was terrible, the first course of food was cold, and we waited more than 40 minutes for anything to come to our table at all. Atmosphere was very loud and was a very young crowd. Would not recommend this particular location."
We were in Vegas for 2 weeks and ate at a range of different places and this was the only place that got us back for a return visit. The food was spectacular and the service was outstanding. Definitely stopping there again this year.
"I love the PF Chang chain, so I must admit I was prepared for disapointment trying to get a table for 17 people on a Friday evening at 7pm.  After a ten minute wait to get tables set up, we were seated and attended to promptly.  With numerous ticket splits and drink requests, our server handled it fantastic.  Same great food, although I do believe the portions were a bit smaller...but what can you expect?  Overall, two thumbs up!"
"Went twice to PF Changs at Planet Hollywood in a 5 day stay.  The place has a great buzz most of the day along with good service and great food.  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps are the best I have ever had, washed down with a long, cool draft Kirin...lovely!  The quality of food represents great value for money - I also ate at Jasmin in the Bellagio, twice as expensive and not as good as PFs.  Certainly worth a visit in a city being overrun by high-end, overpriced restaurants."
Been coming here for 8 years and its still great. You still have to book at busy times - a true sign of quality. If you like Chinese you'll love changs - its all good. Enjoy
"Great food, atmospere and service, could not fault this restaurant. Recommed the Kung pow chicken and the sweet and sour pork"
"During 3 nights of stay on the strip we ate here twice.  It was a tasty, convenient and reasonably priced dinner option. 

Location - The restaurant is on the ground level of Planet Hollywood, which is where we stayed.  Even though you don't, it is a fairly central location on the strip.  

Food - I was pleasantly surprised and would give 3.5 stars.  Even though it may not be the most authentic fare (well it's meant to be fusion) I enjoyed everything I ate here.  I didn't think their famous lettuce wrap was that special but it was delicious nevertheless.  I also tried tried hot and sour soup, fried rice, Singapore style fried noodle, Mahi-mahi and they were all decent.  

Service - It was professional and efficient.

Ambiance -  I thought the place had a nice, sleek decor.  It gets busy and loud but it is Vegas.

Value - I thought price was fairly reasonable here. 

Overall, I enjoyed eating here and would recommend it."
"Enjoyed a nice family dinner here for 5 people for less than $20/pp not including drinks.  The mongolian beef and the kung pao scallops were ridicuously tasty.  The Chang's chicken was only OK, and the buddha's veggies (steamed) were decent but somewhat plain.  Their hot and sour soup and egg drop soups were both excellent, their desserts average at best.  Service was slow as they were quite busy and understaffed in the kitchen, but the servers were trying their best.  Reliable good Asian fusion, would return in the future for sure, if for no other reason that the scallops and mongolian beef.  Did we mention they were fantastic?"
"My wife and I usually love PF Changs. We eaten at them all over the west. However, the food at the PF Chang's at Planet Hollywood was bland and tasteless. Had to wait over an hour for a table, which was OK in this location because we could gamble 30 feet outside the door in the casino. Maybe they were just having a bad night."
"We really enjoyed our dinner. Our waiter Richie was nice and answered our questions concerning the menu. We ordered the honey chicken, steamed dumplings and eggplant-all very good. We also had the little desserts in the shot glasses-the lemon was the best. If the weather is nice, sit outside and watch the people walk by on the strip."
"Vacationing in Vegas and we stayed at PH Towers.  Decided to have lunch at PF Changs.  Was expecting mediocre, chainy, but it was fantastic. Our waitress recommended the seabass and it was fantastic. Also had ahi for a starter some of the best I had in Vegas and on vacation I eat it every meal. Highly recommend it!"
"During our holiday in Vegas we had the pleasure of eating at this Chinese Bistro and I would highly recommend it to anyone for both quality and value.  We had the set meal for two where you are able to choose from a selected menu, soup, starters, mains and desserts at excellent value of $45.  If I return to Vegas I would definetly go back for another meal!"
We went to PF Changs for Dinner.  Great view of the strip.  We went at about 5:30 p.m. so we were seated right away.  Waiter was extremely friendly.  We had a coupon from our hotel when we applied for the Total Rewards cards.  It was for a free Lettuce Wrap appetizer.  We ordered that first and they were delicious and very filling.  My husband ordered the almond chicken entree and I ordered an orange chicked dish.  Both were delicious.  I came home from our trip and went online and downloaded PF Chang's lettuce wrap recipe and made it the very next day.  Brought back great memories.  I would not hesitate to go to PF Changs when we return to Vegas.
"Mongolian Beef was amazing, lettuce wraps fresh and not too spicy, lemon chicken tart and fresh
Busy spot, though, you should make a reservation"
"We eat two okay meals here - nothing special...as a matter of fact, I wasnt overly impressed.  Service was so so.  The thing that really bothered me at age 51 was the fact I didnt bring my I.D. and I was refused a drink.  I suppose it was my fauly...but this was the only place where I was physically asked to show it...Tried to negotitate with common sense about this to a firm no service.  Came back with friends a few days later and wasnt even asked for I.D.  go figure..."
"We were there during Homecoming or something because the top floor was packed with well dressed teeangers. At first we were worried that service would be slow but our waiter (his name escapes me now) was awesome! Our drinks were never empty, our food was served timely, and he even took the time to chat with us so we never felt ignored. You can get PF Changs' food almost anywhere but we will return to the PH because the service was unbeatable!"
"One of the best meals I had in Vegas, absolutely delicious Chinese Food, in a great location.  Service was excellent but even though we reserved a table we had a 20 minute wait when we arrived."
"Really rushed service; main meal came as we were still eating the starter.
Ate in Chin Chin New York New York a few nights later and this was far better service and food."
Awesome food. Recommended to us by a co worker of my husbands. Will definitely go back next time we are in Vegas.
"I had the double fried noodles, wife had honey chicken.  Mine was way too rich.  The first couple of bites were awesome but got saltier and saltier the more I ate it.  It would have been nice to have some white rice to eat with it.  Honey chicken was excellent, so I heard.  We went there again and had a meal of happy hour appetizers.  We had the lettuce wraps, stuffed wontons, and egg rolls.  Egg rolls were very good but cold in the middle.   Lettuce wraps were awesome.  Wantons were good.  The over-flavored entree I had the first time left a bad impression on me.  I was hungry but couldn't finish eating it.  It had a great atmosphere and was reasonably priced."
"I'm not a fan of chinese food but my wife is so it was with no real enthusiasum i went there, but then the starter came and i was hooked. Service was first class, location fantastic and food that was to die for. I shall be going back there when i return to Vegas Sept 10"
"This must be the best chineese restaurant i have ever been to, its just so good this is my second time there its out of this world, the food is so fresh and the service is excellent, it is always buisy you might after wait a bit for a table but its worth it i love it."
"We went to PF Changs at around 6:30pm on a Sunday night and waited aproximately 30 minutes.  We spent the time wandering the Miracle Mile shops and the PH casino so time passed quickly.  We then got seated and had Kimmie as our waitress, she was really fun.  The food was very good and not very expensive for the strip, the same as any other PF Changs if you have ever been to one.  We both had vegetarian dishes which were delicious and plentiful as we had left overs to take back to the room.  I also had a few Coors Lights which were $3 a bottle and my fiance had the Sake Flights, whcih for 3 were $12.  Our entire meal with drinks was approx. $40, which was very reasonable in my opinion and served as lunch in the room a few days later."
"Bistros are supposed to be pretty quick.  Between the wait for a table (bar's always full) and slow service, this PF Chang's definitely is not.  Plan on spending 1 1/2 hours to eat here."
I've spent much less for better asian cuisine. had to wait even with a reservation. Table was dirty when we were seated
"Restaurant was clean, nice atmosphere.  Food was excellent, but the portions were huge.  Meals definitely could be shared."
"Easy walk from our room at the Marriott Grand Chateau. Standard PF Changs fare at the usual prices, which surprised us. Daniel, our server, did a great job in spite of being very busy."
I am so glad we finally got to try this place out. Everything on everyones plate was great. Can't wait to try PF Changs out close to our home!!!
"We finally made it to PF Chang's on our 11th trip to Vegas, despite having plans to visit on earlier trips.

Wish we had tried it earlier!  The food was excellent and very good value for money.  We certainly intend to return on future trips and think it will be one of our regular haunts."
This is a great value on the strip.  The food is excellent and the prices cant be beat!
"Food was adequte, server could not limit his opiions.

Its a cahin buit it has good food. Don'yt expect it to be your local Chines place!"
"PF Chang's is always good and this one was no exception.  Enjoyed the outdoor seating on a beautiful day.  We stayed at Planet Hollywood and considered venturing further, but knew we would get a great meal at a great price, so we just stuck with PF Chang's.  Glad we did!"
"We were staying at Planet Hollywood and went to P.F. Chang's on our first night. We had never been to a P.F. Chang's before, I have no clue where the closest one would be to our hometown in Indiana. It is much like Chin Chin's at New York/New York, where we had eaten at our last trip to Vegas. Big portions at great prices. We ordered the pork wontons for an appetizer, they were pretty good. You get six of them. I ordered the almond and cashew chicken, which was pretty good, not spicy at all (which I had hoped for). You are given a few sauces to put on your food for added flavor. My boyfriend got a spicy chicken dish, he said it was a lot like General Tso chicken, which is his favorite chinese dish. Our bill was $33 before tip. We will go back again on a future trip."
Just simple american chinese food but with great atmosphere and great value.  Why spend $50 a plate when you can have good food for $20ish
"Ordered my usual, orange beef.  Was a bit dry and overcooked."
"Ate here twice on last trip. Honey shrimp one time and honey chicken the next. Hot and sour soup both times. Service was great and food was perfect. Have eaten here around 7 times on 4 different trips, service is always friendly and food is great everytime. A good solid choice if don't want to spend a lot for good meal."
"It's my 3rd time in LAS in the last 2 years alone.  Everytime I go, I must say, I eat here at least twice during the stay.  The food is very flavorful, and always cooked to perfection.  The service is great, and the atmosphere is really nice.
 We eat a lot of the Ma Po Tofu, as well as the Great Wall of Chocolate Cake.  The tofu is a little spicy, but it's a great kick!  
A few really memorable dishes of theirs during ALL my visits would be the Dynamite Shrimp, Sichuan Style Green Beans, and even their lunch bowls are fantastic!!  I would higly recommend this place if you're looking for food with great flavor and flare!"
"I have ate at many PF Changs and Pei Wei establishments and always enjoyed the menu.  This particular PF Changs did an outstanding job at cooking the meat dishes.  Everything was tender and moist full of flavor.  

Spent about $60 per couple.  Would definately make a return visit."
"It's fine.  I like PF Chang.  The restaurant is a chain, familiar to most people."
"lovely setting, great atmosphere. the food is great and excellent value for money."
"Wherever we are, we'll go to P.F. Chang's.  Gotta get some of those chicken lettuce wraps!  P.F. Chang's offered a casino coupon for free lettuce wraps, so we were there!  The bistro in Planet Hollywood met all of our expectations. It was a great break from the ever-present buffets. The lunch bowls, along with the free lettuce wraps and water, made it a very inexpensive meal - $17 for two people (and we left with doggie bags for dinner). The food was well-prepared and consistent with our expectations of any P.F. Chang's. The atmosphere encourages the diner to relax, take some time away from all that frenzied gaming activity. The service was nothing special, but adequate. It got better when the server realized that he had been tipped well."
"The food was a very good value as it is at all PF Chang's.  You can get a coupon for a lettuce wrap at Planet Hollywood if you go to get a comp card (for those who haven't been to PF Chang's, this is a must).  We sat outside and currently looking at construction, but it was still nice at night.  If on a budget or don't want to gamble on someplace you haven't eaten before, it is a good choice."
"The last time we ate here there were no seats, so we had to eat at the bar, however this was not a problem, as the food was of the usual high standard1"
We ate here with friends and it was so great. Very reasonable and will be going back next year. Ask to see the menu for dinner for 2 @ $39.95
"I enjoyed the Kung Pow Shrimp with scallops added.  Delicioso.

Service good.

Nice place"
"We ate here for a dinner on a busy friday night, without anyvreservation there is a little wait, 15mins or so, but there's a comfortable bar with good drinks menu to help the time go by. Having been used to the usual british version of the chinese restaurant, it was a little suprising some of the choices on the menu, but having taken the chance on something different, I wasn't disappointed. The mandarin chicken was fantastic and such a big portion, it's going to be such a disappointment eating chinese food anywhere else. The prices are reasonable, $40 for two people, main courses and two cokctails each(also highly recommend the plum collins!!!). We'll be back here as soon as we can!"
"We never, ever miss stopping here when in Vegas.  You usually have to wait 1/2 to 1 hr. but you can wait right outside the doors and play the slots.  The food is always so good - have never had a bad meal and whenever we take anyone new there, they become fans as well.  The lettuce wraps and mongolian beef are two of our favourite dishes.  They used to have a Pin Noodle Soup which was very spicy and good but they don't have it on the menu any more.  The prices are very reasonable and you will definately leave full.  It averages out to about $15.00 a person - when there was 5 of us once it cost $60, so well worth the cost.  Recommend PF Changs to anyone we know going to Vegas."
A quick affordable lunch. About $10 for 2 courses including rice. Recommend the sticky chicken. The mini deserts are a must at a steal at $2. Great view of all the passers by on the strip in front of the hotel.
"We were staying in Vegas for 2 weeks and we ate here twice during our stay because the food was such great value and tasted so good. This place is great if you want a good meal with a nice atmosphere and are looking for a chinese that isn't trying too hard to be something else. 

We would recommend the lemon pepper shrimp as it was a dish we hadn't tried before and we loved it. The portions are large and it is a good idea to order dishes to share as it would be difficult to eat the whole plateful of shrimp to yourself!

We couldn't manage dessert but they looked great. They have a selection of extremely large desserts, but have cleverly designed about 6 desserts which are only $2 and are served in a small glass for those of us who have eaten too much already but still want something sweet to finish the meal.

Apparently the key lime cheescake martini is one of their specials  but we didn't try it (the lady next to us at the bar had one and it looked amazing). This place is always busy but from what we saw nobody had to wait long for a table. If you're worried call in advance - even if it's just an hour or so. 

If you get a table by the window or outside, there is a partial view of the Bellagio fountains."
"I have been to pf changs a few times before, however this time was by far the best in terms of great-tasting food.  For some reason, the food was orgasmic!  It may have been the many drinks I had before, or it could just be that they had some good chefs working there at the time.  The four of us, two couples, arrived at 9:00 and it was a 30 minute wait.  We drank a couple of bloody mary's while waiting at the bar, the they were pretty good.  Our appetizers included the lettuce wraps and bbq ibs were excellent.  In addtion, we had some hot and sour soup which was delicious.  We had the mongolian beef, cantonese scallops, dan dan noodles, and sesame chicken.  The mongolian beef and scalllops were to die for, and the other two entrees were good as well."
"After three days in Vegas, I had come to the conclusion restaurants in general were way overpriced. Then my wife and I happened across PF Chang's in Planet Hollywood on the strip. Looking at the menu, we were pleasantly surprised to see prices that matched what we see in Chinese restaurants back home - the most reasonably priced meal we had in Vegas! The food was very good, possibly the best Chinese I've had.
Service was a bit slow at first  - it took about ten minutes for someone to even come over and say hello - and the place was half empty. Once we had the waitress's attention however, she was excellent. The atmosphere was dark and rather bland - nothing special. Overall, I would definitely recommend PF Chang as a very good meal at a great price."
"Eating here is very fun and tasty.  I wouldnt say its the cheapest chinese food but it is very good and very good quality.  I highly recommend the shrimp dumplings, pan fried."
My wife and I ate here for the very first time in april and will be back whenever we visit Vegas again.  I had the pepper steak and she had changs spicey chicken and we loved both.  The lettuce wraps are wonderful and much bigger than we ever figured they would be
"PF Chang's is national chain with respectable Americanized versions of Chinese food.   Not especially authentic or memorable, but pretty good mid-grade Chinese-style food.  Fairly reasonable prices by rapidly-escalating Vegas standards, won't totally blow your entertainment budget for large groups.  Reasonably good service.   Nice decor."
"Everything is just ""OK"".  Service, food, value.  OK.  Not bad.  Not great either. It's a chain and it shows.   It's an Americanized Asian menu.  Don't expect true Asian cuisine or you'll be disappointed for sure.  But at least they don't seem to serve those awful ""chicken balls"" with that syrupy red sauce you get from your local ""Chinese take out"" shop back home.  They forgot my side of asian slaw until I managed to get a server's attention.  My entree was done by the time the ""side"" made it to the table.  Despite there being lots of tables available they made us wait over 10 minutes to be seated. And having just arrived after a long flight, we were really hungry! There are lots of great places to eat in Vegas at moderate prices - this isn't one of them.  Wouldn't recommend to a friend."
"Went here a couple of years ago for dinner and it was pretty good when were were with a big group and shared a bunch of dishes.  Just two of us went here for lunch and neither of us were that fond of our special lunch dishes.  They seemed to be prepared in bulk and appeared to have sat out at the window for a while before making it to the table.  The sauce on both of our dished had almost gelled up and it could have been hotter temperature wise.  A bit disappointed with our second visit.  Would try this place again, just not the lunch menu."
food was very good and a nice place to eat.  drinks were good too!
Who doesn't love Chang's!!
it's always good but I didn't quite like the  location
"My wife and I ate at P.F. Chang's on Thursday, 10/23, for lunch.  We had an outstanding waitress who made very good food and drink suggestions.  Service was quick and efficient and the drinks and food were delicious.  We will definitely eat at P.F. Chang's again when we are in Las Vegas."
"Sick of getting ripped off on the strip? This provides a nice compromise. A place with large portions, vegetables and brown rice where one can be seated outside. Finally! Service was good and inside Planet Hollywood."
yummy crab wontons!!
"My husband and I ate at PF Chang's in July 2008.  This was our second experience at a Chang's but our first in Vegas.  We made reservations about 2 months ahead and were seated within minutes upon our arrival.  The waiter was very attentive and our meals were served quickly.  We had the pan fried dumplings and calemari as appetizers, both were very good.  My husband had the lo mein and I had the spicy chicken.  We ordered aspargus and garlic noodles on the side.  We forgot what large portions they give you and ended up taking a doggie bag back to our hotel.  The meal was excellent and the atmosphere nice.  Although, it was a bit crowded and a crying baby took away from the experience (not PF Chang's fault), it was still an enjoyable meal at a reasonable price too!"
Another favorite. Shrimp in lobster sauce it great
Always a safe bet...
Always a good choice for Contemporary Chinese food.
i love pf changs i eat there about 5 times a week everytime its great and cheap.the lettuce wraps are great and the singapore street noodles are great as well. and great service at every visit.
"it is no longer thee Aladdin Hotel & casino but Planet Hollywood. this restaurant is one of the finest chinese cuisines around. freshly seasoned, spicy and flavor packed everything!!"
"We were in Vegas from the 12- 19th of December and as a number of our group love Chinese food I recommended this restaurant after some good reviews I'd had from the forum. 

The restaurant is great. We made the mistake of going on a Saturday without a reservation, although this only meant a wait of about 45 minutes. Well worth it in my opinion. We were served by Jeff who we were told was training that day however we got a first class service from him, he even offered to take a photo of our group as someone wanted a photo.  We thought we may be rushed as they were so busy however we weren’t rushed at all and ate in comfort with our soft drinks being refilled without any problems or waiting. A few of us were vegetarian and were a little cautious however there is no need to be there were various choices available to us. 

A couple of things that made eating their different, they mix up a special sauce for each table depending on your choice of how spicy you’d like things and leave it on  the table for you along with everything you need to whip some up yourself should you run out. This will sound odd but here it is anyway the water was nice. (The other restaurants we’d eaten at and had glasses of water served didn’t have very nice water. This was by far the nicest water we had at a restaurant on this trip.) 

I had the vegetarian dumplings and then the chow fun both dishes were fabulous! Although Jeff did warn us about the dishes being family style (this means there is plenty and you probably wouldn't need to order a starter and main each if there are a couple of you that have similar tastes as we found out later) we didn’t listen and ended up stuffed roughly half way through. As a result I’m not able to comment on desert however we were assured by Jeff that they are incredible. 

If I could have I would have eaten there more often on our trip as it happened I could only get there once. This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I hope Jeff passed his assessment and some of you check this restaurant out as it really is outstanding."
"Wonderful, very cool atmosphere"
Delicious as always and a good location if you need to go to a show following dinner.
