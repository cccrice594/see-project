review
"Oh my gosh, best Chinese I've ever had in my life!! And they don't want you to order, so please don't try to.  They ask what you like and they keep it coming. We had beers with our entrees. They brought us chicken, shrimp, pork, beef, wontons etc and after a couple dishes came out they asked if we wanted more.  Which we couldn't fathom because we ate so much. If you are in San Francisco do yourself a favor and eat here!!,Katherine, it's an honor to hear we're the best Chinese food you've ever had in your life! I'm so glad you enjoyed the chicken, shrimp, pork, beef, and wontons. Please come back and see us again soon! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"My son (10yrs) and I went here recently for dinner. I have been before years ago and remembered how good it was. 
We were sat immediately, which was a surprise.. although at a table that needed to be wiped down. And someone came up to us right away which was great. The drinks and food we ordered came out incredibly fast but in no particular order. They were ""dropped"" on our table by a disinterested woman who was yelling at someone else in Chinese. This really didn't bother us, but if you're looking for great service, or someone to walk you through the menu, this is probably not the place. 
We weren't offered ice for the soda or a cold glass for the beer. The soup was lukewarm and the 'sizzling rice' had already been dumped in behind the kitchen. 
All this said, the food was just as good as I had remembered.,I'm glad you and your son enjoyed the food. If your food is ever too cold, or you are unhappy with it for any reason, please let us know, so we can make things right. I'm sorry you weren't pleased with the service, I will pass your feedback on to our servers. I hope you and your son will join us again soon. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"Wowza! The experience is better than A Star recommendations, and probaly the most enjoyable Chinese food I have eaten (and I've been to China 3 times!). We arrived at noon on a Sunday morning, and expected a queue as you cannot book, but there was ample space inside even though all the street tables were full. The food on the next table looked so good we asked the two guys what they were eating. Turns out one was a regular, and was treating his friend from out of town. So, on their recommendations, we chose two HONK staples, the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken with Fried Sweet Potato, and then the astonishing Melt in your Mouth Calamari, with Fried Pork Potstiskers with HONK peanut sauce to start. The waiter (who was I think the owner), then suggested the Sizzling Fried Rice, which was brught to the table indeed sizzling on a very hot plate, and the waiter then scrambled two eggs on the hot plate beside the pile of rice, and stirred everything together - great theatre! We had two bottles of water and three cokes (as it was a hot day), and the bill came to $90 for three. Perhaps not the cheapest, but easily worth it for a fabulous, unforgettable HONK Sunday Lunch."
"Was recommended this place by a cab driver so was looking forward to it.
We were shown inside and seated beside a large pile of boxes, bottles, cooked rice and various other items. We were given a menu and two minutes later asked to order. We ordered drinks and then the waiter appeared immediately asking for our order. We felt rushed.
The food came and it looked good - sesame chicken, salt and pepper shrimp and fried rice. It was thrown onto the table almost with no niceties.  The sesame chicken was extremely salty, the shrimp had lots of herbs in it and actually tasted Italian, the fried rice was tasty. 
As we were eating, one of the proprietors brought a huge metal bowl of hot oil and put it in the table next to us saying ‘Very hot, be careful.’ I could feel the heat coming from it!! 
As we were finishing our food we were aware that tables were being brought in from outside and being stacked. People on the next table said that they must be closing as they had looked on a site that said it closed at 9 but was still open as they passed. It was now 9.30. 
The bill was placed on the table before we asked for it and it was obvious that they wanted us to go. We paid $68 and left.
We were waiting for a cab outside and one of the servers asked us to move along as they were bringing the rubbish out!! Needless to say, this won’t be a repeated experience.
If you like poor surroundings, salty food and the feeling that you are not wanted, get yourself there!!"
"Zero. We waited for 10-minutes to get our orders taken they never took our orders and 3 other tables, prior to us arriving were also waiting to get their orders taken. 

We spoke to three different staff members about getting our orders but no one came. 

We left because it was 15-minutes and didn’t even get our drinks taken.  

Extremely dissatisfied because it had so many good reviews and our first time in Chinatown, SF."
"Absolutely terrible.  Bland, nasty and greasy.  Hot sour soup had zero flavor.  Must have changed owners with the prior good reviews.  Liquor store beef jerky would have tasted better.  should have known to avoid a place that said""we have no egg rolls?""

Horrible"
"We reached there bit late in the day (around 3 PM) but were welcomed by miling staff members. Our table was attended immediately. While we were going over the menu, Peter (the owner) stopped by and inquired about our dietary preference and constraints and took the menu away with a promise that he would fix simething up. What came next was amazing. Chicken, Fish, spring rolls along with seafood wantop soup. Everything was perfectly cooked, tasty and perfectly portioned. A must visit in SF Chinatown. Strongly recommend."
"As others have written, the ownwer met us outside and said he'd take care of us...his choices were excellent!  We had six dishes and each was great. But watch out if your budget's tight: our bill was $170 for five of us.  If you're counting pennies just order what you can afford from the menu. The place looks like a Chinese restaurant should, kind of a hole-in-the-wall place.  But it was clean and service was good."
"After years of locals telling us how amazing House of Nanking is we finally found time to enjoy. Hands down best Chinese food I have ever had. Favorite dishes included the  egg pillows, the pork buns, and the seasoned cucumbers. We were indecisive about the menu, so the server suggested a fish dish (would never be my go to) and it was exceptional. The ambiance, the food, the people watching. I cannot wait to go back."
"This was by far the best Chinese food we’ve had in, um, FOREVER! I have a severe shrimp allergy, so we ate outside, and the server actually moved the heater closer to us to make us more comfortable before we asked. 

We have the egg rolls, yum, then the chicken fried rice mixed at the table. The presentation was as great as the food. 

Speaking of presentation, be sure to get the flower blossom tea, it comes in a mug sized container, and it’s amazing."
"I was here with a group and I have no idea how much the dinner actually cost. But overall, the food was fine. The quality is frankly no different than a Panda Express, and I’ll say that everything is heavily saucy or are fried. But, with good company the food was good. 

It’s an old building just around the corner from all the strip clubs. If you’re looking for an upscale experience, this is not it.,Shu, I appreciate you giving u a try. I'm sorry we didn't knock your socks off, but I hope you will consider giving us another try sometime. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"After seeing the show on TV, our visit to San Francisco included a stop here. It is a very small restaurant with outdoor seating. Typical Chinatown restaurant, lots of supplies and boxes inside the restaurant, diner type seating. The food was good. Our problem was the waitress, we came just as they opened, looked at the menu, server says let me order for you, first mistake was agreeing, second mistake was not telling her our budget. Lunch cost $150 USD plus tip for lunch for 4 people, drinks were two cokes and two beers. I think she served us the most expensive items on the menu. Although the food was good, this left a bad taste in my mouth, felt like we were taken advantage of. This was my first and last time at House of Nanking."
"We decided have Chinese for dinner while in San Francisco and so, trusting the many positive reviews, we paid a visit to this restaurant, not far from Columbus, where our hotel was. Menus were greasy and dirty as well as the floor, waitress was a bit rude and, aside from the shrimp we took as starter, main courses (fried calamari and chicken) were overcooked so we decided to leave without finish em. On top, bill was really expensive. Never again.,I appreciate you giving us a try, but I'm sorry you didn't have a good experience. Your feedback has been noted. If you are ever unhappy with anything we have served, please let us know -- we are happy to make things right. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"Lily, our waitress is excellent.  She took time to explain the different entrees for someone who does not understand Chinese well.  Portion size is just right.   Will definitely come back the next time we visit SFO again."
"Great food, preserved the sesame chicken and chicken with green beans.  The chicken with green beans was not breaded or fried, and very tender. Quick, friendly service and good period size."
"We were told from a few people to try here. 
We called in and there was a few free tables inside, we got seated straight away and our orders were taken. 
We went for the special Nanking chicken dish and a pork belly dish, we shared one rice and two bottles of water. 
The food was lovely both the dishes were very tasty. 
A nice place for a quick bite to eat, this isn’t the sort of place to come for a posh meal, it’s the sort of place to come to get a nice tasty meal. 
Our 2 dishes, rice and bottles of water came to $50. 
I definitely recommend here for a meal."
What an experience! We were asked about food allergies and what types of food do we like then handed the menus back. We were told that they would bring our food out family style. What a surprise to try each dish. It was excellent and delicious. The kids and adults were so impressed and enjoyed each dish that was served. I highly recommend this to any family visitng China Town.
"The sesame chicken was maybe the nest I’ve ever had. The food was a little pricey for what we got but we were in vacation mode so it wasn’t that bad. Good food and good service. I would eat there again. As a quick side note: the pork dumplings were very good as well.,Sean, It's great to hear that our sesame chicken was the best you've ever had! I'm glad you would like to eat here again and I hope we get the chance to serve you some more chicken and dumplings soon. 

All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
I typed in best Chinese in San fransisco and this place came up and others but I liked the sound of the name 😂 we were seated quick and I ordered shezchuan chicken but got sesame chicken instead but glad I did it was beautiful. My husband asked for curry and got satay.  We had people sitting next to us and it turned out it was the pilots that flew us to San Francisco what a coincidence and we also  were near people we met on a tour that day. The pilots told us that Jamie Oliver came to learn Chinese food in the restaurant and that keanu reaves was there filming the matrix there. There are pictures in the wall of both of them. Great restaurant the food is beautiful and massive portions so one curry could do 2 people and reasonable prices too. Definetly recommend anyone visiting the restaurant
"Great restaurant in San Fransisco’s Chinatown. You tell them what you like and don’t like and they decide what food to bring you. The key is that you have to say you are full or the plates (and bill) keep coming, but it is awesome and authentic. Best food in Chinatown and great staff. Very clean too. Perfect for families or couples."
"Honestly, the owner/sever was actually very friendly and nice. He also posted a lot of pictures of his awards in the past. We actually ordered the food he was proud of his restaurant, but to my surprise, they were terrible according to my taste. We were in San Francisco for 5 days and we went to at least 10 different Chinese restaurants in the China Town area including some of the very cheap Mama Papa store and formal ones, nothing like this one. Very disappointing food."
Very disappointed.  Read all the great reviews so we drove into the city today to enjoy a great meal.  In all honesty the shrimp and chicken entrees we had were not half as good as our neighborhood Panda Express entrees and they cost twice as much at Nanking.
"Four of us were here for lunch on a Saturday.  We weren't sure what to order so the owner himself took our menus and said he would send out food for us.  And he sure did!  We had an absolutely delicious feast! The rice soup with clams and steamed buns were my favorites, but everything was fantastic.  Definitely let them order for you! 

The only reason for 4 stars was the service wasn't great.  We ordered drinks and only 3 of the 4 came.  We had to ask twice more to get the last drink.  Also we asked for waters for the table and only 1 water came, so had to ask about that a few times as well."
"This was recommended to me by a Ca friend and then again by my SF hotel. So off we went!  Got a table for 6 right away even though they don't take reservations.  This was almost a month ago, but it might have been the early virus warnings were making people stay home.  Food was superb. Since we were 4 adults, two of which are vegetarians, plus 2 kids, our selections were diverse.  But everyone loved their food.,Moey, I'm so glad you took the recommendation to dine with us, and that you enjoyed your meal here. We appreciate the kind words, and we hope you will dine with us again the next time you are visiting. 

All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"For me, eating in Chinatown is a must-do when visiting San Francisco. However, it is hard to find a restaurant that consistently gets great reviews, probably as most are catering to tourists. House of Nanking was good but nothing really special and not much different than the better Chinese restaurants we have in the Twin Cities. Now if you live somewhere where you have to drive miles to find a good Chinese meal, you will probably be quite pleased with the food here. Potstickers were good. Fried rice being made tableside was a nice touch. The sesame chicken was pretty average.  Busy place but we were able to get a table without too much wait on a weekday night.  Service was a bit frenzied and was no nonsense and tables in the 2-room restaurant were close together and the place weirdly had boxes of drinks, food and supplies stacked all over the dining area, but I sort of expect and want this chaos as it gives the place a more authentic vibe. There is also outdoor seating on the sidewalk with heating lamps which looked more relaxed. I would rate this as a good place to eat dinner if wanting to find a place in Chinatown but keep expectations in check regarding the food experience."
"We are a group of 4 traveling friends attending a conference in San Francisco.  We decided to eat at the House of Nanking for an outside lunch after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. The Chinatown neighborhood was picturesque. The curbside dining was fun.  Even though it was a bit chilly, the outdoor heaters and wooden shelter were enough to keep us toasty.  The food and service were first class. We shared Nanking Sesame Chicken with Glazed Sweet Potatoes; Hot and Sour Soup; Sizzling Rice Soup and Spicy Garlic Long Beans. We also had the hot Lotus Tea.  All of the meals were excellent.  We highly recommend this small ""gem"" in the big city."
"Possibly the worst Chinese food we’ve had. Sesame chicken was mostly breading, smothered in a sweet sauce, and not a large portion for $18. Other tables ordered same thing and theirs seemed bigger? Potstickers were deep fried. They were ok but I’ve had much better. Very touristy due to some Food Network connection? Not worthy of the crowd. I don’t recommend.  (While in SFO we also ate at Lai Hong Lounge which had fabulous food and friendly warm service)"
"Oh Wow, let’s talk Chines food, this place will take you to another dimension . We didn’t know what to order so we told waiter surprise us. It is beyond good, everyone there meant business they got your food right to you and with a smile, we can’t thank you enough for such great food , highly suggest you try it."
We had visitors in town who recommended the restaurant because they saw it on food network. What a surprise to be greeted by the chef and then he asked if we’d mind him ordering for us since it was our first time. He accounted for one shrimp allergy and sent the next shareable delicious plates one after the other. Everything was sooo good even the chicken fried rice prepared at the table for a visual treat!
"Bad service, you basically set yourself up because they put plates and glasses in the center. As soon as you finish the dish they blow it away and with the mouthful still full they put the bill on the table. I didn't tip him."
"We have been coming to this place for 20 years, however this time it was a disappointment.  The hot and sour soup lacked the balance between hot and sour.. too much vinegar.  In the past the chef would make dishes for his guests based on what they preferred.  The beef, shrimp and cauliflower stir fry was meh.  Their signature chicken sesame dish was blah.  The chef is obviously not present as before and the food is not as tasty and fresh as before.  The wait staff were wonderful, fast and helpful.  So sorry to see this great place going down the hill."
"Tried the food here while visiting SF.  One of the best chinese foods I have had for a long time.

Mogu fish was superb - do try it.
Veg options - egg plant dishes and green beans were great.  
A chicken dish we got was amazing too.

Overall we felt that the dishes had a good mix of spice - yes, its not bland and very tasty.

The chef Peter Fang does care about his guests."
"Not much on ambience and place is crowded. 

Need to be fairly quick in knowing what you want. 

Service is OK but no set waiter (we had four different attendants. 

Food was fresh and delicious. A little more Chinese Chinese rather than American Chinese. 

Crispy beef (very tender) and bok choy was excellent.  House noodles a bit bland. 

Starters OK. 

Reasonable prices."

"When we researched top-shelf authentic Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, HoN was listed in the top five, so we gave it a try. When you arrive the place looks very much like a hole in the wall restaurant, but don’t let that fool you. Step inside, imagine that you’re in any metropolitan city in China, find a seat, if you can, and order some of the most sublime wonton soup you’ll ever eat (not the ubiquitous watery, soy sauce infused weak pork broth with a tasteless dumpling and maybe a few slices of green onion floating on top you find in “American-style Chinese restaurants!) - HoN’s soup served two and had the most delicious, rich broth with tons of umami, perfect dumplings and crispy rice and seasoning. The side of egg rolls were the best I’ve ever had, and tasted made to order. The hot tea will blow you away with warmth and flavor, just don’t mind the dried flower floating around that gives it just a touch of floral bouquet. Make this one of your go-to spots in Chinatown for great authentic Chinese cuisine."
Amazing food!  We got shrimp pockets and tofu steamed buns for appetizer. Split house noodles with tofu.  Had black bean sauce that was perfect! Everything looked great and everyone around us was loving their food. Outside or inside dining.  Busy place but they keep it moving.  Was a past “Chopped” on Food Network winner!

(While in SFO we also ate at Lai Hong Lounge which had fabulous food and friendly warm service)"
We ordered sesame chicken and a shrimp appetizer with 1 “large” sake and the bill was $100 . All the food was fried and overcooked. I didn’t know the items were fried as menu does not indicate that. It was disappointing.
"Don’t judge a book by it s cover. The setting is super basic. However, food is excellent!
It is a fast moving restaurant - so don’t expect to have a romantic dinner. 
Well worth to go there!"
"This place has a long line and is popular with both tourists and locals.  You share a long table with other guests and the servers are somewhat aggressive.  We may have over ordered a bit, but everything was good."
"Went to the House of Nanking after consulting TripAdvisor for recommendations in Chinatown. And we did not get disappointed. Fast and friendly service. Delicious food. The setting is very basic, so don’t have any romantic expectations. 
Will definitely come back."
"OK, it's not a 5 (nothing is) , but it's better than a 4. Make it a 4 1/2. I see that it's a Tripadvisor Choice. Rightly so. if you've never been to Chinatown in San Francisco, or even if you have, it's one of the most unique and magical atmospheric places in the U.S. Restaurants and shops abound. But most restaurants have fronts that remind you of a warehouse. The food may be good, but there's no come hither look. What is your idea of what you want to see in Chinatown?  House of Nanking evokes what Chinatown is all about, both in store front, ambience,  and in dining quality. The food is excellent, and the service was very personal and friendly. One word of warning- The dining area is one flight up from street level. Good food. Good ambience. A  4 1/2."
"As they say in the description, they put their own original creative twist on known recipes. Given that I was alone, I was only able to try 2 dishes: the hot and sour soup and eggplant and sweet potatoes. The eggplant and sweet potatoes was an interesting and delicious dish.  The hot and sour soup was different from any other hot and sour soup I’ve ever had.  They added vegetables to it to give it and entirely different taste, also very yummy.  There are as many tables as possible crowded into a small space, but this adds to the ho et atmosphere.  They also have outside tables, which were all taken despite the cold weather.  Prices are reasonable. Service was quite rapid."

"An extraordinary expirience.
One of the best chinese restaurants that I have been in.
We were 8 people friends and the menu was exquisite.
Prices reasonable
the restroom very nasty, no clean, no suitable for women"
"amazing food.  this was recommended to me so we ubered over there.  They will make fried rice at the table, the sesame chicken was the best i have ever had.  beautiful flowered tea  Nice people.  Packed.  everyone loved their food"

"My husband and I were in San Francisco for a few days over spring break and decided to pop in for a late lunch with our daughters, ages 14 and 9. The chef greeted us and when we told him this was our first time to visit, he asked if he could order for us. After confirming we didn't have any food allergies and aren't picky eaters, he prepared an amazing six-course lunch for us. From appetizers to soup to main dishes and fried rice, it was delicious. We will definitely return, and have the chef order for us, the next time we are in the Bay area!"
"My local cousin said we lucked out when we were able to grab lunch at this popular Chinatown restaurant. At home, our Chinese options tend to be “La Choy bland” or over spiced. It’s a treat to enjoy true flavorful Chinese dishes. Our black sesame noodles and peanut tofu were spicy but not so much it drowned the other flavors. Their wonderful tea was a bonus on a drizzly day."
We had visitors in town who recommended the restaurant because they saw it on food network. What a surprise to be greeted by the chef and then he asked if we’d mind him ordering for us since it was our first time.

"I would like to reiterate the review from someone who visited in 2017. And here we are in 2023…6 years later! My husband was hungry, I wasn’t so much, so I decided to have the Spicy Wonton Soup. It was truly the most amazing soup I’ve had my entire life!!!  The taste, texture….there was a crunch I describe as just the perfect linger….a tiny bit chewy but not chewy crunchy…with every bite! It was amazing!!!! I would spend my days trying to learn to make that divine soup if I had the recipe! Thank you for opening my world!"
"Too quick welcome, no customer service, 
Meals served in wrong sequence and all in a dirty and messy environment 
Have been many times in China, many places, different styles, premium, friendly.. but this one is absolutely not a good option and moreover not that tasty, so don’t tell me it’s Chinese style of a kind 
Last but not least I decided not to leave any tips (rare thing for me) to show my disappointment and waiter told me I must leave a tip in agressive way, she was surprised and forced me to give one!!! 
One of my worst experience over last 20 years"
We waited a brief ten minutes for a table and was seated at first site of an opening. The ambiance is neat and quick. We should have been looking at the menu while waiting but we got our orders in quickly. Order three dishes to share and try the pork belly dish. Spicy dishes are flavorful and not really spicy.
"As a Chinese frm China, I have to review this worst; totally not Chinese, weird, dirty, bad service."
"Nanking was once at the pinnacle of Chinese cuisine in San Francisco; this was
maybe 20 years ago. All of six of us agreed that the presentation and taste was
greasy, fried, shinny and not good. The service was without a smile. The interior is not very pleasant with stacked boxes and supplies. Stay away until they change chefs."
"The best Chinese I have ever had & the 1st in China town.  On holiday from England this place was recommended by our 'hippy tour' guide.
We sat outside undercover and chose from a small but varied menu. I had a garlic chicken dish with a couple of sides which was all 10/10. 
Just simple beautiful food."

All of the meals were excellent.  We highly recommend this small ""gem"" in the big city."
"We went in knowing what we wanted to eat, boss came over said ‘you order something, I order something’ then proceeded to give us food that we did not want. We especially wanted the sizzling rice but ended up not getting that because we were stuffed."
"Four of us were here for lunch on a Saturday.  We weren't sure what to order so the owner himself took our menus and said he would send out food for us.  And he sure did!

Our 2 dishes, rice and bottles of water came to $50. 
I definitely recommend here for a meal."
"Wowza! The experience is better than A Star recommendations, and probaly the most enjoyable Chinese food I have eaten (and I've been to China 3 times!). We arrived at noon on a Sunday morning, and expected a queue as you cannot book, but there was ample space inside even though all the street tables were full. The food on the next table looked so good we asked the two guys what they were eating. Turns out one was a regular, and was treating his friend from out of town. So, on their recommendations, we chose two HONK staples, the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken with Fried Sweet Potato, and then the astonishing Melt in your Mouth Calamari, with Fried Pork Potstiskers with HONK peanut sauce to start. The waiter (who was I think the owner), then suggested the Sizzling Fried Rice, which was brught to the table indeed sizzling on a very hot plate, and the waiter then scrambled two eggs on the hot plate beside the pile of rice, and stirred everything together - great theatre! We had two bottles of water and three cokes (as it was a hot day), and the bill came to $90 for three. Perhaps not the cheapest, but easily worth it for a fabulous, unforgettable HONK Sunday Lunch."
We sat down and the staff asked if we were hungry and if we trusted her.  We said yes to both and were happy for it.  Several dishes came and all were delicious.  This place has lots of business for a reason.  Worth a try if you are in Chinatown.
"This place used to be amazing and now they have completely rested on their laurels. WORST food I've had in a long time. Service even WORSE. The food they put in front of us was an absolute EMBARASSMENT. WAY over-salted, NOT fresh, just a complete mess. TRASH TRASH TRASH-"
This has been recommended by a friend from Canada and was well worth the fund. Get the server to do the choosing for you. We did and the food was a treat.
"Fast service, but greasy food and unbalanced flavours. We had the house specialty, sesame chicken and the pork belly with a side of green beans. The pork belly meat was dry and the fat was greasy. I don’t know how they managed it. Very expensive compared to our Chinese restaurant at home."
Food was absolutely amazing.   Stopped here by chance and cannot think how lucky we were    Thanks Keanu for the recommendation!    Come by and see for yourself why I said that!
"We had heard about this restaurant in Chinatown while we were in San Francisco.   So off we walked to our destination to this oasis of Chinese food. 
     Our hostess spoke broken English, but she conveyed good choices that were excellent.  Brown rice prepared at table side is a treat to behold."
"We were recommended this restaurant by one of the city information guides and it was excellent. We ordered the chicken and sesame and chicken and green beans, both dishes were really tasty and the portions more than ample. The service was very pleasant and we felt well looked after. We ate outside, it was warm as there were some heaters strategically placed near the tables. We loved it so much we have booked to visit the sister restaurant Fangs later on in the week."
Not sure of the appeal. Mogu beef was a strange weird fried cut with cauliflower. Famous sesame chicken was overly flavoured and way too sweet. I struggle to understand the hype. The calamari was way too salty. The egg fried rice was great and the prep at the table was a good show piece.
"After 12 years I found out, that it is still a very good restaurant.
The Service typical chinese and the food very good Quality and Taste."
"The food was amazing. Tasty and delicious and servings were well portioned.
Service was ok for a Chinese restaurant but definitely could improve on interior decor ☺️"
Looked forward to a meal in Chinatown SFO but what a let down😩 Food was cloying and heavy - ambience not good at all👎
What an experience! We were asked about food allergies and what types of food do we like then handed the menus back. We were told that they would bring our food out family style. What a surprise to try each dish. It was excellent and delicious. The kids and adults were so impressed and enjoyed each dish that was served. I highly recommend this to any family visitng China Town.
"alway come here when im in sfo. 
they ask you what you like and sit back they bring you plate after plate of wonderful food."
"Great restaurant in San Fransisco’s Chinatown. You tell them what you like and don’t like and they decide what food to bring you. The key is that you have to say you are full or the plates (and bill) keep coming, but it is awesome and authentic. Best food in Chinatown and great staff. Very clean too. Perfect for families or couples."
"Oh Wow, let’s talk Chines food, this place will take you to another dimension . We didn’t know what to order so we told waiter surprise us. It is beyond good, everyone there meant business they got your food right to you and with a smile, we can’t thank you enough for such great food , highly suggest you try it."
Very disappointed.  Read all the great reviews so we drove into the city today to enjoy a great meal.  In all honesty the shrimp and chicken entrees we had were not half as good as our neighborhood Panda Express entrees and they cost twice as much at Nanking.
"Honestly, the owner/sever was actually very friendly and nice. He also posted a lot of pictures of his awards in the past. We actually ordered the food he was proud of his restaurant, but to my surprise, they were terrible according to my taste. We were in San Francisco for 5 days and we went to at least 10 different Chinese restaurants in the China Town area including some of the very cheap Mama Papa store and formal ones, nothing like this one. Very disappointing food."
Amazing food. Probably one of the best Asian cuisine I ever had outside of Asia. Really great variety of different dishes.
"Enjoyed a delicious lunch on the patio. The Sesame Chicken with glazed sweet potatoes was a wonderful treat. The green onion cakes did not disappoint. Great stop for a quiet, patio lunch. Highly recommend."
"Great food, preserved the sesame chicken and chicken with green beans.  The chicken with green beans was not breaded or fried, and very tender. Quick, friendly service and good period size."
"Was recommended this place by a cab driver so was looking forward to it.
We were shown inside and seated beside a large pile of boxes, bottles, cooked rice and various other items. We were given a menu and two minutes later asked to order. We ordered drinks and then the waiter appeared immediately asking for our order. We felt rushed.
The food came and it looked good - sesame chicken, salt and pepper shrimp and fried rice. It was thrown onto the table almost with no niceties.  The sesame chicken was extremely salty, the shrimp had lots of herbs in it and actually tasted Italian, the fried rice was tasty. 
As we were eating, one of the proprietors brought a huge metal bowl of hot oil and put it in the table next to us saying ‘Very hot, be careful.’ I could feel the heat coming from it!! 
As we were finishing our food we were aware that tables were being brought in from outside and being stacked. People on the next table said that they must be closing as they had looked on a site that said it closed at 9 but was still open as they passed. It was now 9.30. 
The bill was placed on the table before we asked for it and it was obvious that they wanted us to go. We paid $68 and left.
We were waiting for a cab outside and one of the servers asked us to move along as they were bringing the rubbish out!! Needless to say, this won’t be a repeated experience.
If you like poor surroundings, salty food and the feeling that you are not wanted, get yourself there!!"
"Excellent food, tastes amazing and unique menu. Get there early as they get really busy and tend to have queue. As with most restaurants in SF they close at 8.30pm during the week."
Not like any other wonton soup. The most delicious I have ever tasted.  That was all I tasted but everything looked delicious too.
We appreciated the variety of dishes and beautiful presentations of this very delicious cuisine. We were impressed with everything.
"I ate here and got the salt and pepper shrimp and green onion pancake.  

Service was brusque but I do not care about that.

It is not worth the lines ...it is very good food but not amazing..others nearby also very good with no line

I would go back if no line"
"Lily, our waitress is excellent.  She took time to explain the different entrees for someone who does not understand Chinese well.  Portion size is just right.   Will definitely come back the next time we visit SFO again."
"Excellent.  We have tried a lot of Chinese restaurants in SF, and this is one of the very best.  We made a lunch meal just of soup and appetizers, and it was fabulous.  The Jasmine Blossom tea (a green tea ball in a large glass mug of boiling water) was just the thing to warm up on a chilly Feb day.   The daughter of the owner won a recent TV Chef competition, so the excellence definitely runs in the family.  Enjoy."
"Great service, the chef saw it was our first time and he brought us some food so we could try everything. Really great, if you have a chance you should go"
We LOVED House of Nanking. This restaurant will be in permanent rotation for our yearly SF trip. How did we ever survive without food this good? Thank you!!
"Wow the head server told us to get rid of the menus and he will order for us. And if we did not like the food to send it back.
Great decision everything he ordered for us the soup, appetizers and main course was out of this world. Never eaten every such tasty chinese food in USA.
Must try the curry shrimp with veggies, scallion pancakes, chicken with broccli and chicken rice soup"
"This was by far the best Chinese food we’ve had in, um, FOREVER! I have a severe shrimp allergy, so we ate outside, and the server actually moved the heater closer to us to make us more comfortable before we asked. 

We have the egg rolls, yum, then the chicken fried rice mixed at the table. The presentation was as great as the food. 

Speaking of presentation, be sure to get the flower blossom tea, it comes in a mug sized container, and it’s amazing."
"Food was fabulous.  Loved our table outside (our youngest cannot be vaccinated so prefer outdoor dining).  Everything they recommended was great.  Kids loved it, too."
"After years of locals telling us how amazing House of Nanking is we finally found time to enjoy. Hands down best Chinese food I have ever had. Favorite dishes included the  egg pillows, the pork buns, and the seasoned cucumbers. We were indecisive about the menu, so the server suggested a fish dish (would never be my go to) and it was exceptional. The ambiance, the food, the people watching. I cannot wait to go back."
"Chinese isnt my go to food! but let me say I LOVED everything we ate at NANKING.  The table side made veggie fry rice was outstanding, the chicken and apples DELISH!  even the Wanton Soup was great! not like the east coast Chinese your use to.  Great spot in Chinatown to make you sure you stop by!"
Delish! that’s how I want to start this review! Very busy place but once you start eating you know why! We had the dumplings Yum and never have I had apples and shrimp with mayonnaise and wanted to come back for more! They also will pick meals for you as they did our chicken dish which makes it exciting and scrumptious. Have the sake warm too!
"Really fresh and fantastic flavors, we let chef Peter choose the menu.  The dishes were unique and his own. If you are looking for standard Chinese restaurant grub, this isn’t the place for you. For the price, service and cleanliness could have been a bit more refined."
We had lunch here during our visit to Chinatown and we were so impressed! The service was fantastic and the food was even better! We can't wait to visit again during our next trip to San Francisco! Definitely worth a stop!
"We reached there bit late in the day (around 3 PM) but were welcomed by miling staff members. Our table was attended immediately. While we were going over the menu, Peter (the owner) stopped by and inquired about our dietary preference and constraints and took the menu away with a promise that he would fix simething up. What came next was amazing. Chicken, Fish, spring rolls along with seafood wantop soup. Everything was perfectly cooked, tasty and perfectly portioned. A must visit in SF Chinatown. Strongly recommend."
"Zero. We waited for 10-minutes to get our orders taken they never took our orders and 3 other tables, prior to us arriving were also waiting to get their orders taken. 

We spoke to three different staff members about getting our orders but no one came. 

We left because it was 15-minutes and didn’t even get our drinks taken.  

Extremely dissatisfied because it had so many good reviews and our first time in Chinatown, SF."
This was our first time in Chinatown.  We read some good reviews on TA and decided to give it a try.   So glad we came!  We sat down and immediately they asked if we were hungry and helped us order.  We let our server pick out some new entrees and they were incredible!  The clam wonton soup is one of our new favorites.
"As others have written, the ownwer met us outside and said he'd take care of us...his choices were excellent!  We had six dishes and each was great. But watch out if your budget's tight: our bill was $170 for five of us.  If you're counting pennies just order what you can afford from the menu. The place looks like a Chinese restaurant should, kind of a hole-in-the-wall place.  But it was clean and service was good."
"Hands down the best Chinese food I ever had. Went for lunch with family, owner came and said. Don’t order. I’ll cook for you. We agreed and it was the best decision we could’ve made. From the clam soup, the dumplings, sesame chicken, seafood, fried rice. Just amazing.  Went back and had their noodles and calamari. OMG. GREAT. And great service. A MUST!!!"
"Amazing food and amazing hospitality.  Maybe place doesn't look fancy but food makes up plus some.

Beef with seafood and cauliflower is 👏"
Our family of 6 enjoyed dinner at House of Nanking.  We shared two dishes and an appetizer...the main dishes include plenty of food (though rice is separate).  Our servers were wonderful and prices were reasonable.
I never go to SF without eating at House of Nanking at least once.  I have been eating here at least 15 years and haven't ordered once.  They just bring food and I eat it.
"Absolutely terrible.  Bland, nasty and greasy.  Hot sour soup had zero flavor.  Must have changed owners with the prior good reviews.  Liquor store beef jerky would have tasted better.  should have known to avoid a place that said""we have no egg rolls?""

Horrible"
"This cozy, welcoming Chinese restaurant has a fantastic menu with plates that will satisfy a wide variety of people.  I came here with friends, we ordered a few things and shared, and we loved the fried Chinese eggplant, the mushu tofu, and the house noodles with chicken.,Hi Dusty, thanks so much for taking a moment to share some kind words and fond memories of dining with us. I'm thrilled to hear that the fried Chinese eggplant, the mushu tofu, and the house noodles with chicken were all a hit. I hope will will get the chance to serve you and your crew again in the future. All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"This was recommended to me by a Ca friend and then again by my SF hotel. So off we went!  Got a table for 6 right away even though they don't take reservations.  This was almost a month ago, but it might have been the early virus warnings were making people stay home.  Food was superb. Since we were 4 adults, two of which are vegetarians, plus 2 kids, our selections were diverse.  But everyone loved their food.,Moey, I'm so glad you took the recommendation to dine with us, and that you enjoyed your meal here. We appreciate the kind words, and we hope you will dine with us again the next time you are visiting. 

All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"I was here with a group and I have no idea how much the dinner actually cost. But overall, the food was fine. The quality is frankly no different than a Panda Express, and I’ll say that everything is heavily saucy or are fried. But, with good company the food was good. 

It’s an old building just around the corner from all the strip clubs. If you’re looking for an upscale experience, this is not it.,Shu, I appreciate you giving u a try. I'm sorry we didn't knock your socks off, but I hope you will consider giving us another try sometime. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"The sesame chicken was maybe the nest I’ve ever had. The food was a little pricey for what we got but we were in vacation mode so it wasn’t that bad. Good food and good service. I would eat there again. As a quick side note: the pork dumplings were very good as well.,Sean, It's great to hear that our sesame chicken was the best you've ever had! I'm glad you would like to eat here again and I hope we get the chance to serve you some more chicken and dumplings soon. 

All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"We decided have Chinese for dinner while in San Francisco and so, trusting the many positive reviews, we paid a visit to this restaurant, not far from Columbus, where our hotel was. Menus were greasy and dirty as well as the floor, waitress was a bit rude and, aside from the shrimp we took as starter, main courses (fried calamari and chicken) were overcooked so we decided to leave without finish em. On top, bill was really expensive. Never again.,I appreciate you giving us a try, but I'm sorry you didn't have a good experience. Your feedback has been noted. If you are ever unhappy with anything we have served, please let us know -- we are happy to make things right. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"The food is fantastic in this place, some of the best i have had. Love the slightly dated dark wooden decor, food was fast and really tasty. However, unfortunately the staff were pretty rude, so much so i didnt want to leave a tip... but obv did. And one lady in particular almost bit my head off for enquiring where the bathroom was. !!!! Could not believe how aggressive she was.  The toilet was not very nice or clean,,I'm glad you enjoyed the food, but so sorry to hear you didn't have good service. I will pass your feedback on to our team. I hope you will come back and that we can show you better service when you do. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"Small and bustling; we waited about 10minutes to get in, but it was worth it!
Helpful and accomodating staff. 
Try the unusual blossom tea:,Thanks for giving us a try! I'm so glad to hear it was worth the wait. Hope to see you again soon for some more great food and a blossom tea. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"Great little Chinese restaurant that came highly recommended.  The Nanking Sesame Chicken is a must.  Don’t hesitate to ask for suggestions as this is a restaurant that you can be confident in trying new things.,David, I'm so glad to hear you enjoyed the Nanking Sesame Chicken. Thanks for giving us a try, and I hope to see you again soon. All the best, Kathy, Manager."
"it has been a long time (12 years) since we found this gem and it is as good as I remember!  Friendly staff and I suggest relying on their recommendations...you won’t be sorry!  The best Sesame Chicken, won ton soup, fried calamari, and pork dumplings EVER! And the chef’s daughter is featured for winning Chopped on Food Network in 2016. So many good places to eat in China Town but seek this one out for a memorable meal.,It's great to hear your recent visit lived up to the great memories you have from dining here. I'm so glad the Sesame Chicken, won ton soup, fried calamari, and pork dumplings were all a hit for you. Come back again soon! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"Oh my gosh, best Chinese I've ever had in my life!! And they don't want you to order, so please don't try to.  They ask what you like and they keep it coming. We had beers with our entrees. They brought us chicken, shrimp, pork, beef, wontons etc and after a couple dishes came out they asked if we wanted more.  Which we couldn't fathom because we ate so much. If you are in San Francisco do yourself a favor and eat here!!,Katherine, it's an honor to hear we're the best Chinese food you've ever had in your life! I'm so glad you enjoyed the chicken, shrimp, pork, beef, and wontons. Please come back and see us again soon! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"The waitress was amazing. We didn't really know what to order. She said, ""Let me choose! I promise you will love it!"" She brought delicious pot stickers, and a tender beef dish with snow peas that we just loved. She was right! We did love it!,Carla, we love recommending dishes for people dining with us for the first time! It's great to hear you enjoyed the  pot stickers, and a tender beef dish with snow peas. I will be sure to pass your compliments on to our staff and kitchen. Hope to see you again soon! Kathy, Manager"
"My son (10yrs) and I went here recently for dinner. I have been before years ago and remembered how good it was. 
We were sat immediately, which was a surprise.. although at a table that needed to be wiped down. And someone came up to us right away which was great. The drinks and food we ordered came out incredibly fast but in no particular order. They were ""dropped"" on our table by a disinterested woman who was yelling at someone else in Chinese. This really didn't bother us, but if you're looking for great service, or someone to walk you through the menu, this is probably not the place. 
We weren't offered ice for the soda or a cold glass for the beer. The soup was lukewarm and the 'sizzling rice' had already been dumped in behind the kitchen. 
All this said, the food was just as good as I had remembered.,I'm glad you and your son enjoyed the food. If your food is ever too cold, or you are unhappy with it for any reason, please let us know, so we can make things right. I'm sorry you weren't pleased with the service, I will pass your feedback on to our servers. I hope you and your son will join us again soon. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"We stopped here as a party of two after wandering around Chinatown. This place came highly recommended by a friend. We were seated at a six top with another gentleman at the other end of the table. We ordered the onion cake and the tofu in black sauce. The onion cake was delicious, much bigger than we thought it would he. The tofu in brown sauce was mediocre until we added plenty of red pepper oil, then it was good. They serve soft drinks in the can and don’t do more than no frills service, despite charging for full service. It was good, but I’d like to check out Brandy Ho’s, around the block, for a comparable meal in a nicer atmosphere. Unfortunately their power was out when we stopped by.,Jenny_from_PA,

Kathy, Manager"
"After reading all the reviews we decided to go to this restaurant  had to wait about half hour for a table, place is super crowded , filthy, dirty tables, they served the drinks(beers and soda) hot ,no ice, portions are not big for a Chinese restaurant and when you add up , is not a good buy at all , food was average , nothing extraordinary , overpriced and overrated for sure.,I appreciate you giving us a try, but sorry you didn't have a good meal here. We are crowded because we have a lot of customers who love our food, and come back again and again. I wish you all the best. Kathy, Manager"
"Amazing! Delicious!
So good!
My favorite was the vegetarian egg rolls. Its not listed on their menu but
We asked and we got them, so amazing!,I am so glad to hear you enjoyed the vegetarian egg rolls! I will be sure to pass your feedback on to our staff. Hope to see you again soon! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"This is a casual, bustling spot with outstanding food. I’ve been going here for over thirty years and have never been disappointed.,Thanks for the great review! We're so glad your visits here are always good and the food never disappoints. Hope to see you again soon! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"I went there 20 years ago with my mother. I am going to San Francisco in 9 days and am going here for sure. One of the best chinese food resturants i have ever eaten!,Mark, thanks so much for remembering us, and putting us on your itinerary. We can't wait to have you back! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"Picked this place based on positive reviews and was not disappointed. There's no frills inside but the food was great. I also have to note that the service was very good and the staff were very knowledgeable about ingredients when I mentioned a food allergy. I definitely recommend if you're looking for somewhere in Chinatown to eat that can accommodate dietary restrictions!,Hi Emily, thanks so much for the sweet review. I'm thrilled that you enjoyed your meal, and felt well taken care of by the staff. We never mess around when it comes to food allergies, so I'm glad you felt safe here. Hope to see you again soon! Sincerely, Kathy, Manager"
"Dont let the cozy appliances fool you, this restaurant and its staff are excellent!  We ordered the jasmine tea, which were the largest I've ever seen!   Potstickers, scallops and a noodle dish.  All fresh and delicious.,Shelah thanks for visiting! I'm so glad you enjoyed the Jasmine tea, potsitckers, scallops and noodles. Please come back again soon! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"This small place was packed & for good reason.  The food was great & it was served fast.  Definitely want to eat there again when I return!,Thanks for the kind words. I'm glad you enjoyed your food and that you want to come back again. Hope to see you again soon! All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"We were on a Girls Trip and 9 of us headed to Nanking on a recommendation. I had no idea what to expect, but the line outside in the cold gave me the impression I was in for a treat. The ordering was a little complex - our waitress was hilarious and kept saying ""I'll bring you something you'll like""- but once we got the food it was absolutely delicious! I wish I knew what was in the House Noodles because I would pay good money to have them right now - I couldn't stop eating them. Everyone enjoyed their food, I just have no idea what the exact name of everything was - haha! Besides the noodles, I know I had fried dumplings that were wonderful. Thank you Nanking for a great meal! I wish I lived in California so I could go more often.,Lisa, thaks for this awesome review! I'm so glad you had a nice time with us, and enjoyed everything our staff sent to your table. Please come visit California again soon and dine with us again. All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"We went here on a recommendation 
Was seated straight away. Really struggled to decide what to order. Then we had someone ask us what we liked. Did we like shrimp. Chicken and beef. Did we like spice. Then said they will decide what we had. I did say I wanted pork dumplings. 
Out came the most amazing Chinese food it was really delicious!  Three amazing dishes with rice and the Delicious dumplings we struggled to finish it all. 
We had wine and jasmine tea as well and the bill came in at only $70!
I love this place. No thrills just beautiful Chinese food !  Would recommend it to anyone,Faye, thanks for giving us a shot! I'm so glad to hear our staff was able to make some recommendations that you loved. I appreciate your recommendation, and I hope to have you back again very soon. Sincerely, Kathy, Manager"
"Cited in many Guide Books, that relatively small restaurant is always packed. You just pass the door and they will greet you quickly with no ceremony and they hand you a one sheet menu in English and Mandarin. We only ordered Wonton soups, pork egg rolls and tea. The soup was ok, they egg rolls were bland. We should have tried the sesame chicken. Cost us 39$US.
NOTE that if your table can fit more than your party, they'll seat others with you.,Thanks for joining us and letting us know about your experience. We appreciate the feedback! We hope that you will come back for a chance for us to impress you more. 

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Found this place quite by accident and had a great meal at a reasonable price. Recommended. Really a hidden gem.,I'm so glad you found us, and that you enjoyed your meal here! Please come back and see us again. Sincerely, Kathy, Manager"
"We came here because we had heard Drake has been here so as a fan girl.. here we come! The place is jam packed! The line was out the door when we arrived but it moves very quickly!! **FYI, If your table can fit more than your party then they'll seat randoms with you. The food is decent for the price but the hype isn't worth it. I ordered dumplings and sesame chicken! In my opinion, it was quite filling but just ok!,We appreciate you giving us a try, but we're sorry to hear we didn't knock it out of the park. We do hope you will come back again and give us another chance to impress you. All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Our bus driver for our hop on / hop off tour of San Francisco recommended that we go to the House of Nanking. We were not disappointed. Fast service. Awesome food. We had the sesame chicken, steamed pork dumplings, and fried rice. All was so yummy. Definitely put this on your list of places to eat in San Francisco.,Jessica, we're so glad you gave us a try! It's great to hear that you had fast service and enjoyed the sesame chicken and pork dumplings. I hope you will be back to dine with us again whenever you're in town. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"The price is not low especially given how simple the settings are. However the food is really good and fresh. We even witnessed some of the staff cleaning green beans fresh from the market.

Tasty food, intresting recipes, some healthy options and a fair amount of choice. A good departure from the boring Mongolian Beef/General Tsao routne.
Well done!,Thanks for giving us a try. We always want to provide the freshest food possible, so we're glad you noticed! I'm so glad you enjoyed your meal and I hope you will be back to dine with us again soon. All the best, Kathy, Manager"

"This place is a great go to for lunch.  It's not a big place, but food is plentiful and tasty for a great price.  At lunchtime, there could be a line out the door, but we'll worth the wait.  If you go, definitely get the onion cakes.,Brucestravel, thanks so much for the 5-star review!

"Never mind the food just go for the experience.....we got a table straight away...got a beer and then while we were trying to work out the menus ( not entirely clear) we we’re asked by the ‘head lady’ what did we like? ie. you like fish? you like beef? And then after just nodding..she did the rest for us so we started with a yummy spring roll and then pork dumplings followed by sesame chicken...fried calamari...and beef ribs.
its buzzing it’s hectic and there are beer cases all over the place but the food is tasty and reasonably priced.,David, thanks for the kind review. I'm so glad to hear you liked the food recommended by our staff. Now that you know what we're all about, we hope you will be back soon for another great meal. All the best, Kathy, Manager"
"Loved it! We were lucky with the queue (no other pairs ahead of us, so we were in within 2 mins). Food was really good, fresh and tasty. Waiter kindly advised us to stop ordering when he thought we had enough (he was right). Great atmosphere too - buzzing. I can fully understand its popularity.,Steve, thanks so much for the 5-star review! We appreciate you taking the time to write about your experience. It's great to hear that you enjoyed the food and had great service. We look forward to having you back again soon. All the best, Kathy, Manager"

"Arrived at noon on Sunday.  The waiter was the worst we’ve encountered.  Ordered egg rolls and out came pot stickers. Main meal arrived (tower of noodles), but not our side of fried rice.  Second waiter asked if we wanted white rice.  Ha!  Then... finally the egg rolls arrived.   The egg rolls were amazing, could have passed on the rest.,AdventurousGirlie, we always want to provide a 5-star experience for you, so we're sorry to see something was off with your visit. We do hope you will come back again and give us another chance to impress you. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"I have never had a bad meal here. The food is fresh and perfectly prepared. Although there is usually a line, it moves quickly as the service is fast and efficient.

"The concierge at our hotel the Marker recommenced here and great he did 

The food was excellent  quickly prepared and good 

My only issue was we had just got our starters when the main meal arrived allowing us no time in between the two courses,We're so glad you went with your concierge's recommendation and decided to give us a try. It's great that you enjoyed your food, but I'm sorry to hear the pacing was off. We appreciate your feedback, and we will pass it on to the staff. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"While on a waitlist for a restaurant we passed by House of Nanking and decided to try it since we were hungry.

The ambience was nice, most tables are shared. The menu is simple. We had for starters veggie dumplings and fried Chinese eggplants.

For main chow mein, fried rice and sesame Nanking chicken.

Service was quick and taste was good. The restaurant won multiple accolades and visited by few famous individuals.

Enjoy if you are in the area.,Shadiabo, I'm so glad we were able to win you over while you were waiting!  It sounds like you sampled some of our best dishes, so I'm glad you enjoyed your meal. Hope to have you back again whenever you're in town. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"This chinese ""restaurant"" was recommended to me by a tour guide (not sure if they were tripping out at the time) When we arrived it looked quite small and dingy, with ladies running around in all directions clearing tables/serving food/shooing people in and out of the door. It was very busy which reassured us a little however, as we were a big group of 9 we had to wait (only a few minutes) and were seated very hastily. The next 45 minutes was quite the bizzarest dining experience of our lives...The 1 available toilet was dark and in what appeared to be doubling up as a stock/cleaning cupboard. We were then basically 'told' what to have to eat- which was pretty much a buffet selection of various items..some nice, some not so...it all came out very quickly which gave the impression that nothing was cooked freshly to order. There were no knives, only forks and when we asked for knives for everyone we were given 1 and told to 'share it' - unbelievable...the bill came and we paid in full however decided against leaving a gratuity as the whole experience had not been enjoyable - we'd felt uncomfortable and almost bullied. I explained my reasons for not leaving a tip which appeared not to be understood - the same lady had understood clearly prior to this...we then left and my son realised that he had left a bag behind. On returning he was told to look where we had been sitting and spoken to in the same demeanour however, he noticed his bag had been hidden under the till counter!  So now not only bullies, but thieves! 
Never go to this place if you'd like a nice relaxing meal - it ain't gonna happen here.,It seems like there were a lot of misunderstandings during your visit. We serve many people a day and our servers work at a very fast pace. Sometimes this tends to come off as rude, but I assure you that's never the intention. We never want our customers to feel bullied, it's actually one of our traditions here to recommend menu items to people who are there on their first visit, and to have our staff choose some meals we think you would like. We do this, because many customers are unfamiliar with our traditional Chinese food options, or intimidated to try something new. It is generally a big hit with our customers, and people often request that our servers do this again when they come back. You are never forced to do this, and we are always happy to bring you whatever you would like from the menu. I can assure you that your son's bag was not hidden, but whoever bussed the table placed it at the register. Whoever you asked about the bag, probably didn't realize the table had been bussed yet. I'm sorry you didn't have a good experience. You are always invited to come back and try again. Sincerely, Kathy, Manager."
"The service was top notch and the food was served ridiculously fast even though the place was packed. Very tasty food at reasonable prices.,We always want to provide top-notch service! Hope to have you back again soon for another great meal. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"I’ve been coming her when in town for over 25 years.  The food is excellent.  I saw a menu this time.  We had four dishes and shared.  I had the scallop tower, excellent, someone had the sesame chicken, perfect.  We had the black pepper shrimp was good and fried rice.   All in all it was another great meal!!!,Margaret, thanks so much for the great review. I'm so glad to hear you enjoyed the sesame chicken, scallop tower, and the black pepper shrimp. Hope you will come back soon for another great meal. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"We loved it here the food is all amazing and  very authentic. The hostess is orderly and keeps everyone in check 😉 and they look to get you in and out quickly. Good value very tasty food served with few frills,I'm so glad you had a nice time and enjoyed your meal. I'm glad you thought the food was tasty, and a good value. I do hope you will be back to see us again very soon. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"This one was a bit a lucky shot, we did not know where to go and choose this one. We did not regret it. This is a cool place, you just walk in, no ties, no chichi. We got a nice table and ordered two three dishes from the menu. We did not have to wait long and were served really delicious stuff. The chicken Nanking style was great but every single dish was great. The place itself is not very special but the service, the food and the price are worth a little detour.,I am so glad you found us and that you enjoyed your meal. We always want to be worth the detour. I do hope you will be back to see us again very soon. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"Went here after seeing good reviews here on Tripad. Funny place, and the ladyowner was very effective and shouted out orders high and low. Small place, packed with people. Ordered the famous nanking chicken, and everyone agreed that this was excellent food, tough the portions was enormous. Sharing is caring! You could easily share a platter with a friend and still be full.,Marianne, I'm so glad you stopped by, and that everyone enjoyed their meals. We never want anyone to leave hungry! I hope you will all be back again soon. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"I've been eating in this restaurant since 1997. Every time I swing by SF, it's a MUST GO.
Food quality and variety is good, price is adequate considering the place and the area.
Try to be there way earlier that your time expectations. After 8pm it's very crowded.,Bruno, thanks so much for the great review. We're so glad you have had some great times here since the 90's. Hope to have you back again soon! All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"It was our first time at this place and we didn’t know what to order. Our waiter asked if he could help and if anyone had any dietary requirements - we had 2 vegetarians in our family of 6. We were served absolutely AMAZING food - from the appetizers through the main course - the best we have experienced in any city. Fresh and unique pairings - try the flowering hot tea for a special surprise!

Love this place.,Elise, thanks so much for trusting our staff with the recommendations. We always know what you will love! I hope you and your whole family will be back soon. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"The food is great.  If you cannot make up your mind they will immediately suggest items.  This is not a place to leisurely enjoy a meal for hours.  It is a place to experience fantastic food in an hour or less.,RBreen, Thanks so much for your kind words, and for your business. I am so glad you enjoyed your meal and the suggestions made by the staff. I do hope you will be back to see us again very soon. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"We arrived here early on a Saturday evening to already find the place busy! We were seated promptly and ordered drinks. We then ordered food once we had decided which to pick on the menu. We had a few dishes between the 4 of us and all of them were delicious!!! The onion cake was unusual but soooo good! The house noodles were so simple but so tasty. My 9 month old devoured them!! The service is quick and the portions are huge. So glad we stoped by!,Arra13, We always want to provide prompt service and delicious food. Thanks so much for stopping by. We're glad everyone enjoyed the food, including the baby! We do hope you will be back to see us again very soon. All the best - House of Nanking"
"This place is busy. The servers move fast. There are community tables. There is an air of excitement from the diners and the ones queuing outside. The place is small and packed. Everyone is happy. Here comes more amazing food. It smells so good. 

This is where I take visitors to San Francisco for Chinese food and then wonder why I am missing out by not going more frequently.,I'm so glad to hear that we are the restaurant you bring friends to for Chinese food when they visit SF. We love the excitement, happiness, and the fast-paced environment at our restaurant, so we're glad you do too! We hope you will decide to join us more frequently yourself, stop by any time! All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"We were asked if we had been there before and once we answered no, they took our menus and they just started to bring out food. Everything was amazing and hot. And there was plenty of it. The eggroll things were fantastic!,I'm so glad to hear you had a wonderful first experience with us! Our staff is great at choosing the perfect dishes to show you what we're all about. I do hope you will be back again soon. All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"So glad this establishment is still an icon in San Francisco! We ate there in 1993 and it was just as amazing this time! The green onion pancake and steamed pork dumplings were fabulous 😬,Denise, we've been welcoming folks near and far to Wilma's Patio for over three decades now. It's so great to hear that you remembered us and that we lived up to those great memories all these years later. We hope you won't wait so long to visit us again -- come back soon! All the best - Kathy, Manager"
"One of our all time favourite dining experiences. I’m usually careful when ordering to try not to get overly fattening, deep fried dishes ... but when we come here the staff offer to select their own specials after seeking advice on what food to avoid. We love the lucky dip experience, they bring meals I wouldn’t otherwise try and I have never had anything we didn’t enjoy.
Might need an extra work out, but the meal is memorable and delicious! Always top of our San Francisco activities!,Thanks for trusting us to cook up some special dishes to meet your taste! We love having the freedom to share some of our favorites with you, and I'm so happy you enjoyed all you were served. We can't wait to see you again the next time you make your way out to San Francisco!

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"This was by far my favorite place to eat in all of San Francisco! Amazing flavorful food! The potstickers in the peanut sauce is to die for and my favorite to order! I also really enjoyed the pepper shrimp! I couldn’t stop eating it! I went back 3 times in my 5 day stay this trip because it was the best place! Anything I ordered was on point and cooked to perfection! Sometimes there’s a line to get in so get there early to get a seat but it’s definitely worth the wait! I stayed at the San Remo hotel which is a nice short walk to House of Nanking! I felt safe walking around and there’s a lot to see in that area!,We're honored to be considered your favorite out here in San Francisco! It's wonderful to know we were worth coming back to -- hopefully it got better with each visit. Whenever you're back in town, know we'll be here to welcome you in again.

Can't wait to see you then,
Kathy, Manager"
"We arrived here 15 minutes before the last orders so our experience was very rushed. Can’t fault the food at all, the sesame chicken and pork was amazing and I think for a first time in Chinatown, ordering several dishes is the best way to go as it meant we could try a range of food. 
The staff were somewhat abrupt however, the service was very fast, within 10 minutes of ordering. 
Overall a good experience, just wish we had more time to enjoy our food however this was our own fault.,Our team does tend to work fast -- we can assure you we never want you to feel rushed though! Hopefully in the future you'll stop back in and give us another chance to give you the time to sit around and enjoy all the flavors we're serving up. We'd even love to suggest some of our favorites for your to try the next time you're here!

Hope to see you again,
Kathy, Manager"
"So each time I come to SF I try to visit this restaurant.  This spot has never disappointed me. Just tell the owner that he has to choose for you, or as he says, “Trust me”
Just mention what you like or dislike and if you are allergic for something 
The result is truly exceptional,Glad to know we've always left you impressed! We definitely work hard to accommodate your taste and serve up dishes that will leave your taste buds pleased. Thank you for your kind words! We can't wait to see you back again soon.

Until then,
Kathy, Manager"
"My husband and I went here based on the suggestion of a foodie friend of mine. She told me she has been going here for 20 yrs. It was the best Chinese I have ever had!!! I especially loved the Sesame Chicken and the dumplings! I thought the prices were very reasonable. You don't go here for atmosphere or amazing servers ... it's all about the food. The place is a little hole in the wall in Chinatown. The servers aren't rude, but a little brusque. They move people in and out pretty quickly, but the upside is there isn't a long wait for the delicious food. I am only sad that I live in another state, so don't know when I will be back again.,Be sure to thank your friend for us -- we're honored to have been recommended! It's quite the compliment to hear we're made up the best Chinese dishes you've ever had, and we are so happy you enjoyed all that you tried. Though you may not live nearby, know that we'd love to welcome you back whenever you travel into town. 

Can't wait to see you again,
Kathy, Manager"
"The title says it all: if you are in Chinatown and looking for a great Chinese meal, I can definitely recommend this address: quick service and tasty food: the ""crackling beef"" we had was very well flavoured with amazing spices.,Glad our Crackling Beef could spice up your day! We really appreciate this wonderful review. Whenever you're looking for a tasty bite to eat out here in Chinatown, know that we'd love to welcome you in for more of our favorites again. 

See you around,

"Actually i came here with an advice, but i had doubts before i get in the door. We tried house fried rice with beed, house noodles and deep fried beef. All of them absolutely amazing. Even my daughter who doesnt eat at all, she finished her noodle. Great service with smiley faces. Even Keanu Reeves tried this place😆 i hope next time i see you keanu❣️,It's wonderful to hear that our flavors impressed even the taste of your daughter! Glad you all enjoyed your time dining here with us. Whenever you're back in town, know we'd love to have you come in and try more of what we have to offer.

Hope to see you soon,

"As an American I am used the the Chinese food at typical Chinese buffets...this is NOT that!  This is real Chinese food and the flavors are wonderful.  The staff can be a bit rude, but I am willing to take that abuse for food this good.,andrewhaucke, we're so glad that you can taste the authenticity and realness of our Chinese food flavor! We'll be sure to speak with our service team regarding your feedback, and we hope you make it back our way soon!

"This small restaurant was recommended by our BigBusTours guide. The food was quite fresh and good, the recipes were original, and the service was friendly and VERY fast. A very good find in a neighborhood that is full of Asian restaurants.,We're so glad you came by and gave us a try while you were in town! It's awesome that you were a fan of our unique, Chinese fusion flavors. Hope to have you back again whenever you're in the neighborhood.

"Over the years I’ve been to the House of Nanking many times (been my favourite place in SF) and recommended it to friends too. Had a meal there this past Saturday, which was not great! They weren’t busy, but seemed to rush us through our meal, which made everyone uncomfortable. Food not as good as in the past either. Will not be going back again!,After so many delicious meals here with us, it's a shame to know you let one off-day turn you away. Hopefully you will reconsider giving us another chance to satisfy your taste again. We'd love to serve you up our unique fusion flavors in the future. 

Take care,

"This little restaurant was excellent. Food is served family style so everyone gets a taste. Go early because there will be a line outside waiting to get in. Fresh flavorful cantonese food at its best.,Sabrina, we always work as fast as we can to get you through the line and make sure you don't have to wait too long before enjoying all of your favorite meals here with us. Thank you so much for this wonderful review! We're looking forward to serving you our delicious fusion flavors again in the future.

"An old friend brought eight of us to House of Nanking after telling us what to expect. He said you won't order anything apart from your beverages, they'll just bring food and more food. So it turned out to be like that and, oh, so much more! It was fun, loud, friendly, casual - you know - a family dinner. And DELICIOUS food and drink kept coming until we were all cheerfully STUFFED. Best in class - will definitely be back!,It's so wonderful to know you were left full and satisfied after your time here with us. Be sure to thank your friend for us -- we appreciate him bringing you our way! We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed your visit and were left impressed by your meal.

"Cant go wrong amazing fresh flavors, portions, preparations... Chef Peter Fang and his team took great care of us. We ordered a few select items off the menu and he finished our order with recommendations of his own. Our group of 6 ordered family style and were well pleased with the 7 course dinner that followed.  There are thousands of pictures posted here so i didnt bother to add any more and to be honest... the pics dont do any of this justice.  Just GO, ask for the chefs recommendations and enjoy. 

We devoured the:  Calamari, Crispy Beef, Honey Shrimp, Sesame Chickwn, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and others and it was all worth it and then some!!,I'm so happy to know the chef's suggestions satisfied your taste -- I'll be sure to pass on the compliment. We've worked hard to perfect our Chinese fusion flavors, and we're so thrilled to know it left you impressed. Hope your whole group enjoyed their time here with us! Whenever you're back in the area, know we'd love to have you stop by and grab a bite to eat with us again. 

Have a great day,

"Our kids LOVED their sesame chicken, it's their favorite meal from our californian roadtrip... and they are picky eaters!,I'm so glad our sesame chicken could please your little, picky eaters! Whenever your family is back in California again, know we'd love to have you stop in.

"Quintessential family-run restaurant on edge of Chinatown. 
We sit down. 
Hostess (owner?): you been here before?
Us: no
Owner: you hungry?
Us: yes
Owner: any food allergies?
Us: no
Owner:  ok. I take care of you 
(She takes our menus before we had opened them)
Out came an incredible family-style meal. Quickly! Vegetables tasted incredibly fresh. Dishes were very innovative, like apple chunks fried and mixed with sauce. 
My boss: what style of cuisine is this? Cantonese? Szechuan?
Owner’s husband:  our style

On the way out we noticed that not only do they not have freezers, they may not even have refrigerators. Vegetables were piled everywhere. 
Real farm to table!,It's so great to hear you were impressed by everything you tried! Over the years, we have gathered feedback from our guests and have used it to form our Chinese fusion flavor that influences our menu. I'm happy you were a big fan of our freshly prepared meals, and I hope we'll see you back our way whenever you're back in town. We have plenty more for you to try! 

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"Nothing fancy, but great food. One of the best Chinese food I had.
Uber driver recommended this place.,Thanks for listening to the recommendation of your driver! Happy to hear we left you impressed.

"Turned up just before 7pm (Sat night) & were seated straight away by friendly & not at all pushy staff. Order a selection from the menu & nothing disappointed - we had, amongst other dishes, the sesame chicken, scallop tower, wonton soup, crispy calamari & a pork dumpling dish with peanut sauce - all absolutely delicious. We didn't feel rushed though we were finished within an hour, however with teenagers who don't like to linger in restaurants, that was perfect!,Thank you for coming our way and letting us take care of you! So happy to know you were left fully satisfied by your whole meal here. Whenever you're looking to enjoy another delicious evening out on the town, be sure to head our way again. We'd love to feed you all of your favorites! 

Until then,

"If the owner comes to your table when you arrive and suggests he will put together a menu for you of his best food - beware! We ate at the Nanking last night and the owner gave us all the patter and flannel about his food and Jamie Oliver thinking it was “pukka” etc and the food he produced for us was bizarre. We told him we had two vegetarians who ate a little fish in our party of four but he just brought loads of meat dishes. We virtually had to plead for something vegetarian. My wife was really unhappy and we had to complain. My advice - choose directly off the menu. Don’t follow his lead.,Chris, thank you for reaching out. It's disappointing our special dishes didn't impress you, and if we misunderstood the type of food you were hoping to get. I can assure you we only had your best interests in mind, so I hope that came across. I also hope for another chance at showing you some delicious food! 

Until then, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Went there for dinner after on a Big Bus tour around the city and the restaurant was packed and cases of beer were everywhere, I felt like I was in a warehouse, while looking at the menu someone who appeared to be the owner come over and said he’ll
Take care of us. We thought this was a good thing but turned out not to be, we got maybe 5 small plates of moderately good food and the cost was almost $150 USD!! That’s outrageous! Don’t recommend unless u want to spend lots of money or at least don’t let him “take care” of you!,I'm sorry to hear about this experience you've described with us, Andrew. Typically, our guests love coming to see us for our delicious flavors that our dishes provide. Our recipes are Chinese fusion, and we feel that everything is priced fairly for what you get. Thanks for stopping in any way to see us! 

All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Our hotel recommended this place out of all the many restaurants in Chinatown.  When we arrived and were looking over the menu, the owner and head chef, Peter, came up and introduced himself to us and said ""Trust me, I will bring you dinner for 4; you don't need a menu.""  We were dubious but decided to be adventurous.  We were glad we did!  The 5 courses came with just the right timing between them and the food was out of this world!!!,Kudos on taking a few chances with your meal! We look forward to sharing more with you next time.

"I am not one to be intimidated by a hole in the wall.  I called and ask how bad of a wait it was on a Thursday night, come right down the woman said, no wait. Off we went excited for amazing Chinese food.
Our Lyft driver dropped us off, we walked in and were quickly shoved in a corner table that we shared with strangers. Cool, no big deal except no one helped us....for a while. Finally and older gentleman walks over with a note pad, stands there and doesn't say a word just stares me down. Ok then...I spit out an order afraid to even make any special requests or ask about the menu. He looked angry so I wasn't going to mess with that.
Wonton soup. Ok. Not what I am used to but it was tasty. 
Goyoza. Not what I'm used to. Thick and over cooked drowning in peanut sauce. I'd have expected for dipping not on them making them soggy.
There was no rhyme or reason to the order the food came out but our plan was to eat and get the hell out.
Out comes sesame chicken....the famous sesame chicken. A woman puts the plate down and goes ""rice"". I suppose that was a question so I said ""yes"". ""How many you need""
What???
I don't know just bring me some rice to go with my chicken but since my kids were basically eating the chicken I said 2.
It was mediocre at best. Nothing I'd rave about.
If I felt anyone would have talked to me about the menu I'd have been interested to try something new but again you felt like a bother to everyone in the place.
You couldn't pay me to go back. I realize tbere are different styles of Chinese cooking and this was probably one that was new to my family but with a little customet engagement we might have had a chance to enjoy this.
Menus were dirty and illegible in many spots.
Employees seemed angry and unapproachable.
I'm sorry but I do not get the hype of this destination. I'd never go back or recommend it to anyone.,Thank you for reaching out about your visit. We serve many people a day and our servers work at a very fast pace. Sometimes this tends to come off as rude, but I assure you that's never the intention. I hope you reconsider and give us another try in the future.

"Small but authentic.  Food was excellent, service quick.  Had the sweet and sour soup, Sesame chicken and salt & pepper shrimp.  Shouldn't have ordered any rice - more food than two could eat.,We're glad you loved your time here! Hope you ending up with some delicious leftovers from that meal. Hope to welcome you back for more soon.

"This used to be a decent restaurant to go to. It has now become the most mediocre Chinese restaurant. The service is poor, the attitude is rude and the food is downright inedible and expensive to boot. They make Panda Express look good. Save your money and go next door to the dumpling restaurant. Never again shall I go to this restaurant.,We're sorry you feel this way. If there's an issue with your flavors, please let us know so we can accommodate you. Thanks for giving us a try.

"Went based on the ratings, and they did not fail.  Nice little place, and as I have been to SF on several occasions, I never went to a Chinese restaurant.  For sure, I will do so again.

This place was nice, and had the absolute best dumplings I have ever tasted.  In fact, that would have been good enough for lunch.  Also had their signature dish.  It was good, not great, and is a good thing to have if you are sharing among others.  If I were to visit again solo, however, I would try something else.  

Definitely can endorse this place, and would be happy to find myself here again.  Lunch for one, without a drink, was $25 before tip.,Thanks for coming our way! We're glad you enjoyed our Chinese flavors. Sounds like everything went well for you. Hope to have you back for more soon!

"We went with another couple and was asked if this was our first visit. Since it was- the owner selected a delicious and well balance meal for us. We started with delicious veggie noodle egg rolls, honey beef, Nanking chicken, pork pot stickers and the biggest delight was Shrimp and Green Beans with delicious apples. Everything was cooked well, flavors were distinct and crisp, service was efficient and we all loved the experience. Would highly recommend and would also recommend to allow for chef’s choice. Price was very reasonable for each couple.,Thanks for coming our way! We're glad you enjoyed our Chinese flavors. Hope to see you back for more soon!

"The food was good but not polite and and had to work hard to get bill and pay in early afternoon on a weekday when they were not overly busy. Sesame chicken was great. Didn't really get what we ordered and it cost us... there are lots of grest places in chinatown and this was ok. Nothing special.,Thanks for coming by. We're glad you enjoyed our flavors. As for the service, we apologize that is wasn't what you deserved. We hope to have another chance to wow you in the future.

"I had visited here about 5 years ago and it was nice food, we had ordered for ourselves that time.  This time after waiting for an hour outside we were quickly shown to our table and the waiter came over, took our menus and said he would give us a treat.  We went with it and that was a big mistake.
Square spring roll, some pot stickers, sesame chicken (but bulked out with sliced potatoes) and a shrimp dish which was a total RIP OFF.  It looked like a pile of shrimps but in fact there were 3 shrimps and 15 pieces of apple meant to look like shrimp. 
We had a bowl of rice which had dried out so was hard and chewy and the chicken was also slightly cold.
I am assuming the ""Hey I'll bring you a selection"" is just a ruse to get rid of the dregs at the end of the night.
At $100 for the 3 of us we left here feeling as if we had just been totally rinsed, the food in my opinion was just below the standard of that at a Chinese eat all you like and it is a shame they see tourists as potential victims.
Wont be returning,We're sorry to hear you didn't have the experience you were hoping for. Let us know if there's an issue with your meal so we can accommodate you. We have many guests that enjoy our flavors, and we apologize they were't for you. Thanks for giving us a try.

"Great Chinese in China town-small place, crowded, shared a table but food was awesome!  Would definitely recommend and eat again.,We're glad you enjoy our Chinese flavors! Hope to see you back for more soon. -Kathy, Manager"
"This place came highly recommended to us . When we got there there was a lineup . 
Crowded . Noisy . We did not like the food much . Pot stickers had some sweet sauce that we did not like . None of the dishes we ordered were up to Vancouver standards . 
Price was very reasonable . Service was the usual rushed Chinese vibe and maybe a bit ruder than normal . 
We were disappointed ."
"So pleased our taxi driver told us about this place 😍 locals always know best. This place is phenomenal. The famous Nanking sesame chicken was to die for. So good in fact I'm looking at coming back one day all the way from England. Everything we ate here was amazing. No wonder they have been here for so long. The place is a food paradise. Best chinese food we have ever had. Thank you peter fang you legend,We're happy your driver told you about us too! It's great to know everything was delicious for you.

"We have been coming to House of Nanking for years and the food never disappoints. Peter, the owner, was on the premise when we first started going there 18 years ago, and he would wait on the customers.When we visited with large groups, we would have him order for us whatever was fresh...still do that but Peter is busy at his new restaurant...Fang's. The place is small, but has expanded over the years....but still small and usually with a line out the door. After dinner, you will continue to enjoy the flavors from your meal...usually sopping up the remains coated with delicious sauces.,Susan, thanks for all of your support from over the years! We're glad we never disappoint you. Come back for the food you love soon!

"We were a group of four, and we took the recommendation of the reviewers and articles that said it's best to let them ""feed you family style"".  Unfortunately, almost every dish was too mild spice-wise, and were on the sweet side.  We had a shrimp dish that had a sauce lathered on it, that was too sweet.  The dish would have been a lot better without it.  I suppose I should have stated our preferences, but we weren't asked, we took a leap of faith...  my fault...  The dishes did come out fast and were good/average, but not to our tastes, we just expected a bit more.,We're sorry to hear the dishes weren't quite what you were looking for. Always let us know, and we'll be happy to bring you something else. We hope to have another chance to deliver what you wanted in the future.

"Most incredible meal I've had in years! When we weren't sure what to order the waitress asked us if we had any food alergies (no) what we liked (everything).  She took our menues and said she would bring us 4 things we would like. UNBELIEVABLE!,What a great compliment! It's awesome to know you had such a delicious meal with us. Come back for more soon!

"With all the good reviews I specifically went to this restaurant for a late lunch. Ordered the sesame chicken with some rice and an iced black tea. The drink never came and they attempted to charge me for it, that was rectified quickly enough though. I cant really recommend the food, highly acidic and tasted very heavy, but also the food was cold after 2 minutes which made it harder to eat.

The service isn't very good either.

I'd leave it tbh.,Andy, we're sorry you didn't have the five-star experience you were hoping for. If there's an issue with your meal, please tell us so we can accommodate you. Hope to have another chance to make this up to you in the future.

"A group of 6 of us went here on recommendation from some local bay area residents. They suggested we not order from the menu but just tell the waitress to ""bring us food"". We were warned that we would have to look her in the eye and tell her to ""stop"" when we got full. Initially she put menus on the table but when we said we were told to just have her bring us food she quickly scooped up the menus and said, ""I'll be back"". She started bringing food for the table almost immediately! We had dumplings, short ribs, shrimp and rice, beef and broccoli, and several other dishes. We were stuffed by the time the 6th round came and we said, NO MORE. She smiled and said, OK that is all. The food was delicious and the experience was one our group will always remember. I saw other diners order off the menu and their food looked equally as good as ours. If you choose this route, which was great for 6 people, make sure you are hungry! Would definitely go back here next time I'm in San Francisco.,You can never go wrong with just a little bit of everything, right? Seriously, it was wonderful having you all in to see what we're all about here. We're always here for you when you're craving some of our cookin' in the future. See you next time!

Sesame seed chicken is to die for.

"Atmosphere, along with quality of food, is what make a restaurant.  The place is small but to us was expected knowing it was in a very old building.  It was nothing fancy but we went for the food.

When we sat down there were menus at the table and we, 4 of us, decided we we get different meals so we could split and try different things.  At this point an older gentleman came to the table, took the menus, and said that he was the Chef and would get us our food, and asked if we were eating family style.

We had an amazing meal of egg roll, crackling beef, steamed dumplings, steamed fish, sesame chicken and shrimp with apples and pineapple.

The only thing I didn't like was that we felt rushed in eating.  Everything came out very quickly, which is nice, but just a little to quickly to really enjoy.  Staff also seemed very rushed and because of this didn't seem very friendly.

Even with that being said I do feel would definitely come back again.,Thank you! So glad you love our food! Happy we could get you an incredible family style meal and we are so glad you loved the egg roll, crackling beef, steamed dumplings, steamed fish, sesame chicken and shrimp with apples and pineapple.

On top they added 15 % in tips making sure that I didn’t really understand it in the noisy room. As a foreigner I feel really tricked - I would never by my self have paid 15 % tips for a crappy experience like that!!!,Very sorry that you did not enjoy your meal.

"From the outside it does not look like much and the chairs and tables are wood and not fancy. You do not go here for the looks but for the food. You should get a reservation because they are very popular and come highly recommended. Order a number of dishes and share. The entrees are very large so two of them plus an order of rice might feed 4 people. I can recommend the mushroom shrimp. Service was very good as our food came out about 10 minutes after ordering it. This is a definite must visit in SF. Take an Uber as parking is not easy to find.,Thank you, Lance!

Service is abrupt, which can be overlooked, but the overall ambiance (if it can even be called that) is not even close to pleasant.  But the real lowlight is the food.

"Everything is WRONG with this place. First when we came there were so cold, and people where wearing their jackets or warm sweaters even the workers there! They used their windows like an extractor hood. Where a family asked them to close the windows they said no at first, but then after a while they closed some of them. The service was so bad. We got no time to decide to eat before the waiter came and were extremely onrushing. The food was not something speciel, not tasty at all. They misunderstood us because of their bad English skills, and me and my friend didn't get what we ordered. before we were done eating up the waiter came with our receives and out them on the table, again very onrushing. Then some minutes after the waiter comes back and just stood their waiting for her money. She stressed us so much, that we paid her too much, and we didn't want to pay tips (because of the bad service), but she stressed us so much about the paying and she got too much in tips. We just wanted to get out of this uncomfortable place... DO NOT ENTER THIS VERT BAD CHINESE RESTRAURANT!!,Very sorry that you did not enjoy your experience at our place.

We also ordered their famous Nanking fried sesame chicken which was ok. Since I love scallops, we ordered that along with their house noodles. Forgot to take a photo of the noodles. 
For the moderate prices and limited service, the food was not what we expected. A little too much acidity and too much sauce. We just wanted to try something different.,Thank you for trying out our place!

"This was my worst dining experience ever in many years of visiting SF and the USA

We were harassed into ordering a range of dishes which we had not had properly explained. The waitress refused or possibly did not have adequate English to answer questions about the dishes and what each contained. She snatched the menus off us before we had decided what we wanted. We sent one dish back as it was not what we ordered and appetisers came out after main dishes/entrees. The glass of wine my wife ordered was undrinkable so we sent that back.  We were not offered chopsticks as alternative to cutlery which would have been ok if they had given me a knife. 

The dumplings were actually ok but the beef was tough, the sesame chicken and the noodles tasted identical. The appalling service actually meant we couldn’t really appreciate the quality of the food. First time I have ever - in any country of the world- refused to pay a tip. This is definitely one to avoid,Very sorry, Keith, that you did not enjoy your dining experience with us. We are sorry that the Chef's choices were not to your liking and that our service was not up to our usual standard. We know we can get you a delicious meal and we hope you'll give us another try sometime.

"The short version - they sit you down, tell you what you should eat and charge you a fortune for it. And are rude about it on top. 

The long version - Once seated we were given menus that were abruptly taken off us and TOLD we should try a selection of food that would “really like”. We asked for some duck but were told “no duck!”
There then followed a selection of dishes ranging from noodles to sesame chicken to prawns with apple - all delivered abruptly to our group. As we were 2 families we had some kids with us who didn’t really like any of the dishes so we asked for some egg fried rice and chicken for them. 
The food was average - in total 8 fairly small dishes - and the bill came to $180!
We checked the bill and asked what the 2 “open items” at £14 each were - to be told it was the chicken and rice. 
Seriously how can a plate of chicken and a plate of rice cost the same???
To me it seems they just charge what they want. 
And to top it off, I was under the impression that tipping for service was optional? In most places I’ve been in the States it’s 10%, 15% or 20% yet here the 20% is lumped straight on your bill. When I questioned this the staff started arguing with me that it should be on there!

Avoid.,We are very sorry, John, if our chef's recommendations were not to your liking. We hope you understand that we do add a gratuity for parties of a certain size, as is a common practice at most restaurants. This is so we can support our hard-working staff.

"Arrived to see Jamie Oliver at the age if 25 glued to a wall beside our table.

A lady walks over and abruptly says ""What you want"" and we are gobsmacked but this was a Jamie's make over so it must be good.

After looking at the menu we order a number of dishes to share as well as a couple of glasses of red wine, and a glass of white.

We were again shocked to see the wine being poured from a goon bag (Aussie slang for cask wine)

The wine was delivered and we asked the lady to swap to a bottle of wine for the three of us to share and she says in her abrupt voice no I have already poured the wine.

The food comes out..

Salt and pepper squid.. very salty
Dumplings.. frozen and heated
Beef and veg.. full of that rubbish msg flavour
Salad... just ok

No taste in any food and all dishes were salty.
When we advised the lady of this, she did not care.

While eating dinner, we witnessed one kitchen staff member eating over the deep fryer.

The toilet... well that was a chemical storage unit with a basin and toilet that was smelly and dirty.

Jamie may have put this place on the map many years ago but they have gone down the shute. 

Never again!

Would never return.,Very sorry, Damian, if your recent meal was not up to our usual standards. As you can see from our other reviews, we are confident that we can get you a fresh and delicious meal.

This last month I took my visiting friends (from Chicago) there, there was not the usual line to get in, we were promptly seated, an elderly man took our order, we order sodas & were given a can of soda no glass no ice, I received my entree  (sesame chicken) it was flavorless, we also received the noodles, they were soggy. Entree's were served separately, a shouting argument ensued behind us about our order with staff regarding one last entree not served, the waitress just laughed when we looked her direction, the final entree was finally served it looked like it was hurriedly thrown together. No explanation given. I was embarrassed and my guests were disappointed. It has been taken off my list of restaurant list.,Very sorry, Robert, that your recent visit was not up to our standards.

The food was awful. Deep fried vegetable parcels ie square spring rolls. A big clump of fried rice. Beef that could’ve been previously dehydrated with spinach and a weird shrimp and apple dish.

"We were recommended here by our hotel when asking for the best places to eat in Chinatown, and even a week later we were all still talking about this place. We went on a Saturday night and arrived to find a queue out the door and decided to wait as we were intrigued as to why. Once we were in and seated we were “thrown” some menus and only minutes later had them taken back off us, asked what we liked and were told we were just being brought food...with no idea what.  We were all slightly in shock at this bizarre practice of service we could only laugh and we stayed out of interest, it turns out this only added to the overall experience of our night.  What we weren’t expecting was then dish after dish of the most amazing Chinese food we had all ever had to be served to us but having no idea what we were actually eating....the only thing we knew for sure was it had to be veg, chicken or beef.  We were in and out within an hour and we are still telling friends about it on our return home.

We were off to order our main courses, and because we were sharing, we had a bit hard time to find something which was suitable for everyone. Our waiter solved our problem and made the choices for us! We got meat,chicken,fish and vegan dishes to the table, rice and noodles on the side!

"We went on a Friday at 8:40 (they close at 9pm) and only waited 5 minutes. We were given menus but the waitress asked if it was our first time, it was, so she asked what meats/fish we liked and she would give a selection. Boy are we glad we agreed!

We had sesame chicken, a crackling prawn dish with apple (!) and a lovely succulent beef dish with rice. Really delicious fresh food, lots of veggies with the beef dish as great variety of dishes. We were expecting your classic mass produced touristy China town restaurant but this really exceeded our expectations. So much so we found it hard to decide which was our favourite dish.

Bill came out at $79 with three beers, which for the variety and freshness we thought was really great value for three people! Will definitely recommend!"
"If you want an authentic experience in the heart of Chinatown, this is the place!  You know when you walk in that this is the place the locals come.

"I can’t compare to others in the city, but I’ve eaten in chinatowns from Singapore, NYC, London, Manchester etc so have eaten in many across the world. I can’t stand greasy mass produced rubbish food pushed out for the tourists, so try and research to find where the locals eat. This came out highly, not interested in fine dining, decent fresh food at a good price. Seated without a wait and server came quick, offered to choose for us but declined as we know what we want. Ordered the famous sesame chick, green beans, rice and crispy beef. All came sporadic, so green beans first. Which I understand in tapas or a tasting menu but green beans alone ? Generally you want the rice and sides with the mains, not just one at a time. After 10 mins the other dishes came, very hot and tasty, can taste the fresh spices used. Chicken was by far the best but all are quite salty, nice hint of spice but not overpowering. Three fed for $54, which wasn’t bad at all. Don’t expect to linger about afterwards as people queue outside but we eat quick and like to be in and out. All to often its hard to get the attention of the servers wandering around. 
Overall fresh, clean and tasty, at a quick and reasonable price. 
Would come again.,Thank you, Suzie! So glad you loved the sesame chicken, green beans, rice, and crispy beef! We hope you'll be back for another wonderful meal soon!

"This was my second visit to House of Nanking, my first was 8 years ago with family, and this time it was myself and 4 friends. After a short wait we were ushered inside and I hoped our experience would be as good as I remembered. Although there might be a queue, there are lots of tables jammed in together, which means that you shouldn’t have to wait too long before getting a seat. House of Nanking might not be the most spacious dining, but this adds to the quirky atmosphere and fits in with the no frills theme of the restaurant.
Our experience this time exceeded my one from 8 years ago, after our server offered to bring us a selection of dishes rather than us ordering. I highly recommend doing this because it meant that we got to sample a range of different dishes that we might not have chosen otherwise. All of the food was fantastic, and I had so many favourites, but the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken stands out in my mind as a contender for the number 1 spot. Everything comes out when it’s ready, so you can enjoy a sharing meal with friends at a good pace. 
If you’re in San Francisco and you’re looking for a delicious meal, in a vibrant and casual setting, then make sure to visit House of Nanking.,Thank you, Kimberley! So glad you found your way back to our place for another delicious meal. We are thrilled that the sesame chicken was a standout dish for you and we hope you'll be back for another wonderful visit next time you are in the area!

"My grandson and I ate at this restaurant and loved it. If you are expecting something posh forget it. It is a place full of character with old style benches and chairs but very homely but of course the reason you're there is to eat. Try the hot and sour soup for starters one bowl is enough for two and is hot and delicious.For the mains we both had the house  speciality which was sesame chicken which was divine I could have eaten a second plate. This place is within easy walking distance of union square but is very popular so has a queue outside most nights and cannot be booked in advance. In conclusion if your are in SF you must try this restaurant.,Thank you! So glad you are such a fan of our place. Happy our hot and sour soup and sesame chicken impressed you so much! We hope you'll be back for another delicious meal next time you are in town!

"The food was really good! The staff was nice! The food was very quickly ready — it only took about 5 minutes or so after we ordered.

Happy we could help you feel so at home and we hope you'll be back for another delicious meal soon.

"We were recommended here by the concierge of our hotel for lunch.  We ordered several dishes and all were exceptionally good.  The restaurant has little atmosphere and the food came a bit too quickly after the soups were served, but all in all we loved it.,Thank you, Barry! So glad you loved the meal. We are thrilled that the soup and entrees impressed you and we hope you'll be back for another wonderful visit soon.

"We were only in SF for a couple of days. Really wanted to go to the Slanted Door, but couldn't get in. After perusing the reviews we chose House of Nanking. First let me tell you I have lived in LA and Honolulu, which both have some great Chinese food. I thought this was good, but not the best I've ever had. We arrived for lunch around 1:00. Got seated right away. Waiter appeared with menus almost immediately. We started with Potstickers and Pork Eggrolls. The Potstickers aren't really what I call Potstickers. They were deep fried all over and served with peanut sauce. The filling didn't have much flavor. The Eggrolls were better; layers of thin crispy wonton and the pork filling was really good. Next came the Hot and Sour Soup with Chicken. Excellent. We followed that with the famous Sesame Chicken and Fried Rice. The chicken was beautifully crisp and covered in a dark, flavorful sauce, but I thought it needed more garlic. The sweet potatoes on the side added nothing. The fried rice was blah. Should have ordered a vegetable or noodle instead. Service was swift and attentive, but don't expect them to stop and chat. Street parking is difficult to find in the area. We had to walk several blocks. There are parking lots around, but they were all full. I would go back to give it another try.,Thank you! So glad you found your way to our place! Glad the eggrolls impressed you so much, as well as the sesame chicken. We hope you'll be back to try some more of our delicious dishes soon!

"This was one of a handful of restaurants in San Francisco's famed Chinatown which was highly recommended to me. The ""back story"" to this one is that it began as a tiny ""hole in the wall"" place known mostly to locals but establishing a great reputation over the years, to the point that it greatly expanded in size. Today there is the main entrance and seating area plus a second large room behind. There are small tables plus long tables where groups - friends, families, whatever - were enjoying mountains of shared food, ""Chinese style"". I saw a lot of noodle dishes being consumed en masse but also more exotic dishes. They have both, on an extensive menu, which is pretty reasonable in price.

I got two familiar-sounding dishes to see how that would go: ""crackling beef"" ($14.95 entree) and an appetizer of ""fried shrimp packets with house peanut sauce"" ($6.95). This combo was plenty of food for a big guy very hungry from walking around the hills looking for this place - much easier when I ignored Siri, etc., which took me around in long hilly circles. I finally made it, and it's one of the restaurants open on the late side for Chinatown/SF. Very busy around 9 when I showed up. But quickly seated, no complaints with service (basic but sufficient, and as I say, they were quite busy.)

My dishes were both superb, I say as someone who has a spent a lifetime appreciating good Chinese food with good flavor, beyond the Americanized ""chow mein"", etc. (Note: I do believe they offer a few of these; it's a big menu which includes also whole sections of green salads and vegetable dishes.)

The ""shrimp packets"" were tasty on first bite, crunchy, thin, and covered with their flavorful but subtle peanut sauce and sesame seeds. I thought I was about to sample the equivalent of ""shrimp toast"" as is commonly served, but it was much better, with actual whole shrimp inside. The ""crackling beef"" - seen fairly often in NYC where I live, but often deep fried and indistinctive in flavor - was truly delicious and flavorful, with many ingredients (like tiger lily buds? Bokchoy?) mixed into the bountiful portion of beef. It was sort of zingy, not super-Szechuan hot, but right on point. 

So... I only ate a small sample of their offerings - though I saw and smelled many more, and saw/heard the smiles and ""ooh, yum""s all around me. What I got was exceptional and I'm certain I would have loved many of the other dishes. Definitely my go-to if/when I find myself back in San Francisco's Chinatown. Worth the effort to find and visit.,Thank you so much for trying us out! So glad the crackling beef and shrimp packets impressed you so much. happy our authentic flavors and unique dishes were a hit and we hope you'll visit us again next time you are in town!

"I have rarely written a negative review because I believe that the restaurant might just be having a bad day. However, I was very disappointed by my visit to this restaurant.
Service - was very bad. To begin with, we were served the wrong dish. What is worse is that we specifically mentioned that one of us had a shellfish allergy and they accidentally for us shrimp and mushrooms instead of salt and pepper mushrooms. After that, they made errors in the bill by billing us for extra items. That's just unacceptable. Anyway, we got the bill corrected and while we were paying, the senior manager came and stood at our table and said extremely loudly that the tip is USD 7 (13%). This was exactly the amount the corrected on the bill. I felt extremely uncomfortable with her hostile manner and we just paid, but I'm quite shocked that this is the standard of their service. 
Food - is just about average, but the pricing suggests that it would be tastier / more authentic. For instance, the sesame chicken is simply fried chicken pieces (like KFC chicken nuggets) thrown in a honey - soy sauce. There was no depth of flavours and no complexity to the dish. That is fine most of the time, except the dish is priced higher than the quality of food they're serving. 
Ambiance was nice with light streaming in from the big windows. This was one of the reasons we chose the restaurant actually, but I wouldn't recommend going here if you are only spending a day in Chinatown.,Very sorry, Niharika, if your recent visit was not up to our usual standard. We apologize for the confusion with your order and your bill. We assure you it will not happen again and we hope you'll give us another chance sometime.

"My husband and I love this restaurant!  I’ve been eating here since 1990, but I first introduced him in 2004 on our honeymoon.    We always look forward to coming back when we’re in SF as the food is amazing and served as you would expect- no frills and fast.  The flavors are traditional to Chinese food though light but still savory.  The fried tofu and crackling beef are delightful as is the calamari and shrimp pockets.,Thanks for the longtime support! I'm glad you enjoy everything from our fried tofu to our crackling beef. Hope to see you again soon.

Thanks again,

"This place was so delicious! I don’t know what exactly the chef gave us, but it was so good. My sister who lives in area took us there, and I’d have to say best Chinese I’ve had in a long time! I think we had sesame chicken, fried veggie cakes, fried rice, and some sort of creamy shrimp. I’d highly recommend. My sister says the line is very long on Fri and Sat nights and afternoons. My 5 kids loved it too.,From the sesame chicken to the shrimp, I'm happy to hear everything hit the spot, John! Thanks for the kind review. Hope to serve up some more tasty food for you soon!

"I don’t often take the time to write reviews, but I’m hoping to help keep someone else from making the same mistake we did.

We arrived at Nanking at about 7:00; it was small and crowded inside, and outside there were about 8 people waiting in front of us to get seated.  After a short wait we were seated and asked for four waters and four beers:  the water came in plastic cups with no ice, and was almost as warm as the beers.

We ordered Steamed Dumplings, eggrolls (which the waitress suggested we just get one order instead of two), some kind of fried dumpling, hot and sour soup, won ton soup, crispy beef and sesame chicken.  The beef was OK, as were the dumplings; the rest of the dishes ranged from mediocre to just plain bad.  The egg rolls were one of the just plain bad choices, and came with no sauces, even upon request, to redeem them.  

I’m sure there are dozens of good restaurants in Chinatown; I sure wish I had found one.,I'm disappointed you didn't enjoy our food more -- we are known for our Chinese fusion. That said, I hope you'll give us another try in the future.

"Restaurant serves very good Chinese food in a casual setting. Nothing fancy about the restaurant. Service is very quick. At times, you may feel rushed. Seating is close together. Restaurant is also on the loud side. During prime eating times, you may experience a wait. 

Favorite meals, pork fried rice (outstanding), potstickers, dumplings, sesame fried chicken. 

Definitely worth a visit if you don't mind a casual setting.,Thanks for joining us -- I'm glad you enjoyed everything from our pork fried rice to our sesame fried chicken. Hope to see you again soon.

"I visit San Francisco about once a year and make a point to go to the House of Nanking. 

From the outside it looks like a dive.  It’s a fast in and fast out restaurant.  And the food is amazing.

I have had many dishes although my favorite is the sesame chicken.  It’s delicious and unlike any other I’ve had during my travels.

Worth going out of your way to visit.,Thanks for visiting us whenever you're in San Francisco, Adam. I'm glad you enjoy our sesame chicken so much -- looking forward to the next time you make it back for more.

"Came here last night at the recommendation of our hotel, right around the corner in Chinatown.  Very crowded and shared seating, met new friends.  Waitress took our drink order, than an order gentleman came to take our food order.  He asked if it was our first time, and when we responded Yes he took the menus from us, pointed to his portrait on the wall, and asked us to trust him.  Ok.  Next came out 4 dishes of food!  2 varieties of dumplings, and a shrimp dish and beef dish, neither of which were on the regular menu.  Funny that everyone else at our table was also there for the first time, but didn't get the same treatment.  Told our story to the hotel staff, they told us that he has 3 restaurants and is rarely seen, so we had a special night for sure.,Glad you got such a special experience for your first time here with us, Tracie! Our unique dining experience and service makes for a memorable meal. Hope you'll visit us again next time you're in town.

"Having visited THON 15 years ago, we were nervous it would not live up to our memories but we needn’t have worried.  It has doubled in size but the unbelievably tasty food still resides at this less than salubrious setting.  Do not worry about the queues, the tight space, the sharing tables with other diners or the abrupt (while still somehow friendly) staff, simply enjoy the best tasting Chinese food in SF.  No need to recommend dishes, Everything tastes great.  We had our 19 yo and 16 yo with us who had heard us many a time reminiscing of this great restaurant.  Thankfully it lived up to our stories so much so that we went twice in a 4 night stay in SF.,I'm so glad your most recent meal lived up to your fond memories! I'm especially glad you were able to share the experience with your kids. Hopefully we made lifelong fans out of them as well! See you next time you're in town.

"Visited for lunch after walking tour of Chinatown ( recommendation of tour guide.) Service quick, friendly, helpful.  Suggest you do not order water.  It was not clear and no ice. Did not drink.  Others ordered tea, which had to be made with same water, but maybe boiled.  Both of us ordered pork dumplings which is an appetizer. Large servings, but taste just ok.  We shared entree of chicken fried rice which was wonderfully delicious. Saw and smelled Sesame chicken and something with broccoli which made my mouth water.  Would definitely order sesame chicken and more chicken fried rice were I to return. Heard someone remark Sesame chicken is their specialty. Many tables in small space, so did not wait long to be seated. Everything appeared clean.,So happy your tour guide sent you our way! You can't go wrong with any menu item, but sesame chicken is definitely a favorite. We really appreciate you giving us a try and hope we'll see you again next time you're in town.

"Truly the worst feed and service that I have ever experienced.  rude service and terrible dog food.  I would rather eat food left on the floor for a week than eat their slop.,Hate to see that you didn't enjoy your meal with us, Matt.

"I have lived in the Russian Hill/North Beach Area since 1989, and first went to House of Nanking in 1992, when I overheard the actor Matt Dillon raving about it on the film set for the movie Golden Gate.  In those days, it was a much smaller place and there was always a line out in front.  In general, I dislike waiting in lines, but we did, and had a pretty good meal, but nothing that motivated me to repeatedly stand in line.  Fast forward many years....The restaurant has expanded by taking over the space next door, and I suspect ownership has changed hands, either by sale or simply the changing of the guard.  Given it’s added capacity, the lines are not so much an issue.  The other day, out of curiosity, my wife (who is part-Chinese) and I decided to pay a visit.  I ordered the sizzling rice soup with much anticipation.  It was awful - way too salty, of tepid temperature, and came with a milky white broth.  The tofu dish we ordered was similarly horrible - tasted like it had been doused in vinegar.  The final dish was a honey-chicken that was yet another let down - also doused in vinegar.  On top of the culinary mediocrity, the service was the typical treatment one receives in a high volume high turnover restaurant primarily frequented by tourists.

In any event, we have no intention of ever eating here again.  It is a bad restaurant living off its past reputation.  Anyone who really knows Chinese food will give in thumbs down, but a lot of infrequent Chinese food eaters who do not know what good Chinese food tastes like might see the crowds, read the positive reviews, and convince themselves it’s exceptional because “everybody else says so.”

It’s the culinary equivalent of the Emperor has no clothes.  If you want a good meal in Chinatown, go to Yuet Lee on Broadway and Powell.,Our recipes are Chinese fusion dishes, so they are created based on the history of the restaurant and requests from customers. They are not necessarily traditional Chinese dishes. Many people really love our food and we are busy for a reason. Sorry the food wasn't to your individual taste, but we stand behind our recipes.

"We ordered several appetizer's and a meal to share as we wanted to try several things. We felt the food was really good and the service was pretty quick. I forgot to take pix but we had the Potstickers, Fried Shrimpackets, and the fried pork eggrolls. I wasn't a fan of the eggrolls but my husband loved them. Everything else was very tasty. The meal we ordered was the scallops--it was only 3 scallops but again tasty. For the amount of food we got, it was pricey.,I'm glad you enjoyed your meal here! Thanks for coming in. All of our dishes are made with high quality ingredients, so we feel that they are an excellent value. We would love to see you again sometime!

"If you like Chinese food, this is in the top two I’ve ever had. I travel a lot for work and have dined in more Chinese restaurants that I can remember, this was incredible.

The sesame chicken was lovely. Excellent portions, worth a visit!,Helenka, I'm glad you enjoyed your meal here!

"Visited here today with my parents visiting from out of town. I have dined here several times before but will not return. The food is average, but the rudeness of staff unnecessary. We ordered several dishes, and had to remind our waiter twice for the final dish. When finally brought out after we had already finished our other dishes it was the wrong order. We told her this was incorrect but she refused to listen and yelled at us. She was resistant before we got into the conversation telling us we were wrong. 

There are many other eateries in this location and I suggest future diners consider other places where they are appreciated and not treated so poorly. 

Just mean.,Eric, we serve many people a day, and our servers work at a very fast pace. Sometimes this tends to come off as rude, but I assure you that's never the intention. I hope you reconsider and give us another try in the future.

"Arrived and had a table immediately. We knew what we wanted but when the waitress took our order she asked “have you been here before”? No we replied, then leave it to me. We told her what we would have ordered and that’s what we got, plus some deep fried veggie pastry thing, which was nice.

Food was good, not great but not terrible! 

Asked for the bill and went to pay by credit card and that’s when the fun started. You have PIN go there she says. So I insert my card and she won’t let me see the amount or keys to enter PIN, what’s your number she shouts at me!! Eventually she gave me the pad so I could do what I needed but I did not add a tip as was gonna leave in cash and then she berates me for not adding a tip, so my tip, was do t be so rude!! She was not happy and there you go.

Ok/ average food with rude cashier = no tip!!,Thank you! So glad we could seat you quickly and pick out some fresh and tasty dishes soon. We apologize for the confusion with the card -- we did not mean to come across as rude in any way.  we hope you'll dine with us again sometime.

"We gathered with our siblings from all over the US in San Francisco. The weekend turned out to be a food tour that did not disappoint. Top of our list was Chinatown and with the high reviews for Nanking, we thought we would give it a try. When there is a line out of the door waiting to get in, you know you found the right place. The founder and chef took one look at our party of 8 and passed out beers immediately. He asked if we had ever been there before. We said no so he shook his head, took back up all the menus and said, ""Watch, I'll take care of you. I'm the chef."" He proceeded to bring us plate after plate of the best selection of his food offerings served family style so that we could all try. We were amazed at how fast the service, how perfectly representative the food and sufficiently stuffed and happy we all were. It was brilliant. This is precisely what the best of food experiences are made up of. Don't miss out. Be intrepid and adventurous. And ask the chef to bring you what he thinks you should eat!,Thank you!

"I wanted to try this place as it is well known and seems to be recommended.  Good atmosphere, busy, a bit squashy, service reasonable, but food is poor.  I had the famous sesame chicken and it was deep fried  bits of chicken, not sure what part, with a sweet sauce smothered over it.  Partner had beef it was also covered with sweet sauce.   Probably unhealthy options but we could not find anything on menu that didn't have heaps of sauce.,Very sorry that you did not enjoy your meal. It sounds like the sesame chicken you had was not up to our usual standard. We know we can do better and we hope you'll give us another try sometime.

I also had the house noodles with veggies and the veggie dumplings.  All were tasty and quickly prepared and served. The wait is not long and the prices are reasonable.

"Raw chicken was served to my 10 year old daughter!! They forgot to serve her when they brought everything else to the table. We asked about it and were answered very rudely. They brought her chicken after the rest of us were finished eating. She took one bite and then my husband was helping her cut the next piece when he released it was uncooked. The outside was barely cooked and the inside completely raw!!  Then they yelled at us to pay for it. They were so rude!!,Very sorry, Christi, that your daughter had this experience. We assure you this is not at all typical of a meal at our place. We assure you that this will not happen again and we hope you'll give our place another chance sometime.

"This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel.  The place was nothing special but the lady who sat us asked if we had eaten there before and I said no.  She said she would order 3 dishes for us and that we could share.  The food was fantastic.  It had been a long time since I had Chinese food that good and for San Francisco the prices were reasonable.  I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for great Chinese food.,Thank you! So glad you love our place! We are thrilled you found your way to our place and that you had such a special experience. We hope you'll be back for another amazing meal next time you are in town!

"We planned on visiting the establishment next door but it was dead and this place was hopping so we thought we would try it. Should have gambled with our first choice. We had potstickers that were greasy and heavy, fried calamari that were very greasy and undercooked to the point they were mushy, and house noodles with vegetables that was grey in appearance and noodles were cooked so much it was more like baby food. Service was quick with very little interaction, nobody ever checked in to see how the meal was and when it came time for the bill I had to hunt someone down. Establishment looked dirty. Don’t let the flashy sign suck you in, I’ve had better street food in Thailand for way cheaper.,Very sorry that you did not enjoy the food you tried. We apologize that the potstickers, calamari, and noodles were not up to our usual standard. We know we can do better and get you some fresh and delicious food. We hope you'll consider giving us another chance sometime.

"They don't muck about here, in the door and seated in seconds. The hostess/owner? asks what you'd like to drink and eat before telling you what she'll get and disappearing in the direction of the kitchen. 
Minutes later piping hot sesame chicken, prawns and rice with two cold Tsingtao beers arrive. This is great basic tasty grub in a local setting that won't break the bank and there's a nice atmosphere.,Thank you! So glad we can always get you a quick and delicious meal.

"We live in Vancouver so I'm a bit snobby when it comes to Chinese food. I was unexpectedly impressed with the food here! The chili wontons tasted like the meat was ground up and wrapped in house. The chow mein noodles definitely tasted homemade/cut. The stir fried pea shoots were garlicky and delicious. Best of all, the prices were all reasonable. I'll be coming back if we're in San Francisco again!,I'm thrilled we went above and beyond your expectations, Vinniey! It sounds like you got a great sampliest of some tasty plates here. It's a shame we're not closer to home for you, but we'd love to welcome you back the next time you're in San Francisco.

"You get a menu with appetizers, entrees, etc. But no main dishes. For the mains, they will just create something. You can specify if there's something you don't want, of course.

They served great food and were very friendly. 

We were lucky to be early, because afterwards there was a long queue on the street.,I'm so glad our Asian food was a major hit to you! It's great to know you enjoyed our unique dining experience. Thanks a million for the support, and I hope you make it back our way again soon.

"Was told about House of Nanking by the friendly staff at Stanford Court Hotel. 
What a place - staff are direct but food is awesome. Worth the walk if your in the area. The atmosphere is great, very close, very friendly. Travelling for work always find a new person to strike up a conversation.,I'm glad you could stop in while you were visiting San Francisco! You can always count on a tasty bite and a friendly face to talk to while you enjoy it. Hope we can look forward to welcoming you back again soon.

"We were in town for a conference and one of our colleagues knew the place and said it was very good. We all agreed to try it out and I have to say I agree. The owner/chef greeted us and suggested that he take care of our group of 8. Brought out multiple different dishes which were great. Dumplings, chicken, shrimps, calamari, rice, etc... etc.. it was all great. We could have ate more but we got there late and the place was closing up.  Would definitely suggest others to go there.  (Plus he said he liked our hometown Montreal, so good guy in our books :),It was a pleasure hosting you and your colleagues while you were in town, and I'm thrilled you all loved meeting our chef. Thanks for sharing our dumplings, calamari, and more were all delicious. I can't wait to welcome you all back if you're ever in San Francisco again!

"We arrived on a 3:40 pm flight from the east coast. We were tried and VERY hungry. We had a mission; to find the best Chinese food in Chinatown. I can’t say we did but I can say it was very good. We sat down and were asked if it was our first time to the House of Nanking. Once we affirming we were both first timers and very hungry the lady took our menus and said she would take care of us. She took our drink orders and within moments the food started arriving and just kept coming. 
The flavors were unique to any Chinese food I have ever had. It was Amazing. In particular I enjoyed the asparagus and bok choy.  I believe the bok choy was marinated in lemon grass but am not 100% sure. The Apple shrimp; mmmm mmm good!!! We also had the fruit and flower tea. I really like the flower tea. The setting was very noisy and a bit close. Service was fast. It isn’t a place that you will sit and relax once you have finished. We had 3 appetizers and 4 entrees and a plate of steamed white rice. Our bill was $106. We did not leave hungry.,Thank you, Dana! So glad you had such a wonderful meal at our place! We are thrilled the unique flavors impressed you so much and that everything from the bok choy and the shrimp. We hope you'll be back for another incredible meal soon!

"Got there right before closing and the waitress asked us,”are you a little hungry, medium hungry, or really hungry?” We went for medium, she took the menus, and left... we chuckled but heard to just trust what they brought for food... and we weren’t disappointed.  Fabulous variety of foods... shrimp, apples, rice, fried dish, beef, etc. yes, the atmosphere is chaos but it’s part of the gig it appears. Loved it!,Thank you! So glad you love the food. We are thrilled we could surprise you with some amazing dishes and that all of the flavors were on point. We hope you'll be back for more soon!

"What a great unique experience! From the outside this is a very unassuming spot, but from the minute I walked in the door, right up until I left I had a great time. We had seven of us here tonight, they sat us right away, gave us menus then took them away telling us they know what we like. From there it was a barrage of plates with all kinds of foods and flavors. Our drinks would not empty and the staff is a riot! This is a must experience while in the city, I will return.,Thank you, Kevin! So glad you love our place! We are thrilled the food hit the spot and that we exceeded your expectations!

"The House of Nanking was an interesting visit. We went into china town looking to get a nice “Chinese experience” but we did not get one to say the least. 

The man who was our server couldn’t have been worse if he had tired. Slamming the food down on the table to the point where the food almost all jumped out. Speaking of the food the chicken in the honey sauce was extremely nice. But watch out for the portions. If you are trying to order things to pick and choose from in your party don’t get loads. The fried rice could feed half Africa so to speak. 

Food was good, Service was not.,Very sorry, Archie, that our unique service was not what you were expecting. We are glad you enjoyed the chicken in honey sauce and big portions. We hope you'll give our place another try sometime.

"This place used to be our go-to Chinese whenever we visited San Francisco. Food was very good and cheap to boot. After this last visit, well, it will be our last. The pork ""chops"" for $14 consisted of four paper-thin pieces of a pork chop that were sliced like lunch meat on a deli cutter. The pea shoots, which we always loved, were a pile of stems. This is a cash-only place that is in many guide books or I wouldn't bother to warn people away. Something has changed!,Very sorry that your recent visit was not up to our usual standard. It is upsetting that it only took one off visit to ruin so many years of great experiences. We have not changed our menu, and we are confident we can get you the same delicious meal you expect from us. We hope you'll give us another chance next time you are in town.

"Remember you are a Brit. You like Chinese food... but you’re not the size of an average American - or even a less an average American !

The waiter will keep ‘anything else, anything else ..,’ and you’ll keep going ! 
They do it a lot. In a lot of restaurants 

Having said the garlic fried fish was excellent- like a sort of fried cod from your local chippie with garlic - 

All in really nice, but Chinese waiters were  back of the the queue when it came to charisma qualities,Thank you, Matt! So glad we could get you some much delicious food -- especially the garlic fried fish! We hope you'll be back to try some more tasty dishes next time you are on this side of the pond!

"This is a must if you are in Chinatown.  The owner rushes you through door  and you sit at tables made for eight.  If the chairs are not filled, expect another family to be sitting next to you. 
The melt in your mouth calamari and the house noodles are two dishes that I recommend.  The food is great but served to your table as it is made.  Everyone at your table will get their food at a different time and it tastes good HOT so you are not going to want to wait for others to get their food.,Thank you! So glad you love our place!

We had sesame chicken and the scallop towers they were amazing and the veggies that came with were spectacular. When my scallops came out I was initially concerned that I would  still be hungry but the watercress and cabbage salad that came with it was just awesome and I left very satisfied.

Seating is family style and we met a very nice couple from Portland who had also found Nanking on TripAdvisor.  The food was excellent.  The service was a little brusque, but not offensive.  We had the Sesame Chicken, Salt & Pepper Squid and Fried Rice.   It was all delicious.  We will return here when we visit San Francisco in the future.  Afterwards, we had a short, level walk back to downtown and our hotel near Union Square.,Thank you! So glad you had an amazing meal!

"I want to continue to love this place, and visit this place, and enjoy the food in this place. The Sentinel Building across the street is such a wonderful view. The waitress continues to work here, a constant, since my first visit too many years ago, now. So abrupt, yet, so direct... Anyhow, Maybe, I should maintain the unwritten program, specify the main, and allow them to concoct the dish. I made the mistake of just ordering the sesame chicken, and I was less than satisfied on this visit. The concoction didn't quite work. While the chicken was mostly still well prepared, the sweet potatoes were not good - maybe they were not properly in season, I don't know. I just wasn't pleased with the overall. The taste of the sauce was still spot on, as was the rice, and the black iced tea. I will return, like a Canadian Goose returns to Canada each Spring. And next time, I'll go with their advice. And their stand-offishness delightful chinese well-prepared delicious food. I look forward to it. Cheers!,Thank you for supporting our place.

"Highly recommended as a great value option in Chinatown.  Strangely, by default, they don't offer you chopsticks for meals and had finished meal with cutlery before realising you had to ask for the preferred option of chopsticks (nearby diners also using cutlery).  Very busy and there's a desire to turn the seating over as quickly as possible.  This is understandable for a cheap-and-cheerful Chinese but knocks off a star.,Thank you, Chris!

"The House of Nanking has been there as long as I can remember, but this was my first visit. There are many other restaurants on that stretch of Kearny, including Buddhist vegetarian place, which is where we were headed until we found out that it closes mid afternoon for a few hours. So HoN was our default option. It’s fun, colourful, busy without being crazy. The service is “old school,” which means brusque, even grumpy, and a bit hard to comprehend. Having recently been to China I think the cooking is closer to Chinese American than to Chinese. But the food was good, portions were ample, and the Chrysanthemum Tea was wonderful (as a show if not as a taste sensation). All in all HoN is not going to disappoint, but you won’t remember it either.,Thank you, Andrew! So glad you finally made it to our place.

"I have fond memories of the House of Nanking from a visit to San Francisco as a pre-teen.  This time, however, my hopes of a repeat experience were dashed.  Servers were rushed, and we were put at a table with others even though there were other empty tables (ok, this may be my cultural bias coming out). My partner's water had a fly in it (again, these things happen, not the end of the world).  But the food - we ordered sesame chicken and the ___ bao wrap (can't remember the name now).  The wrap came with what appeared to be flour tortillas just sitting on top of the dish, cold.  The menu made it sound like the contents would be actually wrapped inside.  Either way, neither dish left us impressed.  The flavors were mediocre at best.  I know this place gets good reviews, so perhaps it was an off night for us?,Thank you! So glad our place is filled with wonderful memories. It sounds like we dropped the ball on your recent visit and we apologize that we missed the mark.

The wan-tan soup was something very special : The soup was in a milk-like sauce with pop-rice with a special tasted herb in it., besides there was a typical wan-tan, it smelled good.

The meat and vegetables dishes was a disappointment. fast-food style. 

The service? horrible, fits they wanted to serve the meat and at the end  the soup!! American-Style?,Thanks for trying out our place!

"Found this gem by mistake, we were trying to get in a few doors down for noodles but there was no where to sit.  We were able to find a seat at House of Nanking, there is shared seating and we are fine with this.  

We ordered way too much good but felt lucky to have some left overs.  
Service was on point, quick, accommodating and friendly.  
We ordered pork eggrolls and stuffed pork mushrooms (BOTH AMAZING) to start and then Beef Noodles, rice and Spicy Chicken.  SO SO GOOD!!!  I can't say enough about this eatery.  We will go back during future visits to SFO and china town. 

I did not experience the wait staff as rude but rather focused on wanting to provide accommodating efficient service. 

Patrons were of all nationalities but it impressed me that there were many Chinese patrons. 

THANK YOU!!!,Deana, we're delighted you found our place by chance! Thanks for stopping by and trying out so many of our menu items. The pork egg rolls and stuffed pork mushrooms are excellent choices. Our staff's main priority is making sure every one receives the delicious plates they ordered in a timely manner so I sincerely appreciate your understanding. The next time you're in San Francisco, I hope we'll get another chance to serve you!

"as usual, staff are not the friendliest, but the food is outstanding.
for some reason they always want to seat me in a lonely corner - possibly because i am alone?  sorry , i don't want to sit in a corner by myself.
other than the service, i would definitely recommend this restaurant! been eating there for over a decade, and keep returning,Your more than ten years of patronage is a huge compliment -- thank you so much for trusting us for delicious Chinese food!

"My husband and I came in for lunch to find it semi empty. People say the wait staff are rude but it's a cultural thing. We didn't mind it at all. We both ordered hot tea with goji berry and fried eggplant to start with. Then we both ordered spicy dishes, one with chicken and green beans, the other with black bean sauce. They were all so good that we finished all of our dishes. The price wasn't too bad for the both of us and the wait wasn't long at all. They do stop by to see if your dish is done so they can take it in to clear your table. We loved the food and we'd come back if ever in the area.,Jackie, thank you so much for dining with us for lunch! I'm delighted to read you enjoyed the hot tea and fried eggplant.

"Im not a big fan of Chinese Cuisine but my Husband adores it, so staying on the edge of China Town it seemed churlish not to go there for dinner. I really enjoyed the food and experience at House of Nanking, it was like a meal we had in Shanghai. The place was full of Chinese families and business men alike - always a goos sign. Agreed Its not a 5  star gourmet venue, but was clean and efficient and  but the food is really delicious. The staff were thoughtful and welcoming, e.g.  a warm guide to our chosen seats and tailoring the Wanton Soup to suit my tastes ( the result was delicious) so I dont understand the others comments about service. It was fast and to the point, but that was the type of place this is. If you want 5*..... find an international hotel and eat a middle of the road westernised version of a meal. The portions are huge here so choose wisely if you dont want to waste food! I highly recommend this restaurant and would not hesitate to return.,Marina and Stuart, we're so delighted you two stopped by during your stay in San Francisco! It's wonderful to read you enjoyed our welcoming service, wanton soup, and authentic experience. Your recommendation is a huge compliment to our hard working staff, so I just wanted to express my appreciation for your kind words! Wishing you the best.

"The menu at this place wasn’t that great. I ordered the house noodle which they stated was a thing noodle i was expecting a noddle similar to the Singapore mei fun which is what i truly wanted but they didn’t have it on their menu, what i received was a small version of an egg noodle. The noodles were dry and very heavy tasting. The shrimp cake was good i liked the peanut sauce. The best thing they have here is the tea!! Omg the tea is soooo good!! My seasame chicken was waaayy to crunchy almost burnt,Thanks for visiting us! Our menu can be more authentic than some of our guests expect, so I appreciate you trying out so many great dishes. I'm sorry the sesame chicken wasn't to your liking, but I'm delighted you enjoyed the shrimp cake and the tea.

"Aer Lingus crew member recommended this casual, busy chinese restaurant in the heart of San Francisco. We ordered a large selection of food (6 of us eating) all of which were delicious, not one of the dishes was a nahhhh or even an ok, they were all beautiful. My wine snob husband was delighted by the quality of the house pinot noir and the price was great value for everything. Would make a point of going back if I get back to San Fran.,Pauline, thank you so much for visiting us on the recommendation of an Aer Lingus crew member! That's one of the most unique word-of-mouth recommendations we've ever heard. We're delighted you enjoyed all of the dishes and that your husband was impressed by our house pinot noir! We can't wait until you visit San Francisco again. 

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"We arrived about 6:00. It looked very old inside, not clean. The guy gave us a menu, nothing jumped out to us. ""Wha you want?"" after less than a minute or so... the only thing we saw was chow mein. We decided to leave and find another place for dinner. We do not recommend this place.,I'm disappointed nothing on our menu really jumped out at you, Watson! Our Chinese fusion is based on a history of the restaurant and requests from our customers, so we hope we'll get another chance to serve you in the new year. I'd recommend checking out our menu online! We're always happy to answer any questions you may have.

"Nanking came highly recommended by the food Network & Yelp. There was a line outside, but it move quickly. I had a cold so was planning to order Hot & Sour soup. I can’t express how delighted I was with their recipe. This was not the typical mostly broth & a few vegetables soup. It was packed generously with delicious veges & tender chicken pieces. The heat from the chili flavors was just what I needed. We also loved their signature chicken dish, fried rice & eggplant & sweet potatoes. Even my husband ‘s won ton soup had beautiful presentation. All very hearty & generous. The only thing missing was the traditional fortune cookie. <sigh> Not a deal breaker & will return again soon.,We're so pleased to read you visited on the recommendations of the Food Network and Yelp! On a chilly day, nothing warms you up more like an authentic and hearty hot and sour soup. It's wonderful you enjoyed the chicken, fried rice, and eggplant, too! Believe it or not, fortune cookies are actually an American creation, but we'll definitely keep your feedback in mind. Wishing you a wonderful new year!

"I used to come to H of N when I lived in SF twenty-something years ago. I live in Dallas now where good Chinese food is almost impossible to come by, so when my husband and I went to SF this week without the kids I promised him we’d eat Chinese every day. I’d raved about H of N, the restaurant of my youth (:D), so we went there as soon as we arrived in the city and ended up returning for lunch the next two days. We tried something different every day. Nothing was bad, everything was absolutely delicious! The only thing I missed was shrimp and asparagus in black bean sauce, as no asparagus was available. You don’t come here to be coddled—you come here to eat great Chinese food! Already looking forward to our next visit to SF and H of N!,Marisa, welcome back to House of Nanking! We're thrilled to have you back in the neighborhood, and we're very impressed you tried something new both days you stopped by. I wish we had the asparagus available when you visited, but I'm happy you enjoyed everything you tried. Looking forward to your next trip to San Francisco! Have a great 2018.

"Tables turn quickly, so don't be intimidated by the line out the door. . . just know that you're another number, so don't get bent out of shape with the rushed service. Soups are great - Hot & Sour was very spicy, but not to be missed, as well as the Steamed Dumplings.  Sesame Chicken was average (almost twice-fried), as were the Fried Shrimpackets and Sesame Noodles (over-cooked). MY PERCEPTION is that while everything is ""made to order,"" it's already in the fryer or skillet before your order it.  Maybe a late seating will improve your experience.,Thank you so much for dining with us! The Hot and Sour Soup and Steamed Dumplings are perfect introductions to our menu, but I wish we impressed you more with the shrimp and noodles. We serve many people throughout the day, so it's our goal to get everyone the dishes they ordered in a timely manner. Hope we'll get another chance in the new year to serve you!

"Buzzing atmosphere, lively chatter- it momentarily distracted us from the fact that we had to wait outside in the freezing cold for almost 45 minutes. As soon as we sat down, we were greeted by a grumpy waitress, who shouted at us to quickly order some dishes. Our food arrived shortly- we had ordered salt & pepper squid, house noodles and sesame chicken. However, the squid was stale and too sour, and the house noodles were plain and flavourless. Our cups were also not washed properly, as I found a lipstick stain on mine. 

We soon left feeling unsatisfied, and had to find another place to eat. 

All in all, I think that it was a disappointing experience. The service was rushed, and the food did not meet our expectations. However, I do have to admit that our food was delivered very quickly.,Mai, thank you for coming by. We serve many people a day and our servers work at a very fast pace. Sometimes this tends to come off as rude, but I assure you that's never the intention. I hope you reconsider and give us another try in the future.

"House of Nanking is a bit of an institution in SF.  I have stopped by for lunch periodically for the past 25 years.  What can I say?  The place is amazingly consistent.  Informal dining to be sure, but the service is fast, the food and tea are excellent, and prices are very reasonable.  

Today, I was dining solo in a hurry so I just grabbed the Sesame Chicken which is featured prominently on the menu.  The dish was extremely satisfying and served very quickly.  The staff has the experience down to a science, so timing was perfect.

I also enjoy coming here with friends, family, and co-workers.  Despite the bustle, customers are never rushed and it's a great place to have a conversation while sharing plates and sipping tea.  Add this noble house to your list.,Bob, it's truly been an honor to serve you for all of these years. This is one of the many reasons we simply love San Francisco -- the vibrant community is a joy to be a part of. You can't go wrong with the Sesame Chicken. Thank you so much for always dining with us and introducing our cuisine to new folks.

"We are a family of 24 who found eating at this restaurant to be a delightful experience along with having delicious food.  We were all puzzling over the menu when a woman came up, perhaps the owner,  and said, “I bring you stuff.  Do you eat meat?”  From than on it was one delicious dish after another.  We loved it!,What a wonderful family you brought with you! Thank you so much for dining with us. We understand the amount of options on our menu can be a lot, so we're always happy to make some recommendations, because we love introducing new flavors to our guests. We hope we'll get another chance to see you!

"Buzzing place to eat, quickly served tasty food and wine, reasonably priced. We enjoyed everything that was put on our table and were very happy.. until we payed and went to leave and the door was blocked by waiting staff demanding more tip. Very rude. Would not go back. Massive let down after a good meal.,Our top priority here is to make sure that you get a delicious meal with us. We appreciate you dining with us and for bringing your visit to my attention.

"I must admit that walking into a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown and only seeing tourists almost had me walking back out.  However, looking at the food on the table, it looked delicious and it was so glad we stayed.  The prices were reasonable and the portions quite large.  Two of us were full on the garlic fish and fried rice.  This place would be good for those friends who might be afraid to try other Chinatown places and would get a very good meal.,Cheryl, we're delighted you decided to dine with us! Thank you so much for dropping by. With our big portions, you'll always leave our place feeling warm and happy with your friends. It's wonderful to read you enjoyed the garlic fish and fried rice.

"Was referring by a friend who eats here when her family visits and she was spot on. Food was top notch and fast. We ordered most of the menu and for a group we left stuffed. 

Don't skip the onion pancake & the eggplant in chili garlic sauce.,Every meal deserves a great beginning -- and onion pancakes definitely take care of the job! I'm delighted to read you were referred to us by a friend. You brought in a great group of people; we had such a lovely time making sure you enjoyed the menu items. If you find yourself back in the city, we hope to serve you again!

"Our family of 9 (3 generations) stopped in for dinner while in San Francisco for vacation.  We were all so happy we did!  What an experience with great food thrown in to boot.  The youngest was 6 and the oldest 59 and All found many dishes to enjoy.  The favourite of everyone though was the sesame chicken ... to simply die for beyond a doubt!
Just tell them your basic needs/likes and let them take over the ordering for your party.  Most had a tea that had a blossom in the mug that opened as it sat on our table.
The sesame chicken is so very good that the memory will haunt you! LOL,It means the world to know everyone in your family enjoyed a meal with us, and thanks for sharing that the sesame chicken won everyone over. That  made my day!

"Living in NYC, you come to understand that good Chinese food can't be found in most of the country, with a couple of notable exceptions, San Francisco, Boston and perhaps Philadelphia. Picked this restaurant and heard good things about it. Had the pork egg rolls, homemade wonton soup and the salt and pepper shrimp. Everything was excellent. Don't come here for ambiance, there isn't any. It's a typical Chinatown Eatery. Egg rolls were loaded with pork and delicious. Wonton soup was unlike any other I've ever had. With crispy rice, lemon and very tasty wontons. Salt and pepper shrimp was delicious. The onion was specially prepared and amazing. 

As if to prove the point about this place, it was empty when I got there in late afternoon and packed when I left. Highly recommended.,You sound like you truly know your Chinese food, so it's great to hear this feedback. Also, well done with your choices! The pork egg rolls, wonton soup, and salt and pepper shrimp are a great combination. We'll see you next time.

'Til then,

"We went there at the recommendation of the tour guide of Big Bus. Literally he said its the only restaurant he recommends. Since it was a block away from our hotel, we stopped for an “early bird” dinner. We walked in and asked if they serve soup dumplings and she said yes (they don’t).  We sat down but literally everyone was on break, counting tips and making jokes. Nobody came to our table, and when we finally got up to leave, no one cared or even asked us why were leaving.  We went next door to House of Xian, and the food and service were good.,It sounds like we didn't quite met your expectations when you stopped in, and I apologize for that. You should feel valued here, so it's disappointing that things were off that day. I certainly hope you'll reconsider allowing us a second chance at a first impression.

"I came here with a group of friends. We booked a table for 10, and the restaurant was flexible at short notice, although when we arrived it was full, so we must have been lucky.

We ordered drinks, which included wine and goji berry tea. The goji berry tea came in huge mugs, a definite win.

For a group of 10 it’s hard to pick dishes everyone will want. The waiter saw our dilemma, and asked around the table for food preferences and allergies, then said leave it to me, and we did!

For starters we got a fried chicken dumpling (one of the best I’ve tasted) and a spring roll parcel, also delicious. We got a huge variety of mains dishes accompanied by fried rice. All the dishes were really good. The standout, for me, was a chicken dish with chunks of apple, which was unusual but worked really well.

We stayed for ages, we weren’t hurried at all, and when the check came it was a bargain! Highly recommended,Glad you had a wonderful time enjoying a variety of dishes with your group, Sarah! We're happy to accommodate as best as we can anytime, so come back and see us again soon.

"This small and very busy spot is a gem - the food was incredible!  Seating is family style and everyone seated around us were raving about this being their favorite and a certain stop any time they are anywhere near it....or not.  three gentlemen next to us dropped someone at the airport and came there for dinner - not exactly en route! I can understand why - we had the salt and pepper shrimp, sesame chicken and the beef wrap (can't remember actual menu name) all which were exceptional.  Best fried rice ever.  When we got there, there were about 10 people in line in front of us, but the staff moves fast and our wait wasn't long at all and totally worth it!,Happy to hear you found us and enjoyed a variety of dishes, Debbi! Come back soon for another round of your favorites or to try out some other ones.

"It was very busy and service was rushed. Some meals were very good but others were not so much. I have to admit, they brought us food quickly, which was truly remarkable, but it did not make up for the quality of the food.,It sounds like there was some inconsistency with your meal, so it's disappointing to hear you weren't a fan of each item you tried. However, we're always happy to recommend a few items based on your taste preferences to make sure you truly enjoy your meal.

"My husband and I were told that this was the best quality food in Chinatown. It was very good, but the quality of the food could not make up for the rushed and curt feel that the staff gave. The restaurant is crowded and we weren't very comfortable there. I would hesitate to recommend it for anyone who cares about any kind of ambience or polite service.,While I'm glad you did enjoy a delicious meal from us, I'm sorry service was at all rushed or curt.

"I tried to book, as I heard this place was popular/busy, it didn't work.  However we were hungry and arrived early.  We were ushered to a table for 6.  Drinks orders were taken immediately and the bottles of beer placed in front of us, no glasses.  Plastic beakers of water.  Food orders were requested, we asked for 5 minutes to consider the menu.  In 3 minutes, we were asked again.  We ordered and added a pak choi and beef recommendation on top.  Starters and main courses started to arrive in no particular order.  It was absolutely delicious!  No complaints from anyone at all.  After a week of beige food, wow this hit the mark!  Another beer later, we were out on the street.  A dining experience of 1 hour and 9 minutes.  Now that is turning your tables!  I'd go back tomorrow.  If you are after a sophisticated, leisurely dining experience, then for that particular night out, this isn't the place for you.  If you want to eat great food - go here asap!,While we do move at a fast pace.

"We came for a lunch and first of all we were 5 and they gave us 2 menus. It took them around 5 minutes and a lot of rolling eyes responses to gave us more menus. the food was cold and full of oil, the ambience with the waiters was horrible. They were so impatients, and acts like they doing us favors during the whole meal, And even ignored our calling.When we've got the bill they count the money infront of us and they asked with wondring ""what about the tip?"" We told them that we are not going to give them any tip after that wrost serviece and the waiter cursed us while saying ""You're a pussy!"".
It was a realy bad experience in Chinatown.,It's a bit concerning to hear about your experience, Paz, and I assure you we never intend to come off rude.

"We are from New York and have eaten Chinese food for 50 years.  This was different.  The Spring Roles were heavy, and the sesame noodles were bathed with a thin sauce.   Not to,our taste.  The Hot and Sour Soup was deliscious,  but bey different from what we were used to.  Perhaps it was more authentic than what we were used to, but it was different, and not for us.,It sounds like our dishes weren't quite what you expected, John, and I'm sorry to hear that. We're focused on serving up unique Chinese fusion dishes based on the history of our restaurant and customer requests, but we're always happy to recommend a few items you're sure to enjoy.

"My wife and decided on Nanking after walking around C'town looking for a good dinner spot.  There was a small crowd at the door and the restaurant is but two small rooms but we were waved in and seated immediately.  We had two dumpling starters. The steamed pork were out of this world. The fried dumplings, not so.  My fish with spinach salad was awesome; fresh, tender and plentiful for $14.95.  The home-made won-ton soup was super delicious, but different than the traditional won-ton soup.  The scallop tower w/eggplant was also a huge hit, lots of fresh & tasty greens.  We split a fresh green salad with sweet potato.  Lots of dishes for two for $60 and memorable.   Don't expect a romantic or quiet setting.  It's all about about the food!,Thank you for stopping in and checking out some of our dishes, Tony! It sounds like you enjoyed a variety of items from the steamed dumplings to the scallop tower -- glad you enjoyed it! I appreciate your feedback regarding the fried dumplings and will be sure to look into that further.

"Based on a friend's recommendation, we (party of 3) had dinner here during a trip to San Francisco. She had warned us about the line so we got there around 6pm on a Saturday. We were seated immediately at the last available seats, sharing a table with another couple. The service was fast, but not personable, as other reviewers have noted. I had not been expecting a gourmet restaurant so I wasn't surprised or disappointed by the service. I was disappointed that they were out of detox fruit tea, though. I don't feel good after eating fried food, so I ordered the garlic ginger poached scallops with spinach, but my husband and mother both got the sesame chicken. I enjoyed my meal and didn't feel overstuffed or lethargic afterwards. I tried a piece of sesame chicken and it was tasty, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I was pleased to have a relatively cheap and appetizing meal in San Francisco. P.S. There was a line down the block when we left.,It sounds like you had a nice time on your first visit, Carina, -- glad you enjoyed stopping in for a meal! I apologize that we were out of the tea you were hoping for, but I'm happy to hear you felt satisfied with your experience. The next time you're in the area, I hope you'll stop in to try out some of our other crowd-pleasing dishes.

"Based on friend's recommendation, my husband,my daughter and I went to the House of Nanking for dinner during our visit to San Francisco. We arrived at around 7 pm on a Wednesday evening, the line was out the door and on to the sidewalk. We were deciding whether or not to wait,when one of the customers leaving the restaurant said ""it's worth it"".  We were glad we decided to wait.
  The line moved quickly and we were soon seated.  Th restaurant is two storefronts side by side with tables fairly close together. The atmosphere is somewhat utilitarian..Small parties were asked to share tables with other diners.  Service is brisk and efficient. We shared an appetizer of crispy fried dumplings.  For our entrees we had the house specialty Sesame Chicken, Ginger Garlic Scallops and Fried Rice.Everything was hot, fresh and delicious.We shared everything and were stuffed.I had the unique Flower tea and my daughter had Plum Wine. Our bill was a little over $50. We were very pleased.,Glad you decided to check out our restaurant, Kiamom, and it's wonderful to hear you were impressed by the dumplings, sesame chicken, scallops, fried rice, and blossoming flower tea.

"Nearing the end of a 5 week vacation in North America, I am giving the second bad review out of dozens of good ones. Yuk!
We are very patient and we also don't mind an average dish occasionally,  but the whole experience this evening was , again yuk! I cant think of a better description. The service was nasty,  ""how many?"" ""Sit here!"" Then a couple of plastic sheets were thrown down in front of us. The rest of the meal was had with the constant barking of waiters to each other or the kitchen. The few dishes listed on the sheet were fairly uninspiring, so we looked around the room to see what ohers were eating. When we beconed the waitress and asked her what the neighbors were eating, she said that all 3 of their dishes were not on the menu! Huh? How is that supposed to work? She said ""what do you want"" (if she had asked "" tell me what you are after,  and we will build a dish around it"" we might have understood). Because she was rushing us,  we said beef, beans and chilli, and started to say chicken... and she said ""beef and beans and chicken sesame"" barked something to one of the other staff, and ran off. I should mention at this point, that the room was not full, and we didn't see what the rush was all about. The meals arrived, slapped down on the table with slop all around.  The beef dish was ok, but it seemed like a chilli sauce had been added, not fresh chilli. The sesame chicken was as good as you might expect from a small town food hall, just ...nluugghh!!
We decided to put it down to experience, and admit that tripadvisor reviewers had let us down, and asked for the check. When told by the ""head man"" that we were expected to pay a tip, I politely told him that its the first time that we felt that a tip was unwarranted, as the food was a let down, and the service was non existent, or at best rude.
I'd like to point out that during our time in America, we have happily tipped very well,  and if anyone would like to read my past reviews, they will see that I hardly ever complain, so you will see how disappointed I am. We have eaten ""chinese"" type meals in  lots of countries, so are not new to different styles, but..nup!,It sounds like we didn't quite meet your expectations on your visit, and that's disappointing to hear. We're used to being very busy which requires our team to work at a fast pace, but we never intend to be rude. We also have a unique way of doing things here from our service to our Chinese fusion dishes but apologize if it wasn't what you were hoping for. We understand we might not be for everyone but wish we could've left a better impression on you.

"I saw this restaurant featured on food network. Could not wait to get there. First parking is a nightmare. Then when we arrived we were ushered to the back and handed menus. Service was the second nightmare. The third nightmare was our food. 
This was a total let down.,We have a unique way of doing things here from our quick service to our Chinese fusion dishes, but it sounds like we didn't quite meet your expectations and that's a shame. I apologize if we gave you the wrong impression with our fast pace but assure you our only goal with this is to keep things moving quickly. I hope you'll reconsider giving us another chance to show you a five-star experience and recommend a few dishes you're sure to be impressed by.

"Based on the reviews and recommendations we decided to have lunch at Nankings and recognized it is very much overrated.

The staff is not trained on serving a guest at all and hence they appear to us as rude and mannerless. 
They welcome you with ""How many?"" and show you where you can find your table without seating you. Do not expect any ""Hi. Welcome. How are you. Is all OK? Do you need anything?...""
And it continued.. Someone just put menus on our table without any word and later just took the order. 

We got the appetizers and mains almost at the same time. The service was just too quick and hence we ate some of the dishes cold.

And the food? Hot and sour soup was tasty, pork dumplings very good but the ""famous"" sesame chicken was disappointing - it was just a quickly fried chicken without any specific taste.

Portions are big and we paid $60 for soup, dumplings, 2x sesame chicken, coke and beer.

We just did not feel well at Nonking.
Would select another place next time.,You could say we have a unique way of doing things here, Iveta, but I assure you our only goal is to seat and serve you a delicious meal quickly. Our team works at a fast pace to keep things moving quickly, so I understand this can come off rude but that's never our intention and apologize if we gave you the wrong impression. All this to say, it sounds like you had mixed opinions on some of the dishes you tried, but I hope you'll reconsider giving us another shot to show you a five-star experience with a meal you're sure to be impressed by.

"On a friend CAL's tip for the BEST Chinese food in SF, we stopped at the House of Nanking.  She was on point with this call!  The service was excellent & the food was even better.  When I was asked what I would like to eat, I was torn on a choice.  The waitress said they could make me something special & made a suggestion of Spicy beef with some bok choi.  It was incredible, tender, not too spicy & a great sauce.  The family style seating was fun and we made friends with the people next to us. The women next to me asked what I was having & I jokingly said I'm not sure, would you like to try some.  She loved it and asked for the same thing!  So if you're walking around Chinatown in SF then make plans to stop here!,It sounds like you enjoyed our unique family style dining and the recommended dishes, Mike, -- that's great! We're happy to hear the spicy beef impressed you and look forward to having you back soon to try out other items you're sure to love. Thanks for your kind words and support!

"This is some of the best chinese food we've ever had.  The food is fresh and delicious.  We had the Chicken Dumplings as an appetizer and I could eat those every day - delicious.  Sesame chicken was fantastic.  If you're looking for fancy service, this is not your place - but if you're looking for very good authentic chinese food - this is worth the stop.,Wow! The best Chinese food you've ever had? Thanks for the wonderful compliment! It's great to hear you were impressed by the chicken dumplings and sesame chicken.

"Popped in here on a whim and only because it was really busy very early into the lunch service which is usually a good marker.
Only realised this place must be well known when we saw Michael Portillo filming in there but we didn't let that put us off our food!
We had two starters: pork dumplings (really excellent) and a fried shrimp package which was also good. We then had a main of salt and pepper prawns with mushrooms, a jade spinach salad and steamed rice. One beer and a glass of wine, total bill $60 including tip.
Food was very good. They pack you in pretty tightly here so space is at a premium. I can also see why this place has a few bad comments about the staff being rude. We didn't find them overly welcoming but, as I said, it was already busy when we arrived and their aim seems to be to get people in, get 'em fed and get 'em out. They were never rude.
We enjoyed it there and would go again.,You tried a variety of dishes when you stopped in for lunch, so it's great to hear you were impressed by the dumplings, shrimp, salad, and rice! Thank you for taking the time to write this review -- your support means a lot to us. Hope you'll make it back our way again soon to try out more items on the menu!

"No AC on a hot day. Rude staff. Dirty, dark and stinky. Won't go back. Lettuce was dirty and brown. Should never have been served. Asked for new lettuce. Waiter grabbed the old lettuce right of the plate with his hands. Food was ok, nothing special. Sesame chicken was mostly bread, not much chicken and sauce was too salty. Not impressed.,We focus on fresh ingredients and flavorful dishes, Steven, so it's odd to hear this type of feedback. It sounds like things were a bit off when you stopped in, and I apologize if we missed the mark. I assure you we can do better than that, and hope you'll reconsider allowing us the chance to show you a five-star experience in the future.

"After arriving in Sanfransisco, we decided to have our first meal in the recommended House of Nanking. The food did not disappoint and we were extremely impressed with the quick service and delicious meal that we ate. Unfortunately this is were the positivity ends. We were hastily given our bill, €42.60, fine- a good meal and a couple of beers with quick service. In confusion, the waiter that originally collected our money reappeared muttering something about 3 dollars. Once he explained himself, we realised that he was accusing us of only paying 3! Unfortunately it was not just a misunderstanding that was quickly sorted. This went on for about 30 minutes, with various members of staff hurling abuse at us, one lady rudely pointing at our bags insisting that we check, and then shouting ""I don't believe you"". The whole of the lower part of the restaurant were witness to this shocking display of appalling customer service. How dare this collection of waitresses and waiters accuse us of not paying the full amount, who do you think we are? I am not only horrified at how we were spoken to and treated, but mortified at the sheer lack of compassion and understanding, not once did any member of staff actually listen to either of us, or the kind gentleman that was sat next to us, witnessing the whole thing. Leaving a restaurant in tears, and having to pay double the amount purely to avoid further confrontation and abuse is simply disgusting and I believe this establishment shouldn't be allowed to remain open. Appalled.,It's disappointing to hear about your recent experience dining with us, Harriet, and I apologize for the confusion. You should feel respected and valued here, but it sounds like we missed the mark showing you that. I assure you we don't condone any rude behavior of the sort, so I'll be speaking with the team about this. All this to say, it's a shame that we didn't show you the five-star experience we're capable of and wish you the very best.

"The food was good but the service was horrible. They sat us so close to another couple that they could have shared our food while there were other empty tables. Not once was there a thank you or do you want another drink.

"Hello!

A friend of ours recommended us to eat at your restaurant once we arrive at San Francisco. Us three had lunch today at 3 pm. We were looking forward to it and the food we saw on other tables was looking good aswell. Everything was alright until we had to pay. Our meals priced at about 36 Dollars plus the 10% service fee (almost 39$) and we gave you 41. The waiter then told us we had to pay even more and wrote down a random number (which was 45 in our case) onto the bill. We asked her where she got the number from or why we would have to pay even more than the 10% service fee. She said ""tip"". We handed her the extra 4 dollars as we didnt want to get into an argument (she was quite rude at the end)
As I know a tip is the decision of the customer alone based on the quality of the service provided. I find it very disrespectful of you to impose upon us young/foreign people just for the sake of your own greed. We will spread the word about your dishonesty and I really really hope it was worth the 4 dollars. 

Thanks for the ""hospitality"",It sounds like you enjoyed your meal but that your experience with your server at the end wasn't what you expected. While our team works hard to seat and serve you quickly, we never intend to put pressure on you with the tip or make you feel taken advantage of -- I apologize if that was the case. That being said, I'll be sure to speak with the team about this.

All this to say, after enjoying a delicious variety of dishes, I hope you'll make it back our way and allow us the chance to show you a five-star experience next time.

"The food, fair and bland. The service, rushed and rude.  The flowering tea, fun and floral tasting but not special...I think if you want a quick, Chinatown experience, try it.

"We enter the place and a Chinese woman rushes us to a table.  She doesn't like that we're four, because there were tables for 2 and for 6.  She ends siting us with another couple and throws us menus and comes back a minute later asking if we are ready.  As I try to explain that we are still looking the menu, she turns around and goes away not saying a thing.  Comes back another minute later (we now know we have to hurry) and we order.  The fried tofu, tempurized eggplant, sesame chicken and dumplings are very good, and the steamed scallops are memorable.  We finish our food and the woman brings us the check before asking for it, and not asking if we want dessert, or coffee (probably not something you get asked a lot in a chinese restaurant).  The check has more items than we ordered, and have to call her to have it fixed.  She doesn't even say sorry.  We are out of the place no more than 30 minutes after arrival.  Would you go to a place with excellent food and poor service?.  If the service is fast I probably would. My wife won't.,We have a unique way of doing things here when it comes to our service, but I assure you our only intention is to seat and serve you a delicious meal quickly.

"In short we felt despised. A previous visit in 2010 was frantic but friendly with excellent food. This time the food was below average and the servers treated us like dirt even resorting to shouting at us. Avoid avoid avoid.

"Chinatown is overloaded with choices. In a search for the most reviewed on Yelp, House of Nanking popped up. Our party was immensely grateful that we came across this restaurant because the food was delicious. There wasn't a single complaint in our whole group. 

The food is served family style. The portions are huge, so keep that in mind when ordering. We were told to wait outside for about ten minutes while space cleared for our party of five waited. We were seated in half the time, but ended up being seated a table with a young woman from New Zealand. Yes, they will seat you with strangers. In our case, it worked out wonderfully, but I could see this getting a little awkward if on a date. 

The food was excellent. I ordered the veggie egg rolls which are served in a pair and are almost a meal unto themselves. I also ordered Salt & Pepper shrimp, easily enough for two people, it was outstanding. It was seasoned perfectly and the shrimp was plentiful (not stingy like most places). In some ways, I think House of Nanking is slightly underrated by reviewers and I can understand why. Firstly, the space is too cramped, but that's a good thing because business is booming and House of Nanking is doing something right. Secondly, when we looked around everyone had something bottled to drink. At first we ordered water and were each brought warm tap water, without ice. Not sure of the temperature was intentional or not, but it certainly did the trick. It was a weird moment, but our group felt compelled to order sodas after the warm drinking water delivery. Will be visiting again.,Thank you for taking the time to write this review, Kari! I'm happy to hear you and your party enjoyed everything from the quick service to the variety of dishes to the large portions. Looking forward to the next time you make it our way!

"Totally underwhelmed. I understand this is the kind of place where ""it is what it is"" is a term that can be used, but it was so blah. The sesame chicken I had was OK. Had better in many different places. The 83 food handling score (needs improvement) showed as I watch a woman prepare our plates with no gloves and used the raw food containers as her prep station. She did the plate up of our dishes right on top of the plastic buckets. I have never seen that before. Server was terrible as I had to wave my hands to get his attention for drink refills and the like. You can do better.,You should be overwhelmed by delicious sesame chicken and impeccable service, so it's a bit disappointing to hear this. Our focus is on serving you an authentic and unique meal, but it sounds like we didn't impress you as well as we're capable of.

"The food was amazing, great taste and at a very reasonable price. The place is cozy although a little tight. The service could have been nicer though and it was a little on the slow side.

Because we didn't make the choices I can say for sure what the name of the dishes were but the normal pork fried rice and chow mien was obvious, the prawns with apples was absolutely delicious, we also had a pork dish and pot stickers.

"I must confess I had a reservation at an enticing, upscale establishment but the hubs wanted Chinese food (especially since in SF, which I get having felt the same on previous visits) so I relented. Best decision we made in the city--fantastic meal and actually affordable by SF dining standards! We got there at like 6:00 and were seated but after that it was non stop turning tables for people waiting so my advice--dine early! Most entertaining dining experience of our trip! Portions are incredibly generous so consider collaborating and sharing. I loved this place and would go back in a SF minute--in fact may add this to my list of SF ""must do"" rituals,What a wonderful surprise for you and your husband!

"We went to dinner here on the positive reviews of Trip Advisor and this place didn't disappoint! We ordered the sesame chicken, wonton soup and steamed pork dumplings. The dumplings came out first-rich, full of flavor and succulent! The soup came next and to be blunt was very disappointing (it sucked!). The crown jewel came after that and we devoured every last bite! 
As far as atmosphere it was non existent. It's a Friday night and the tables and people are shoved into this place nuts-to-butts! No date night here...but the food really makes up for it and makes it a dining  experience!,When you're in search of an authentic experience and impressive meal, Sid, you can count on us to deliver!

Totally worth a visit.,I'm thrilled your fried dumplings and rice hit the spot. Not to mention that calamari -- that light citrus sauce really is something!

"when we pulled up to the restaurant there was a pretty big line but we had six people oin a Saturday night with no reservations and only waited 15-20 mins. We started looking at the menu and right after they took or drink order she asked if we had any food allergies. When we said no, she quickly said that instead of ordering, she would bring us all different dishes. The best was probably the nanking sesame chicken but we lived it all! The five spice pork chop was amazingly tender, almost like pork belly. The shrimp with apple and a white cream sauce was unlike any dish I've ever gotten. The fish was lightly fried and served with veggies and a sweet  glaze. The woman helping us was right, Judy let them pick for you! We got several things I probably wouldn't have picked on a menu but each was unique and delicious. Plus it's priced very reasonable, we had 6 people and everyone left stuffed for around $120 total including beers. My friend who's a local says this is now her new favorite spot in Chinatown,Being seated quickly and served a delicious meal is important, Ashley, so it's great to hear you were impressed with the short wait time and tasty dishes.

"Very simple and unpretentious place. Food is fairly decent. Efficient service. Reasonably priced - good value for money. Good place to bring a family for a quick meal.

And if you are adventurous you may also want to try the pork wanton soup that is topped with crispy rice :),It's great you stopped by and tried out our Chinese fusion. The sesame chicken and wonton soup seemed to hit the spot well -- that's awesome! Hope you'll visit us again the next time you're in the area.

"This is a restaurant that you may not choose on your own.  It is otherwise nondescript.  However quite often, you will see a line of several people out the door.  There were about 15 people in line when i showed up.  However the line moved fairly quickly.  Service was good.  We didn't order off the menu but instead asked our server to select.  The sesame chicken is excellent.  Food arrived quickly and was really good.  A must visit when in San Francisco.,It's great you stopped in and enjoyed the sesame chicken! We're always happy to recommend crowd pleasing dishes and hope to serve you more dishes soon. Thanks for your support!

"We had sesame chicken and a scallop dish, both were very good!  Busy place, they get you in and serve food quickly.  We enjoyed the fun vibe in the restaurant.  You may be sitting with strangers, but it's all good!,Both are excellent choices, Liza, so I'm glad you enjoyed the sesame chicken and scallop dish. We do our best to get you seated and served a delicious meal quickly -- thanks for noticing! Hope to see you back soon.

"Never have had a bad meal here.  Gets a little busy might have to share a table but it's worth it.  Just ate here again the other day and it was excellent.

"This place was next to our hotel. Had big lines every day of the weekend so we were not willing to wait... but on Monday there was no line & we just walked by & were hungry.. so we tried it.. Great food. Those pork eggrolls are amazing! The sweet potato-eggplant dish is soooo delicious! ( to share , it is BIG ),  fired calamari is also really good &  my daughter loved the house noodles.
We also tried the crispy noodle tower with beef... & my husband liked it but I didnt since it had some sort of curry taste ....
Oh! And they have a tea that had a dried flower floating inside that with the heat of the tea blooms inside! 
& the best of all is that prices are good!
The service is bot so good..  They all looked stressed & in a hurry & you feel like they are rushing you out when you are almost finished... But don't take it personal.. it is chinatown! Concentrate on the food!
We went twice on our trip & I would go back right now if I lived there.,Pork egg rolls to sweet potato eggplant to fried calamari, Maria, it's great to hear you were impressed but it all! With a variety of unique dishes to try, you can always count on discovering a few favorites. Thanks for stopping in and leaving these kind words -- hope you and your family will make it back our way again soon!

"I checked TripAdvisor to find this restaurant had good review and close to my hotel, after ordering the food and asked waitress if they use MSG, she said all food in here use it. All the dishes I ordered are very salty. And it's quite expensive, they also charge for tea and white rice.,It sounds like your meal didn't quite meet your expectations, and I'm sorry to hear that. Our dishes have unique flavors and I understand they aren't for everyone. However, we're always happy to make adjustments per request or recommend a few dishes you're sure to love based on your taste preferences. That being said, we hope you'll give us another shot to impress you with a dish or two you're sure to love.

"Trip advisor rated this place highly, and the wait looked like it was justified. It was recommended by many of the locals. Bad news, folks. The owners that had the Chopped chef, and built the reputation sold about 4 months ago. They feed you through, like cattle in a chute. The food was absolutely terrible, the servers were rude, the manager insisted that we pay for the food. We didn't, she took it off, we paid for our drinks, and that was it. It was the absolute worst dining experience of the 8 days we spent in Northern Cali. If there was a rating worse than terrible, I would give it to this place. Disgusting. The only dining establishment, that I have such a poor rating to, the entire trip. No other place was below a 4. Terrible place.,It's disappointing to hear you didn't have the experience you expected, Michael, but I assure you we never intend to make you feel rushed or disrespected. Our only goal is to seat and serve you a delicious meal quickly, but it sounds like our unique service and recipes aren't quite your style -- sorry to hear that. With all of our high ratings, we feel we're doing something right but might not be the right place for you. We wish you the best!

"No ordering, they just brought plate after plate of deliciousness, and plenty of beers too. So smart, woulda taken quite a while to get our heads together and order, instead we were chowing down right away (and they turn the table more quickly too). Accommodated the vegetarians and gluten intolerant in our group and I'd say we all left full and happy.,Cheers to a delicious and satisfying meal served quickly, Brian! Glad you enjoyed it and were able to relax while we did the ordering for you. We're always happy to do that and accommodate as needed, so we hope to have you back again for another wowing meal.

"This place is unassuming looking but you are in for a culinary treat! We walked in and were seated at one end of a shared long table. Our waitress asked if we had been before. We told her we had not. She took our menus and said she would order family style for us. First, she brought out fantastic dumplings that were heaven to eat. Then, she gave us white rice, a beef dish, Nanking sesame chicken, and a shrimp and mushroom dish. We seriously could not stop eating. Every single thing was filled with so much flavor. Hands down the best Chinese food I have had anywhere. This place is not to be missed.,It sounds like you were blown away with some fantastic dishes, Keyton, and that makes my day to hear! We're always happy to order for you or recommend some common favorites, so we sure hope you'll make it back soon for another round out-of-this-world dumplings. Thank you for your support!

"Delicious sesame chicken! The sweet potatoes that came with it were also pretty tasty. Not a huge fan of the sizzling soup although my sister really like it.

"The service was absolutely fantastic. We were seated immediately and got our food right away. We ordered the fried potstickers, chow mein, egg rolls, and the sesame chicken.

"Eating at the House Of Nanking is becoming a tradition for us whenever we visit San Francisco from Los Angeles. At first, when my parents and I arrived in the city, my original goal was to try something new at restaurants that we had not eaten at before. Well that plan did not last very long. We had lunch at a different restaurant but when it came time for dinner, my parents and I were all thinking the same thing that we were going to make a exception to the plan and go eat at House Of Nanking.

Just as we did the last two times that we ate here, we had Peter's Wife order for us. I tell her, that I want a soup, seafood, chicken and a beef dish. The only thing she asks us if we like spicy or not and then all we have to do is wait for the food. We will always get a dish that is not on the menu and the diners around us will gawk and ask the waiters. ""what are they eating over there."" Even the dishes that are on the menu such as the their famous Sesame Chicken is prepared differently for us by making the sauce spicy. While many other restaurants will throw in some hot chiles and call it a day, at the House of Nanking, the spicy works with the overall flavor of the dish and I think it enhances the flavor for people like my parents and myself who love spicy food.

Our only regret is that we did not skip the restaurant that we had lunch at, and ate here sooner. My parents and I live down in SoCal and whenever one of our friends or coworkers asks us about places to eat in San Francisco, the first place is always the House Of Nanking.,It's great to hear you made an exception and dined with us for a round of your classic favorite dishes on your recent visit! Knowing you're a fan of our food and always make a point to stop in for a taste is quite the compliment, so thanks for your support. We sure look forward to having you in again for more sesame chicken soon!

"We visited on a midweek evening and people were still queuing outside for tables. The four of us shared 2 appetizers and three entrees and there was plenty to go round. My favourite dishes were the deep fried egg plant and the sesame chicken. We also had the crispy beef which wasn't on the menu, and was deliciously tender. The service was very hurried and somewhat brusque but the food was fresh and delicious so we were prepared to let that go. Dishes were reasonably priced.,The deep fried eggplant and sesame chicken are excellent choices, Sarah, so it's great to hear you're a fan of both! If you felt felt rushed, we apologize, but assure you our only intention is to seat and serve you a delicious meal quickly.

"We visited at 7pm on a Monday. My wife and I shared 2 starters and 2 entrees. All 4 meals were very tasty indeed. Ok it's not the most salubrious but the food is what you go there for. It's great value for money and by the time we left the place was full with about a dozen waiting outside. Surely that's a good enough recommendation too?,Sharing four dishes between you and your wife is a great way to enjoy some variety and get a taste of our authentic Chinese food, Paul, so I'm glad to hear you enjoyed your meal! We sure appreciate you stopping in for a bite and hope you'll make it back for another round of your favorites.

"Set your expectations of what Chinese food should be aside before you visit House of Nanking.  This is a neighborhood joint in the heart of Chinatown that apparently is always packed to the rafters.  The menu is fairly limited and tends to the fried side of preparation.  Don't expect machine-rolled won ton wrappers here, since the dough used for same is handmade and thick.  I honestly can't remember what we ordered; every dish looked the same, mostly brown.  The wait staff is entertainingly impatient.  Fun for a one-time visit, though I can't see going there again any time soon.,It's interesting to hear this feedback but understand that our unique Chinese fusion isn't for everyone. While we have many crowd pleasing dishes we're happy to recommend, it's disappointing to hear you weren't impressed with your meal. Our overall goal is to serve you a delicious dish in a timely manner, so I apologize if this made you feel rushed -- that's never our intention.

"My uber driver recommended this place for really good Chinese food in the heart of Chinatown.  Walking in it was intimidating because it was crowded and noisy, but they sat us down at a table with other people.  I guess that is the norm.  It took me by surprise at first but ended up being really lovely and enjoyable.  The food came really quickly, which I appreciated as I was about to start chewing on the arm of the stranger next to me, even without knowing where her arm had been.  

The food itself was great.  We ordered a few different dishes to try out and I loved all of them.  All-in-all it was a great experience.  I'm so glad I went. There was a nearby place that President Obama had been to which was getting all the hype, but seemed to touristy, so House of Nanking was just right.,What a wonderful surprise for you, Natalie! Glad you went off of your driver's recommendation and gave us a try. While we can appear busy, our team works hard to keep things moving quickly so you can enjoy the delicious meal you're craving. We certainly hope you discovered a few favorite dishes and will be back our way soon to try out even more!

"Our family of five, kids ages 15, 12 and 9, were visiting San Francisco's Chinatown for the first time. We wanted a real Chinese restaurant experience and a resident friend highly recommended House of Nanking. We arrived right at 5 o'clock and did not have to wait to be seated. Since this was not American Chinese food, we did not know what to order. The waiter said he would bring us a variety of dishes and asked us if there were any dietary preferences. Based on our reply, he brought us an appetizer and four dishes for us to share family style. They were all equally delicious. My only complaint is that the soda was served in a can at the rate of $2.95 a piece and so there were no complimentary refills.,What a great family experience enjoying some delicious Chinese food during your visit, Lisa! It sounds like you and your family had a nice time trying out a variety of dishes and discovering some new favorites -- that's wonderful! We sure hope you'll make it back our way the next time you're in the area.

"I did not like the food and service. Do not recommend! The sesame chicken was horrible and the vegetable egg rolls where extremely grease.,The egg rolls and sesame chicken are some of our most common favorite dishes that we serve, so it's a bit concerning to hear this. It sounds like things may have been a bit off when you visited, but we wish we could've left a better impression on you.

"I really do not understand the hype of this place AT ALL. the sesame chicken is all the rave so that's what we ordered. I'm honestly not even sure if there was chicken if there or just fried batter? As for the chow mien... Panda Express has a better recipe than they do. Long wait to get in and employees were not very friendly. Would not recommend this place!,The sesame chicken and chow mein are typically quite the crowd pleasers, Caroline, so it's odd to hear that you weren't impressed. Our recipes derive from our restaurant's history as well as customer feedback, so it's a shame that your meal didn't meet your expectations. We wish we could've left a better impression you but understand that we may not be for everyone.

"The food was good, however it is on one of the main bus routes. I think it caters a little more to the tourists than other you may finding further in China town. With that said the food was still good. When everyone is just hungry and wants to stop and you cannot spend time searching out something more authentic this is the place."
"Kept being told to try Nankings Chinese restaurant by barman and the Tour guides on hop-on-hop-off bus if going to china town, (almost as if on commission, 3 times 1 guide mentioned it on a 20 minute trip)  but to be honest didn't see what all the fuss was about.  Very basic cafe style, waiter expected us to order immediately, he hovered over us obviously frustrated whilst I looked for my reading glass before I could look at the menu, which I felt was limited, the food was served up within minutes, drinks all served in the can! cutlery 1 fork served on chipped plates. and the bill placed on table without being requested.

The food was tasty, but enormous portions so a lot of waste but I felt over priced for the experience as a whole.  Famous for being famous, I think.,We understand our unique food and service may not be for everyone, but it's disappointing to hear you weren't impressed. Our team works hard to seat and serve you quickly but never intend to make you feel rushed, so I apologize if it came off that way.

We had to go to the House of Nanking and it was worth the visit! The Sesame Chicken is a must as were the dumplings! We also loved the shrimp and mushrooms. The one dish we did not enjoy as much was the fried noodles (but I think that they may not have been freshly made). Loved the jasmin tea!!!
"We had been recommended to try the House of Nanking, and it is absolutely an experience not to be missed.  We arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant closed, but were seated and had food on the table before the kitchen staff left, at nine on the dot.  The food was great, and the service, while direct was efficient - you would not want to mess with these wait staff!  People who arrived after us are told in no uncertain terms that the restaurant was closed and that they should leave!  It did seem a little like a comedy sketch, but you have to eat here and experience it!"
"This was recommended to us before we visited San Francisco. It's close to Financial District and also Chinatown. We were staying in the nearby Hilton so very convenient. From outside, it's not attractive. However the food was top drawer, staff were very nice and good and you can be in and out very quick if in a hurry"
"We were looking forward to our dinner at House of Nanking based on the reviews we read, but were disappointed.  We sat down, ordered fried dumplings, Sesame Chicken and noodles.  The food came out of the kitchen in less than 5 mins which indicated to us that it wasn't fresh.  Our dinner literally lasted 25 mins.  The price was reasonable and staff nice, but menu was limited, not fresh and dinner felt too rushed.,Your first visit to our restaurant should exceed your expectations, Ashley, but I'm sorry to hear you weren't impressed. Our team works hard to seat and serve you quickly while ensuring your meals are fresh and of the highest quality. We never intend to make you feel rushed or doubt the freshness, so I apologize if it came across that way and can assure you that we cook all dishes as they're ordered. All this to say, we hope you enjoyed your food and will allow us a second chance at a first impression in the future.

"Been to San Francisco many time and have always heard about this place. So on this  visit 5 of us decided to give it a go based on recommendation from other people. 

There was a queue outside the restaurant when we arrived around 6.30 pm. It wasn't a very long queue and we had our table within 15 minutes which was good. 

The food was okay and tasty enough but it wasn't exceptional outstanding in any way. I would said it was slightly above average but nothing special about it. 

The whole dinning experience was spoilt thought by the service staff. We were attended by a female as well as a male staff. They were rude and really did not care to give any basic  friendly service at all. All the time we felt we were a burden to them instead of paying their wages. 

We were NOT be coming back to this restaurant nor recommend it to anyone. The staff here needs to learn some basic manner. Restaurant was busy but that is not an excuse for poor and very bad manner staff. Twice both the staff rolled their eyes on us and 3 times they simple walked away while we enquires about the menu. When we asked to order the dessert at the end of the meal, the male staff just wave his hand in a gesture to say they don't have any dessert and dimple walked away.

As soon as we have finished our meals and still finishing our beer and wine, we were given the ""looks"" a few time by the staff as they want us out asap to make room for other people waiting. All in all you felt rush and certainly a very unwelcome atmosphere.

For service wise I will give this place the most a 1 star. Food wise a 3 star. It was a disappointing service to say the least ."
"Upon arriving in San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a walk through Chinatown to get our touring started. A walk through Chinatown made us hungry for chinese food so we went to TripAdvisor and picked House of Nanking based on reviews. We both tried the much loved Sesame Chicken and steamed rice. Our meal was plentiful and good but nothing really great compared to other chinese we have had. If looking for a good chinese food, you could definitely try it out when in San Francisco. There was a line out the door to get in."
"Soup perfect to warm up! Beef and noodles were excellent! Ignore the service and go with the flow :p,Glad you got a great bowl of soup to warm up with, Evrard! Thanks for your review, and we hope we see you around one of our tables again soon.

"If you are in the mood for great Chinese food then House of Nanking is the place to go.  I am in town with my family for a vacation and wanted to try something in China Town.  Though it was very busy we got in within a few minutes.  To say it is busy and noisy is an understatement.  The decor is very no frills, but this adds to the feeling of authenticity.
We started with the fried pork potstickers and the onion cakes.  The onion cakes were a very unique and delicious offering.  The potstickers were good, but not great. 
For the entree 3 of us had the sesame chicken.  This was probably the best thing that I have ever had at a Chinese restaurant.  
This is definitely not a place for a romantic dinner.  It is ,however, great for a noisy good time with family or friends for authentic Chinese food. Would definitely come back.,We're already looking forward to having you back, Chris! We're so happy to know that the sesame chicken hit the spot, and that you enjoyed the fried pot stickers as well as the onion cakes. You made some wonderful choices, and we hope to see you back in SF soon.

"Our first trip to San Francisco and we headed straight for Chinatown because we love Chinese food... especially authentic Chinese food.. We were given a couple of suggestions, the other restaurant that we wanted to go to was closed for vacation so we headed to House of Nanking based on the numerous recommendations.  It didn't look special but it was busy for lunch time so we were excited to dig in.  We were first not to impressed with the menu and asked what the house favorites were and she said just what is on menu.  So we tried the famous Sesame Chicken, a couple appetizers and their famous noodles.  We were so disappointed.  We ordered the pork buns which we expected to be buns not wontons, the noodles that we were most excited about had no flavor and we kept waiting to see if they were going to get better.  The Sesame Chicken was good, but it wasn't the best I ever had.  So sadly this was a let down on our first place to eat in San Francisco.,Your first meal in San Francisco deserves to be a great one, so I'm particularly disappointed you weren't wowed with your lunch. Our Sesame Chicken, noodles, and pork buns are typically crowd-pleasers, so I am curious about what happened here. Since your experience is particularly out of the ordinary for us, we hope you can give us another chance to show you what we're truly all about.

"Some of the best Chinese food I've had.  The restaurant itself isn't particularly nice, but the food was super.  Would definitely come here again."
"Best Chinese eaten in a long long while, just good tasty food in a clean and serviceable setting i.e. no frills or fluffy stuff.

Don't be worried if you have to queue, they work through it quite quickly. We arrived 8:15 ish and had about 15 min wait. Service is fast but when you see the volume if people v food v size of restaurant you'll understand why. And to be honest I don't care when the food is this good. You may even get the bill before you've finished, don't be offended they are trying to make sure we all get a chance to eat.

We put our trust in waitress told her what we didn't like she then made selections and brought a number of dishes to the table. Portion sizes are good,  I think my favourite was all of it ! All washed down with Chinese beers one happy party of 4. 

Just love love love this place would definitely go again will see if we can fit another visit before we leave."
"We snuck in at 6.30 pm on a Thursday just ahead of the fast forming queue. And we will be returning.

I love it when I find a place that I can add to my regulars list. Nanking got the latest spot. The restaurant is very basic; almost street food in an Asian capital. The food was served very quickly but in a bit of an unpredictable order.

The squid described as melt-in-mouth, actually was. Lightly seasoned and stir fried. Great texture and freshness and very tender. Next up were the chicken lettuce wraps. An eclectic mix of vegetables and boneless chicken stir fried together. Very tasty with our without the lettuce cups. Hot and sour soup was well balanced and typical china town fare. I have had better but this one was great too. Salt and pepper shrimp with mushrooms. A bit off the beaten path as typically there is no bed of mushrooms. Still once again the prawns were very fresh, done just right and seasoned to enhance the meat. Wonderful. String beans were a tasty addition to the rest of the food. Too bad we could not try a few more offerings.

Total was a very reasonable $75 for 4.,What a great feeling to add another favorite restaurant to your list, Azad-musafir! It's quite the compliment to know you're a fan  and had the chance to enjoy quite the variety from the squid to the string beans. We're looking forward to having you back to try even more items on our menu for another delicious experience!

I went to this restaurant based on trip advisor reviews. I am glad I found this place. The food was good. I had the calamari and it was really good. There was a line outside but service was fast. It looked like there were a lot of locals there so definitely a place to check out when you are in San Francisco.
"We went here on the basis of Trip Advisor recommendations. The restaurant is massively busy and people actually queue outside to wait for a seat, which tells you a lot about either its reputation or the quality. Unfortunately its reputation is overblown. Whilst the food is really tasty and quite different from what we are used to in England, and the restaurant is really packed, lively and atmospheric there is a significant slice of being ripped off!!!!!!!
As soon as you get a seat we were expected to order, when we asked for time to study the menu, we were given no more than a minute or so. Then the head waiter / owner all but insisted that we should trust him to provide a "" family meal"" for us at about 20 or 25$ a head. We were almost bamboozled and rushed into accepting this. DONT AGREE TO THIS!!!!!!
In the end it cost us over 30$ a head for food that we didn't choose and it was brought to the table so fast that we were back outside after 45 minutes, feeling that whilst we enjoyed the food we had been taken advantage of.

Our advice is check the menu online or outside the restaurant before going in and make them wait and don't agree to them rushing you through, no matter what they say!!
Oh and no matter what they reply this place clearly operates a rush them through policy to turn over the tables as fast as possible.,Branching out and trying a new restaurant can be an enjoyable adventure, but it sounds like our unique service was a bit of a surprise to you. One of our top priorities is to get you seated and served a delicious meal in a timely manner, so I apologize if you didn't expect the quick nature of our restaurant. We never intend to come off as rude and certainly don't mean to make you feel rushed -- we simply want to help you discover a new favorite meal and enjoy it. It sounds like you did enjoy your food though, and that's great! We appreciate you stopping by and hope you have safe travels. Take care!

"If you're in Chinatown and hungry for some great Chinese cuisine, this is the place!  We had several things on the menu and had a tough time deciding what was our favorite.  Their famous sesame chicken was on point, the calamari was to die for, and the potstickers were amazing.  If you're a fan of hot tea, get the blooming flower tea.  Amazing experience.  Will return.,From the sesame chicken to the blooming flower tea, it sounds like you had a great time trying out some of our unique dishes and drinks -- that's awesome to hear!

"We had previously seen House of Nanking on a Travel Channel show Food Paradise and put it on our list of places to visit when we stayed in San Francisco.  This restaurant does not disappoint.  We had the steamed dumplings for appetizer and main entrees of the sesame chicken and crispy noodles with beef. The beef was as tender as we have had in quite some time.  I recommend getting the hot flower tea as well. It comes in a beer mug size glass with the flower giving the tea an aroma and flavor.  Since we were there between lunch and dinner rush it wasn't as busy as dinner rush; the owner came by and seemed quite pleased we enjoyed his restaurant and we'd come from out of town to visit. Yes the staff can be abrupt but that's the style from the volume  of business they do.,It's awesome that you saw us on the show and came by to check us out, Steve! It's great to know our food impressed you, and we appreciate your understanding of our efficient and unique service.

Next visit I hope.,Glad you stopped by to check us out for lunch, Grace, and it's great to hear you enjoyed the calamari.

"We asked for suggestions as we weren't sure was to order, and everything we were served was very good. Place is tiny and extremely busy, we had a hard time squeezing the baby high chair in there for dinner, but staff was very helpful and excited about the kids. The Won Ton soup is super tasty. Do not be afraid to ask the server for help if you aren't sure what to order. Parking can be an issue, we found an inexpensive indoor parking lot about a block away.,We're always happy to offer recommendations to you, Hugues, and it's great to hear you enjoyed some delicious dishes! We'll be looking forward to having you back for another round soon. 

Till next time,

"Although I'm sure the owner was trying to be helpful by suggesting the food choices, ultimately it was not good,While we're always happy to offer recommendations, Martin, we're sorry to hear your meal didn't meet your expectations. Our dishes are Chinese fusion, so they can be different than what you've had in the past from other Chinese restaurants. However, we hope you'll be back to try out other items on the menu you're sure to love.

"A nice small/medium sized restaurant that is just authentic enough for a first night in San Francisco meal.  Fusion (ie slightly Americanized) Asian food.  Excellent appetizers (shrimp, steamed pork dumplings) and hybiscus tea.  Excellent white fish dish with perfectly cooked white fish lightly seasoned with spinach.  Unfortunately our second and third entree was the sesame chicken which will be better at your local mall Chinese take out.  Wish I had ordered the pork stuffed mushrooms or the scallops.  

Stick with the Asian dishes and you will have a great meal!,It sounds like you tried quite a bit on our menu when you visited, so it's great to hear you enjoyed your appetizers! Although the sesame chicken didn't quite meet your expectations, we hope you'll be back for a perfect experience next time while enjoying some stuffed mushrooms or scallops. Take care! 

Warm regards,

"With deep fried Peking raviolis and a sizziling rice soup with no sizzle, we were disappointed with our lunch.  Our fish dish with ginger and scallions turned out to be something else, but tasty as a deep fried fish dish.  The tea ordered was billed but not delivered and finally corrected and their credit card machine was again broken and only cash accepted.  In the end, interesting food, but not very accurate to taste, poor service, but modest prices.  With Chinatown around the corner one should easily do better.  Possibly due to the film crew, the chief was off his/her game.,A craving for delicious Chinese food is a serious thing, but I'm sorry to hear your meal didn't meet your expectations. We've fused together a combination of recipes throughout our restaurant's history with customer requests to create the dishes that we serve. That being said, I hope you'll allow us the opportunity to recommend a few options and serve you a delicious meal that you'll love next time.

"We arrived and we told to sit anywhere in the adjoining room.  We were then rudely ushered to a table the exact same size further into the room for no reason.  The matriarch came to take our order 30 seconds after sitting down, then seemed irritated that we weren't ready to order.  We had our kids, 11 and 13, with us and they needed to take time to figure out what they wanted.  Unfortunately, the menu was very limited, only one page, and not a lot of variety.  We just ordered the first two things that sounded ok, with soups and fried rice.  The hot and sour soups were unlike any we have ever had and arrived with an oil blob floating on the top.  The pot stickers were ok.  The sesame chicken was the best part of the meal, but was sub-par compared to other places we have had this.  The fried rice was bland and pretty flavorless.  The portions were smaller than expected as well.  No conversation with the staff, no friendliness.  We were left wishing we had tried somewhere else for our one meal in Chinatown.  Not sure why it has such a reputation for being the place to eat.,When you dine with us our top priority is to make sure you get seated and served promptly, so I can assure you that we never intend to give off any impression other than that. The unique service that we offer can be a bit of a surprise along with our Chinese fusion we've created, but I'm sorry to hear it wasn't what you expected. We hope to show you a perfect experience with a meal that you love in the future.

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"There are so many great places to eat and this is not one of them. I should have known when the place next door had a long line and this dump did not. Where do I start my story of this tired old place. The food is not good, the service is what you would expect from a tourist place that preys on travelers. The workers were cranky an lazy and used to having tourists to serve their slop. We noticed one worker coughing in his hands and picking his nose and the serving people and handing out straws.  There are so many places to eat .. don't come here .,While we understand that our food and service is very unique, it's unfortunate to hear you didn't have the experience you expected. The recipes we create are Chinese fusion and our service is focused on efficiency to make sure you're served promptly, so we apologize if you were caught off guard by this. We can also assure you that we take cleanliness and hygiene very seriously along with following health policies. All this to say, we wish we could've left a more positive impression on you and hope for the chance to do that in the future.

"We got in quickly to eat on a Thursday night around 6:30 PM. We ordered the Beef, lettuce wraps, Fried calamari and sesame chicken. Food was fantastic, bathrooms poorly lit, used as storage, none too clean. They are crazy busy, but they can be a little friendly and fill drinks.,Glad you enjoyed your dinner with us and were able to try a nice variety on our menu. Making sure you receive the delicious meal you're craving is very important to us along with serving you in a timely manner, so thanks for noticing! Hope you'll be back soon for another awesome experience and tasty dinner.

Come on back soon for another round of your favorites.

Gave us the great experience we were looking for in our exploration of San Francisco's Chinatown. We have had many good meals in  NYC's Chinatown and without a doubt this meal topped them all !,What a great surprise to find a delicious meal and awesome experience during your visit in SF -- that makes my day! Hope you'll be back soon for another wonderful time.

Try the Nanking chicken!,It's such a compliment to be your favorite Chinese restaurant -- thanks!! Glad to hear we can impress each time with our food and service alike. Hope you'll be back soon for another delicious bite and awesome time!

Thanks again,

"We arrived here shortly before 12pm, just as well because it filled up pretty quickly afterwards. The smells wafting from the kitchen are just delicious. The service isn't overly friendly, but my experience with other American Chinese restaurants is mostly the same. Our meals arrived promptly and were delicious, as we expected from all the rave reviews. Between the 4 of us we ordered the sesame chicken, fried calamari and beef. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals!,It sounds like you tried a variety on our menu, Larvan, and it's great to hear you enjoyed your meals! We focus on serving you delicious food in a timely manner, so we apologize if our unique service was a bit of a surprise to you. All this to say, our only intention is to make sure you leave happy and satisfied, so we hope you'll be back soon for another tasty meal.

"I would have given zero but unfortunetaly it's not possible on this website. My friends and me had the worst service we have ever recieved in a restaurant. They gave us the bill after almost 20 minutes we had begin eating and during our short dinner the waitress continued hurry us. We were so annoyed that we decided to stop eating and we paid the bill. Some suggestion: don't go there if you have enough time to enjoy a decent dinner.,Please accept my apologies if our service came across as rude, Massimiliano. We're not your average restaurant, and we're more authentic than many are used to when it comes to our quick and to the point service. Although your service wasn't what you expected, I do hope you were able to enjoy a delicious meal with us.

Warm regards,

"Dropped in for a late lunch on Saturday and had no trouble with lines or over-crowding.
Service was quick, food was tasty and authentic. Cheapest meal we have ever had in San Francisco. Would recommend to friends and family.,Glad you stopped by and enjoyed your lunch last weekend! It sounds like you had an awesome experience, and that really makes my my day. Thanks so much for your recommendation and hope to see you again soon. 

Till next time!

"Tucked away on Keary Rd one over from Grant St and the China town district, house of Nanking is certainly an experience. Greeted by a grumpy matriarch upon entering we were ordered to a table. The restaurant is fast & furious turning patrons over quickly. As soon a drink was ordered it was at the table as was the food and then the bill. I wouldn't say there is an extensive menu but enough to suit most visitors, the food was tasty hence the queues that are often found leading out the front door. If you plan on going, roll in around 6 or 6.30 & that will give you the best chance of getting a table with out waiting.,Glad you came by and enjoyed a tasty meal, Shaun, as that is our top priority. We work at an extremely fast pace to make sure you receive the delicious meal you came for, so I apologize if you got the wrong impression when you were greeted. I'm very passionate about sharing our unique dishes with others, so I hope you'll be back soon for another satisfying dinner.

Warmest regards,

"The food has been adjusted to satisfy American taste buds. No chop sticks. Zero Chinese pride.

"First, it's not in Chinatown, it's on the periphery.  Second, this restaurant has been reviewed; what's new? 

Here's the dealio: if you are new to downtown San Fran, you may NOT know where to get an authentic Chinese food meal, at a reasonable price combined with easy access & moderate prices.  If you're solo and it's a Fri./ Sat. evening, get there before 6:00PM; 6:30PM at the latest.  Other evenings, a solo diner could be accommodated as late as 8:00PM.  The interior layout is reconfigurable tables so a solo & party of two are easily seated.  

Next, don't go here to spend an entire evening. The staff need to turn the tables to accommodate diners; the lines can easily get 20+ deep. The food is incredible; Hot-n-Sour Soup is especially well done.  Everything else on the menu: zero culinary disappointments. 

Lastly, the staff is business like but not abrupt. And, you'll find plenty of ethnic Chinese locals dining here.  Could it be because it's great???,Authentic Chinese food, quick service, and an impressive menu selection, Vince, you really get what we're about! Thanks so much for your support, and we're looking forward to serving you another delicious meal.

See you soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"My wife and I were here 20 years ago and loved it.  The food, the bad attitude of the staff, the cold drinks, the atmosphere oh and the food!  This time round we had our kids with us and we were salivating while we were walking there. I don't know if I had built it up too much over the years but it was just ok, certainly nothing special like I remember (and like I am sure it was back then).  We still enjoyed ourselves and were able to reminisce with our kids but without the great food it is a little harder to take the below average service.,Wow! After 20 years you still remembered the food and brought the whole family to enjoy it, Linc? That's such a compliment -- thanks so much! Although our food has evolved over the years, we know we are capable of serving a meal that surpasses your expectations so we hope you'll be back in for us to show you that and provide some recommendations. 

Hope to see you again, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Visited after reading the reviews and thought as our first taste of san fran it would be brilliant. Service was shocking throughout the whole meal, and not only rude but we had to get up twice to ask for things. Totally over rated,Your first taste of SF should be outstanding, and it sounds like we didn't quite meet your expectations on your visit. Our top priority here is to make sure that you get a delicious meal, so our servers work at an extremely fast pace to ensure this. Sometimes this tends to come off as rude, but I assure you that's never the intention. I hope you reconsider and give us another try in the future.

"If you want ambience or privacy, this is not the place. If you want to understand a fast fun food business with exceptional systems, this is the place. The menu is simple, the service brusque and easy to understand. The wine list had two choices of white and two of red. I chose the fried eggplant and the chicken sesame house special. Both were exceptional. The eggplant was soft and moist with the finest crispy skin, smothered with a fantastic chilli black bean sauce. The appetisers and entrees were served at the same time which meant dinner was a shared feast. This is not a place to linger, but a place for a fine simple well cooked meal seated at close quarters amongst other satisfied diners.,An unique experience with exceptional food, Diana, it sounds like you really get us! Efficiency is important in order for you to get your meal in a timely manner, but equally as important is serving you great food. From the fried eggplant to the chicken, we're glad to hear you had an exceptional meal, and we're looking forward to your next visit!

"One word.........."" disgusting""......
I have never commented on trip advisor before, but never have I felt so disgusted by the customer service!!!
We were ushered to a table like ""cattle"" , virtually sat on a guy's lap whom I had never met!!!!
Menus were thrown at us with a disgruntled stare, when I politely asked if I could substitute the sweet potatoe for rice!!!! Got a grunt, saying ""no""!!!!!
The main course was slammed in front of us before our starters had arrived, and I got some sort of grunt, when I asked again politely if we could possibly enjoy our starters before our main!!! Needless to say my request got rejected and our main courses were then ice cold and soggy!!!
The only attention and some sort of communication we got, that is if grunting and rolled eyes is communication in customer service, was when the bill came!! I asked them to split a large bill so I could leave a cash tip as my friends were paying by card.... the waiter stood behind me informing me about the service charge and tip, and I politely asked him three times could he give me some time to sort out the maths!!!!
On my fourth attempt I said to be honest I'm not very happy to leave such a large tip, and removed the generous amount to a standard amount!!!!!
Couldn't quite believe when he shouted "" get out, get out"", and put his hand onto my arm!!!!!
Never ever have I felt so disgusted about a so-called restaurant, I believe inmates in a prison would be treated with more dignity!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Getting everyone seated in a timely manner is very important to us, Drea, and we want to ensure that you receive prompt service. Along with this, we absolutely want you to feel respected. It can sometimes not feel that way due to our servers working at a very fast pace, but I assure you that's never the intention. I hope you reconsider and give us another try in the future.

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"After getting recommended this place, and looking at the reviews, me and my friends thought we would try it. All I can say is DON'T!!
Absolutely disgusting service! After being tutted at for asking for one more minute to look at the menu, we ordered our food. 
The mains came before the starters, we asked if we could have the starters first, in which we was told everything was coming out! So no point in ordering a ""starter!!"" 
The food was basically thrown onto the table. 
As for paying, it would have been as good to have as much attention round us through the meal!!! 
All they want is to treat you awful and want tipping for it!!! Not how it works!! 
Good luck if you want to try here!!!,Dining with us should be an enjoyable experience, Charlotte, and it's very important to us to serve you delicious food as promptly as possible. I understand you didn't receive the relaxing time you were expecting and want to assure you that our intention is simply to serve you in a timely manner. We hope for another opportunity to leave a positive impression on you and your friend in the future.

Sincerely,

"Myself and a few friends visited after a recommendation from a local bar tender. We had a short queue outside which is always a good sign and were seated after about 10 minutes. 
We were placed on the end of a table next to a family, our chairs were so close to the people behind that one of my friends actually had to move to let the family out when they had finished their meal, you really are squeezed in. Right from the start everything was basically thrown at you, the plates were slammed down with cutlery & napkins on top for you place out yourself, the drinks order was hurriedly taken and when we asked for a few extra minutes to make our choices an unsatisfactory look was given to us. 

The food came out quickly, normally a good thing however one of the main courses arrived before one of our starters. We politely told the waiter that we hadn't got all of our starters yet and could the main dish be taken back to the kitchen,  we were told all your food is coming. We asked again that the main be taken away and the rest delayed but it fell on deaf ears and the rest of the main courses arrived within minutes - all bar the rice. We then had to wait nearly 10 minutes before we could get anyone's attention to ask for the rice to go with our mains which were starting to go cold. 

The food in my opinion was ok, it was nice it was by no way the best food I have ever tasted but I found it pleasant, some of my friends really didn't rate it at all. 

I get that this might just be a different way of doing things to what we are used to but at no point was a smile given to us by any of the staff, we were never asked is everything ok with your food, never offered anymore drinks, basically they wanted you in and out as quickly as possible. I have work in the service industry and I know it can get busy but that is not an excuse to give bad customer service. 

The final straw and the main reason why I have given it one star was when we paid the bill. We spilt the cheque some paid cash some paid on card. When the card receipts were handed back the man who had barely said anything all night said ""service is not included"" we know, thanks for pointing that out though and he said it a few times, he then stood over us and watched while we signed our receipts. Now it had already been agreed by the party that some of them were leaving the tip in cash as they'd had alcohol and others hadn't, we had even asked the guy to change a larger note to be able to do this. When we handed our card receipts back he said again, ""no, service is not included"" when he saw that no tip had been left on the cards. We then told him that we were leaving a cash tip, ""oh ok"" was the reply he then stood over us while we were sorting this out. That was it, totally unacceptable behaviour, rude and intrusive. The friends who were leaving the tip couldn't believe the awful customer service we were receiving, up until that point we were leaving a decent tip, as we understood that perhaps we are just used to a different way of doing things. We left a small tip which because the man was standing right over us saw straight away he then said ""No, not enough, you need to leave at least $xx"" to which a friend said not for the level of customer service we have received. The man then shouted at us to ""get out"" that we did and we will be staying out.,I truly appreciate you and your friends coming by our place, Kevin, and I'm so sorry to hear that you didn't enjoy your experience with us. Like you mentioned, we do things a little differently here. Our place has community tables, and our staff serves a high volume of guests at any given moment. Our top priority is to make sure that everyone gets seated quickly so that they can enjoy a yummy meal. We certainly never mean to come off as rude.

I do want to take a moment to apologize for the miscommunication when you were paying. I know we can do better, and I hope you reconsider giving us another chance so that we can show you that.

"We saw the reviews on Trip Advisor, and looked forward to dining here. Customer service, on this visit, was quite poor, somewhat brusque, and we never heard any words of welcome, thanks, or any inquiry if we were enjoying our meals. 
Staffing seemed most inadequate for the customer volume. 
Took a while to get menus, then we were served entrees separately, while seeing some customers who arrived later served before us.
Ordered the Scallops Tower entree, as recommended by the wait staff, and received three single scallops, each one on a slice of lemon, and then on a slice of eggplant, served on a modest bed of shredded cabbage or lettuce. Hardly worth the $15 price. Another fish entree was fine, and tasted quite good. 
Had to go to the desk to request condiments, and later to get the check. 
There is no allocated street parking, just as in most of Chinatown. 
Used the lavatory and it was not clean, with plenty of containers of soap or other chemicals in the room, and graffiti
This was a single visit, but that the lavatory was in as bad shape as it was, clearly not the result of neglect over a few days, did not inspire confidence. We often give places a second chance, sometimes a third, but the impression we were left with will keep  us from returning. There are plenty of other, much better options in Chinatown, as well as outside Chinatown. 
Please note if you find this review helpful.,Thanks for coming by our place, although it's disappointing to hear you didn't enjoy your experience with us as much as we would've liked. Like you mentioned, our place is quite popular, and our staff's top priority is making sure that everyone gets seated as quickly as possible to enjoy a yummy meal. We apologize if that came off as rude, but that certainly is never our intention. 

We also want to address the bathrooms and apologize that they weren't in tip-top shape. We do clean them throughout the day, and we'll do our best to double our efforts to keep them spic and span during our lunch and dinner rushes. You mentioned that you often give a place at least two tries, and we hope you'll reconsider and give us the chance to show you what we're truly capable of.

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"The food here was very good. What they did they did well. This does mean that many dishes that you would expect to be available aren't. The description of the dishes isn't that good either. We both looked at the menu and couldn't decide what we wanted but we were surrounded by people who had amazing looking dishes on their tables. We did eventually order the fried rice (enough for 2), the chicken and chops. They were really good. The not so good was the service. The food is almost thrown on the table. The waiters don't speak particularly good English and will just walk away if they don't know what you're asking them. The meal was very reasonable at $25 pp.,Thanks for coming by our place, and I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed your meal with us, Peter! Next time you're in, don't hesitate to ask for suggestions -- we love making sure that you enjoy the yummiest meal possible.

"We found this restaurant on TA amongst all the hundreds of others in Chinatown. The queue out of the door was encouraging as to the quality of the food as most of the customers were locals. Everything was fabulous, food, atmosphere and great value for money in a very expensive city. The only negative was that we paid cash and had to ask three times for the change, the server not happy that we had only left 15% tip!,We're so glad you had a fabulous experience with us, Simon! It's wonderful to know we were able to offer you a terrific meal while you were visiting San Francisco, and the next time you're here, we hope you'll come back for round two.

"We wanted some good Chinese food while in San Francisco.  After all, there city is almost half Chinese so there must be some good restaurants.  We asked a few guides and our hotel and they said there were plenty of good Chinese restaurants.  However, none of them were in China Town.  House of Nanking came up a few times so we tried it.  We walked there and didn't have reservations but got seated within 2-3 minutes.  It was fairly early but still busy.  One caveat is they will seat you with other people if there are chairs open at their table.  Luckily, we got a window seat with just 2 chairs so yay for us.  Service is fast but don't expect them to stand and talk with you since they have a lot to do apparently.  We started with a chowder with chicken in it.  Great taste and very filling.  Split the chowder bowl since there is plently.  I had the sesame chicken and it was very tasty.  My wife had some tofu broccoli concoction that I tried to avoid but she said it was very good.  The portions are huge, like a lot of Chinese restaurants, so you don't need to order a lot of things.  Overall, I would say this was the best Chinese food that I have had but then again I have never been to China.  I do recommend and would repeat.,We're so glad so many people recommended our place to you! Like you mentioned, we can be quite busy, but our top priority is making sure you get the yummiest meal possible, so it's wonderful to know you and your wife both enjoyed your meal with us. If you're ever in San Franciso again, we look forward to sharing another meal together. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"We'd seen the House of Nanking on a travel show.  Their ideas sparked an interest so we decided to give it a try. Instead of having lunch, we opted for a couple of appetizers.  We shared shrimp packets and fried dumplings.  Both were covered with sauce which we would have preferred on the side.  The items were nicely crisp and from what we could tell - flavorful.,We're so glad the Travel Show led you here, and it's good to know that you enjoyed the shrimp packets and fried dumplings. Next time you're here, we hope to find something on the menu that you'll be an even bigger fan of.

"We had the sesame chicken and the calamari and there were great. The calamari was perfect, great flavor and cooked perfect. The food is reasonably priced and a fun place to eat.,It's awesome to know that the sesame chicken and calamari hit the spot! Come back again anytime.

"Went on a Friday night, early-ish (6:30pm) and managed to get a table right away though the restaurant was already mostly packed and the line for a table began right afterwards. Definitely order the potstickers and peashoot salad to start. The sesame chicken is a must.,We're so glad you made it by our place, and it's even better to know that we didn't disappoint.

"I am not familiar with the Nanjing cuisine, we chanced upon meeting the owner as his doorway.  As soon as he heard that we were 1st timer at his restaurant, took away our menu and  suggested that he will recommend a few dishes for lunch.  We had the egg roll and a very unique and very appetizing fish noodle soup and ""home brewed iced tea"".

The location was in the heart of Chinatown, very very touristy and lots of touts looking for customers,  We can't help but to be afraid that you will be ""fleeced"" as a 1st time tourist.

But NO, the meal was honest, unpretentious and to say the least delicious, all for under $30 before gratuity.  We felt very welcomed at the House of Nanking.

PS: Head Chef's daughter is a 1x winner of Chopped aka Celebrity Chef!,We're so glad you felt welcome here, and it's wonderful to know that we were able to take good care of you! Come back anytime.

"Well, this was certainly the most interesting eating experience I think we've ever had. It was a rainy March day when we visited Chinatown and we knew we wanted to eat lunch there, so we looked on Trip Advisor (naturally) for a place to eat. House of Nanking was rated well, and it was right near where we parked, so we went for it. 

When you walk in, it's a little disconcerting. The tables are sort of jumbled together and there's a lot of stuff sort of ""sitting around,"" like beer and pop cases, and other cases of food needed for service at a restaurant. We had 5 in our party, which is large for this tiny establishment, so the hostess booted some employees off a table who were hand making some appetizers. 

It was a little awkward, but once we were seated, we were taken care of by none other than Peter Fang himself, who walked up as we were looking at our menus and, upon finding out we were newbies, took all of our menus away and said he would bring out some dishes for us. LOL!! Since we were in Chinatown, and since he's the owner/chef, we were super cool with it - how fun is that? They brought out several appetizers, then three dishes. The waitress sort of slammed it down on the table, announcing, ""PORK!"" , then ""CHICKEN!"" , then ""BEEF!"" with each progression. We don't even know what we ate, but we ate it all and it was all delicious! We especially enjoyed the appetizer that looked like a square pillow and was deep fried. I don't know what it was but we all loved it. I also enjoyed my beer mug of hot tea, which had a tea ball in it that unfurled into something that looked like it came from deep within the sea.

So - I'm sorry I can't recommend any particular dishes as I'm not sure what we ate, but regardless, you'll enjoy whatever they put in front of you at the House of Nanking.,Thanks for being an adventurous eater and letting Peter cook you up something special! It's wonderful to know that none of it disappointed. If you ever find yourself in the neighborhood again, we hope you'll come by for more deliciousness.

"Food was very good: dumplings, ""tower scallops"" (don't expect a ""tower"" - I got 3, but they were good), sesame chicken, etc. Service was just ok - not a warm and fuzzy bunch for sure. And I agree, it is a ""hole in the wall"", but we like those. If you don't like hole in the wall places, try this for lunch.,We're so glad your meal was able to hit the spot, Harry! Making sure you receive a tasty meal is our top priority here, and we hope you're able to join us for more deliciousness soon.

"This place is a hole in the wall, it's very simple but the food was amazing. Do not expect comfortable tables and upscale service. Try to ignore the water cups and ask for a can of soda.
We ordered several dishes to share. First, we got steamed dumplings for appetizer. Delicious.We then ordered the chicken Nanking (awesome), the scallop tower (only 3 scallops come in the dish - delicious), the sliced pork dish (good, not outstanding), the house pasta (nobody cared about it), spicy eggplant (yum!). Overall, we all agreed that the food was excellent, but the water cups are scary.,It sounds like you tried a little bit of everything when you came by, Limao, and it's wonderful to know you all thought our dishes were excellent. Making sure you get a yummy meal is our top priority, and we hope you'll come back for more soon.

"This place was recommended to us and was arguably our favorite meal of or trip. We stopped in for lunch in the middle of the week. It wasn't too crowded. We sat down and our server asked the four of us if we had been there before, when we said no, she asked what we liked/didn't like. She then said she would bring out four dishes four us that she thought we would like. While this was a little intimidating, the food was amazing. We loved everything she brought us. Make sure you get the calamari and the crackling shrimp. I took a picture of our receipt just so we would remember what we ate.,Wow! We're so glad we could be one of your favorite spots on your trip. It's wonderful to know that our staff was able to take care of you, and I'm so glad you were a fan of the calamari and crackling shrimp. If you're ever in San Franciso again, we hope you'll come by for round two.

"I was on my own in San Fran. Had been on the hop on and off buses all day. I knew I wanted to hit China town for lunch. I walked and I googled restaurants to eat at. As I was headed to what I thought was a great place to eat, I stumbled upon The House of Nanking! Y'all !! This place is delicious!!  I had steamed pork dumplings and a Tsingtao beer to start. I added chicken lettuce wraps because I was starving!  All of it wS fantastic. I was told a long time ago "" eat at the places that are busy and you won't go wrong"". That old saying is true and yummy I might add. Try the place out! It's good! Promise.,We're so glad you stumbled upon us, Kalyse! It's terrific to know you thought the pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wrap were delicious, and if you're ever in town again, we hope you'll come on by.

"Great Chinese food in Chinatown. Award winning food. The food is fresh, waiter staff are prompt. Dumplings are to die for and home made noodles are fantastic. Kids enjoyed everything also.

"We walked past this place by chance and took a gamble on it. It was popular and very minimalistic. The food was tasty and the portions were huge!!!... We ordered too much but didn't feel so bad as it was so cheap. Highly recommend this place for the food and felt we had a Chinese experience. There was none of usual fussy friendly service but it was quite refreshing! We loved the basic no frills experience and would come again especially for the food.,We're so glad you stumbled upon our place, and it's terrific to hear that your gamble paid off. Thanks for giving us your recommendation, and come back to see us anytime. -Kathy, Manager"
"We visited this restaurant tonight and have never been as rushed in our lives! 
We were told what to eat, the glasses brought to our table were dirty, but the worst issue was the toilet :-(.
The restaurant was due to close 9pm but basically the plates were taken away when we hadn't finished and we were demanded to pay!
We decided to not pay for service as we hadn't had any!! Give this place a miss.,Thank you so much for coming by our place, although I'm truly disappointed to hear that you didn't enjoy your experience with us.
Our top priority here is to make sure that you get a delicious meal with us. To ensure this, our servers work at an extremely fast pace. I promise you that we never intend to come off as rude. 

We do want to take a moment to assure you that we follow all health codes regulations, and we promise to step our game up even more to ensure our bathrooms are always spic and span. We know we can do better, and we hope you'll consider giving us another chance to show you that.

"Sure, it looks a bit like a canteen, the food is on your table before you know it, the service is ... well let's call it 'unconventional' and it might not be the most romantic meal you ever had. 

But somehow this doesn't matter as the food is just out of this world (of course, it's Chinese)!

Tip: the soup serves actually two so don't make the mistake to order too many appetizers. But than again, the appetizers and mains do basically arrive at the same time (in fact whenever the dishes are ready).,Our food is always our first priority, Jurgen, so it's fantastic to hear that you've been consistently pleased with your dishes here. As for our service, we always try to have our guests served as quickly as possible, as we know everyone comes hungry, and we serve many people a day. With that in mind, I thank you for your support and look forward to having you back again soon.

"I suggested this place to family members who were in town and they absolutely loved it! We ordered a small feast including chow mein, fried rice, and sesame chicken.

"Readers of TripAdvisor, I can't tell you enough how wonderful this restaurant was. It's going to take a long time before I can get over it and enjoy other Chinese restaurants again. The food was fresh and unique to the location, and the flavors were spectacular without being overwhelming. I loved the sesame chicken and the wonton soup. The hot tea was terrific as well. Enjoyed the feel of the place and the clear camaraderie felt among customers. I've never been to a place like this. A must visit!,Wow! We're so glad you enjoyed your visit with us so much, Courtney. We hope you'll be able to come by again for more sesame chicken and wonton soup.

"We stopped in as we were walking through China town and the ratings were good. The place is small. The chef came to our table and told us to trust him and he would order for us. That is not something I would typically try, but I felt like we needed an adventure. Anyway we got several dishes I would not have otherwise tried and I thought they were all great. The service was very quick. We really enjoyed our Chinatown meal,It's terrific to hear that you stumbled upon us while in Chinatown, and it's even better to know that our chef was able to take care of you and that we didn't disappoint.

"Enjoyed a nice and quick lunch on a Monday afternoon after our walking tour of Chinatown. We were recommended this place by a friend and our guide confirmed it was a nice spot. Food came out fast. Some of the reviews said portion sizes were small and while some of the dishes like the scallops were small, the chow mein was a huge plate. We shared 3 plates between 2 of us and it was enough.,We're so glad you checked us out after exploring Chinatown! It's terrific to hear you enjoyed the chow mein. Next time you're in the neighborhood, we hope you'll pop in.

"House of Nanking is situated at 919 Kearny St., San Francisco.
Heard about this restaurant so decided to give it a try. The décor inside and outside is made to look like ancient China. A bit outdated and dull atmosphere. It has communal long table seating.
We ordered the hot & sour chicken soup, wonton soup, Nanking chicken, musha beef with wrapper, sautéed peashoot and steamed rice. Portions were reasonable.
The service was very fast as if the food had been prepared for a busy crowd.
A bit disappointed with the meal and expected much better for a Chinese restaurant that we had experienced. A bit of a letdown and we find the beef very salty and not to our liking. I would have rated them higher if not for the salt and dull setting.
Most likely not coming back as there are better ones.,Thanks for coming by our place and trying us out, although it's disappointing to hear you didn't love your experience with us. Our in-house recips are Chinese fusion based on the history of the restaurant and requests from our customers. If you give us another shot, we know we can find something on the menu that'll really impress you.

"This is the worst Chinese restaurant I had ever been. The portion is very small. My son felt sick after the dinner.,This is quite concerning to read, Hang, and I have to say I'm shocked -- I never hear feedback like this. I'm not sure what you tried that you were unhappy with, but I usually hear quite the opposite about our portions -- they're quite generous. As far as your son feeling sick, I'm not sure how that could have happened. We take our food prep very seriously and take great care to ensure it's always cooked properly in a clean kitchen with fresh ingredients. I'll look into this, but to put it simply, this really doesn't sound like us.

"House of Nanking is a MUST visit for amazing Chinese food in San Francisco. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu -- but the sesame chicken is by far my favorite. Another go to is their grilled calamari or pork potstickers. The restaurant is small and can be packed. Sometimes we have visited and there are lines out the door. So, if you are dining during peak hours or on the weekend, be prepared just in case. Do not expect to be greeted with open arms and big smiles here. The service is typically quick and your food will be prepared right away, but the staff stay busy.,We're so glad you think we're a must visit, Lauren!

"We went to this restaurant based on other reviews.  The reviews said to be certain to have the Sesame Chicken, which we did, but the surprise gem was the spicy wonton soup!!! The spices were absolutely amazing and it was full of delicious filled wontons, as well as shrimp.  There is also a crispiness in the soup that made it an amazing non-typical wonton soup.  The restaurant itself is small, crowded (very popular), and unimpressive, but the food is great.,We're so glad you checked us out! You can't go wrong with the Sesame Chicken, but it's terrific to hear that the spicy wonton soup could be a surprise gem. Come back anytime.

"Thank you random chick in the street who directed us to House of Nanking. We walked in and saw nit full of people eating food we had never seen the likes of previously. The table they sat us next to had beautiful entrees--so we ordered what they had- nanking chicken and scallop towers. It was tasty, hot, and prompt without breaking the budget. 60 bucks for 4 entrees. Not fancy, not pretentious, just great, different Chinese food than what you can get in middle america.,Yes, thank you indeed to the kind stranger who directed you our way! We're so glad we could offer you something different and delicious. Next time you're in San Franciso, we hope you'll come by.

"We went here on the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel while on vacation in SF. We wanted a taste of Chinese food, and she suggested this one. We arrived and at first glance were hesitant to go in... it was a 'hole in the wall' type restaurant, and as soon as we opened the door it was evident this was a real neighborhood place, authentic chinese food with no ambiance. We had actually made a reservation, but it was obviously not necessary - this was not a place that one made reservations at. We were actually seated right away, and before we had a chance to take a breath the waitress was trying to take our order! I had read on the reviews that they turned the tables over quickly but this was a bit too much. Anyway, I politely told her we had just sat down. She was actually fine with that, brought us some requested tea, and only came back when she saw we were ready. The tea was served in big glass mugs (almost like a beer mug) rather than traditional tea cups, but the tea was excellent, and very hot! There was a blooming flower inside, coming out of the wrapped tea leave holder which was pretty cool.
We ordered Onion Rice cakes ( A bit too onion-y for our tastes), wonton soup (fantastic!!!), chinese pork dumplings (Terrific!) and egg rolls (mostly pork, good flavor but not what we were used to). We also split an entree of their special sesame chicken (very flavorful) served with white rice (clumpy, not hot, but serviceable). Considering what we got, the bill was very reasonable. It took a bit of time for our server to give us our check, but we sure didn't feel rushed like we had initially. She was very pleasant, chatted with us a bit, and was very efficient throughout. In fact the other server that brought our food was very nice as well. We noted a line of people waiting outside to get in, soon after we had sat down. Most waited 15-20 minutes to get a table, but the line kept forming. The place stayed busy but they moved people along nicely. As mentioned we never felt rushed after the initial encounter.
If you want authentic chinese food in a typical neighborhood restaurant in Chinatown, we would definitely recommend it! There are lots of restaurants in the area of course, but I would not hesitate to return.,Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome and detailed review, Randtor! We're so glad your hotel concierge pointed you our way and that you enjoyed your meal with us. Hope to see you again soon.

"This is the 2nd time I've eaten here and it will be the last. I thought I'd give it another try seeing how my first experience was ""so-so"". I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars because the Sesame Chicken dish my wife got was pretty good. Other than that, the food is average and service is horrible. The staff was inattentive and rude which ruined the whole experience. I have a choice when it comes to spending good money on dining and I chose not to patronize a place that doesn't take care of their guests in the slightest. There are lots of great places in Chinatown. Stay way from this tourist trap. Choose wisely.,Thanks for checking us out, and we're so glad you and your wife enjoyed the sesame chicken.

"This place had a line when we arrived for a later dinner...always a good sign. We were seated quickly-based on other reviews my expectation of friendly service was low and we were rewarded with efficient service but friendly chit chat isn't at this place. They are focused on getting you in and out quickly if you are looking for a place to relax and eat slowly-this isn't it. What you will get is good food with no frills. We had the rice chowder-very good both the chicken and tofu versions and the sesame chicken, which was good but like I've had other places nothing unique. I enjoyed my blossoming green tea. In summary, if you need a quick dinner that you know will be consistent and good-try this place.,Thanks for coming by our place, JL, and it's great to know that we are always able to provide you with a quick and good meal.

"Read many reviews and a great article listing this quaint restaurant as one of the best Chinese restaurants in San Francisco.  So I went.  Had the famous sesame chicken (pretty good, I must say) and the melt in your mouth calamari.  Honestly, the calamari was the most disgusting I've had and almost tasted as if it was on the verge of spoilage.  I couldn't eat it.  I am an avid seafood lover - my parents had a seafood market when I was a child -- this squid was not fresh.  I didn't say anything because the server was rude to begin with and there was a big argument or some type of chaos going on in the back area with people speaking in Chinese - just didn't want to interrupt.  But the other food was good, they gave a great portion of flowering tea which I absolutely loved.  Don't order the squid/calamari,Thanks for coming by our place and trying us out! It's disappointing to hear you weren't impressed with the calamari, but we're so glad you enjoyed your sesame chicken and flower tea.

"We ate here with the family on a Saturday night.  Get here early as it gets packed.  We ordered Fried Pork Egg rolls   - Delicious good flavor and ton of pork, Eggplant In Chili Garlic Sauce - WOW one of the best dishes that we had, Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken - ordered 2 dishing and our kids wanted more, Fried Onion cakes - also very good, Ginger Garlic Poached Scallop - cooked to perfection and tasted great, Spice Garlic Beef - was good but not the best of the dishes that we ordered.  The service was fast and no frills.  They got us in as a group of 8 fairly quick and our meal came out with a quickness.

"Great place to eat. Tasty food delivered very quickly. Beware of the portion sizes - double what we get in England !  The restaurant itself is very basic in its decor. That is more than offset by the food which, by San Francisco standards, is very well priced.

"Went here on a recommendation, the fact it was busy and we got the last table we thought was a good sign...fried rice was really nice, other dishes were okay, food came out fast which made our kids happy, but....there was not a friendly hello or smile from the staff, it seemed about getting us in and out quick so they could fill the table again, entrees came before appetisers and presentation was a bit sloppy with sauce splashed around the edge of the plates, so we tipped accordingly (which we actually thought was still quite generous) - well they rudely returned our credit card slip and insisted it was not enough tip and tried to tell us it was a requirement to give a certain size tip! Would not go here again.,Sophie, it's disappointing you didn't enjoy your meal. Getting great food out to the table is our top priority, so we bring each dish out as soon as its ready.

Since we do cook everything fresh, we bring it out once it's ready -- that way it's extra delicious. Hope to see you back soon for another lunch!

"We were walking through a local park and asked a local couple for a recommendation for dinner. They raved about this place and I can see why. The line outside was incredible, but we'll worth the wait. Great for family style dining and had the coolest blooming teas. Tried 4 different entrees with my family and each were delicious.,Elizabeth, we're all about making sure the great food is worth the wait -- and we try to make the wait as short as possible. I'm excited you enjoyed all four of the meals you ordered.

"They run a very efficient place with little wait time for anything.  Wait staff knows the process well, after you are seated.  Menu, water, utensils all in rapid order.  We ordered items after looking at our neighbor tables.  Every dish was good nothing outstanding.  Good value for the low price.,While I'm happy you enjoyed your dishes, I wish we'd really blown you away with our bold flavors. I hope you'll give us another chance to show you the outstanding meal we're known for.

"We we hungry and our eyes were even more hungry. We ordered about 6 things off the menu and it all was FABULOUS! The dumplings were my favorite, but the melt-in-your-mouth calamari were just wonderful. Would be more than happy to go again when I'm back in San Fran.,We're all about making sure everything is fabulous! You can't beat delicious dumplings and wonderful calamari.

"This place came highly recommended to us so we brave the rain to come here. I wouldn't say I'm disappointed but I'm definitely not impressed.

We ordered potstickers, fried rice and special nanking sesame chicken. The potstickers ate deep fried not the gyoza types. The rice is my favourite among the 3 dishes. The chicken is way too sweet.,We wish we would have exceeded your expectations. While I'm happy you enjoyed the rice, I'm surprised the sesame chicken didn't knock it out of the park. It sounds like we must have had a rare off night in the kitchen. Hopefully you'll give us another chance to show you the all-around great meal we're known for.

"We were visiting San Fransisco on our way back to New Zealand and came here on the recommendation of our taxi driver. The food was amazing. Best fried rice and chow mein. However we were surprised after paying and leaving a tip that we were told that hadn't left enough. Kinda puts you off as I know that there is a usual rate for good service and we left what we though was fair for a place slamming your food down and not waiting fast enough to get you out to get the turnover.,It's great knowing your driver recommend our place and that the food lived up to your expectations. Sorry about any confusion with the service at the end of the meal. Our servers need to work quickly, which can sometimes come across a bit brusque, but that's never their intention. We want you to enjoy all parts of your experience.

"Based on reviews we dined at this restaurant and were not disappointed. I had the tofu and broccoli with black bean sauce. I went back two nights later for the same dish. I recommend this place.,Living up to those high expecations is what we're all about, so this is fantastic to see. It speaks volumes knowing you came back two nights lagter for another helping of the tofu and broccoli.

"My family and I had an awesome dining experience.  

The chef greeted us at our table where he proceeded to ask us for any dietary restrictions and food preferences.   Next thing we knew he was off to make us a lunch of his choosing.

He nailed it.  The food was great (chicken, fish, vegetables, shrimp).

What a great dining experience, we will definitely come back when we are in S.F. again.,Chef does an amazing job of knowing the perfect dish to cook up, doesn't he? I'm delighted to know he nailed it. It sounds like you got to try a nice variety of dishes, and we'll looking forward to seeing you back for more in the future.

"After looking online for a good place to eat in Chinatown, this came up as highly-rated so we decided to check it out. After reading that the service could be rather rude, we were prepared - but of course we found they were just fine and were not rude at all. We ordered the house noodles, the melt in your mouth calamari and wonton soup. All of the dishes were good and it served two of us nicely. The food was good but I don't know if I'd rave about it. We definitely enjoyed it though!,Great choices with the house noodles, calamari, and wonton soup. I'm happy you enjoyed everything. Hopefully you'll get the chance to come back and try our sesame chicken -- I know that will impress!

Take care,

"Used Trip Advisor to find this little restaurant. (Bus stop right across the road) Everything we ate was delicious- special mention must be made of the Melt in your mouth Calamari- totally lived up to its name. Sesame chicken and Steamed scallops were outstanding! It was so nice to find a place that served tasty food and wasn't overly expensive. Decent sized serves, friendly & super fast service. No frills. Can see why the place was packed with locals. I'd eat here regularly if I lived here too!,We're all about making sure all the dishes are delicious, Laura! There's really no better meal than the calamari or sesame chicken. Glad you enjoyed the food and service.

"In 2006 the restaurant was very basic. The attitude of the staff varied from openly hostile to quite rude to total indifference, but strangely this seemed comical and made it a place to remember with fondness. The food was very very good. Ten years on and the restaurant has been updated, the staff were more tuned in to customer service and the food was still very very good. Well worth a visit.,I'm glad you enjoyed your most recent meal. We're all about topping expectations, so it's great we were able to do that.

"Food is good but defiantly not the best in China town. Restaurant is full all the time. The floor and especially the kitchen is dirty. You can see it when you pay by card. Products/plate are on the wooden floor and full dirt everywhere.,Michel, I'm happy you enjoyed the flavor, but wish we'd really knocked it out of the park.

"This place is famous and the food lives up to that. It's a tiny place in Chinatown, SF. Expect a wait unless you arrive at a odd time of the day. 
Being a tourist and not coming here often- we did not know what to order so we did what was advised and let the waitress order for us which she seemed very natural at doing. She handed us a large menu and we certainly could have picked from that but then she arrived and said ""been here before? Ah- you like chicken? or you like beef?"" we kind of went with that and 8 minutes later we had appetizers and entrees and WOW. 
Other than it being fried chicken and some beef and broccoli I have really no idea what else we were eating but it was delicious. 
We really enjoyed this adventurous style of eating but might not be so great for the pickier eaters. 
Prices were moderate to low- service was fast and they don't like you lingering at the table.,Topping expectations is excatly what great Chinese food should do, so this was wonderful to read! It's amazing how good the staff is at knowing the perfect dishes for you, isn't it? 

See you next time you're in San Francisco,

"This was our second visit here, the first four years ago, and we returned based on our first experience. We were not disappointed. 
There was a line out front in the rain at 7 pm. People happily waited as the food is worth it. The place is tight, and you will sit next to people you don't know. Make a friend and dive right in. 
We had the hot and sour soup to start. Not your usual hot and sour, but amazing and you should have it. Fried dumplings with peanut sauce. Steamed dumplings ( amazing) 
Sesame chicken was the best ever.we had a beef dish I can't remember the name of that was incredible. Bottom line, everything here is delicious and it's worth the wait if there is one.,James, it's great you enjoyed your first meal so much you made sure to stop back four years later. Glad we lived up to the expectations the second time, too! Tasty choice with the sesame chicken -- you can't go wrong with it.

"We were told the food here is amazing and have to admit it was really good. Whether it was the best Chinese we ever had... not sure but way up there for sure. And you have to add in the fact that you get the Chinese eating experience in a very authentic way. We were there when they opened so had to walk carefully across the very very wet floor that had just been washer. The owner (?) barked at you for where to sit - and it wasn't just us as we heard her barking at other visitors, telling them where to sit. And she yelled a lot at her cooks in the back - a lot - and loudly. And the waitress sort of threw the plates on our table, leaving us to identify who they went to. I think they did want to move us through quickly. But a great experience! We didn't mind a bit. The place filled quickly and there was a line out front when we left. We had blooming hot tea - lovely - shrimp with mushrooms, eggplant, dim sum... all very good. I thought the sesame chicken was more sesame than chicken but my family liked it. We were so full we wound up walking to Fishermen's Wharf from there! Very fun.,Best Chinese food you've ever had -- now that's what I love seeing, Mary! We're all about getting delicious food out to you quickly. We serve many people, so our staff has to work at a quick pace, but it's never their intention to come across as brusque. I'm glad the whole family enjoyed!

"For the high expectations, this place was below average of the many meals we ate in Chinatown.

"The food was fantastic here... Many years ago before the chef/owner got a lot of press and the place got turned into crap tourist trap. You'll wait forever, get hustled to your table, the 'owner/chef' will come to your table without any menus and offer to do something special for your table, all you have to do is pick the proteins and he'll take care of the rest. Such a crock, what comes out is a bunch of cloyingly sweet fried food that is barely at the level of Panda Express. If you go, insist on ordering off the menu, but so many great Chinese restaurants no need for the hassle,Matthew, your review is very surprising to read. We've worked hard to craft the perfect dishes. Our recipes have developed from requests from the customers and the history of our restaurant.

"Amazing, tasty, delicious Chinese food in the centre of China Town in San Francisco. You have to try the dumplins, the soups, the pork... the chicken. Everything is delicious.

Stop back soon. -Kathy, Manager"
"A terrible experience start to finish. We were seated quickly and given the options of 'chicken, beef or shrimp'. We didn't get to see a menu. The chicken was standard sticky takeaway fayre and the shrimp was dry and weird. Served with mushrooms and covered in pepper. It was remiscient of the food I would cook as a small child. We ate half the food and were hurried out in ten minutes. Worst experience of san francisco of the entire trip. I would rather have lice than eat here again.,Scott, a great meal of Chinese food is all about topping expectations with delicious dishes. On that note, we train our staff -- both in the kitchen and on the floor -- to deliver tasty meals. Getting you great food is our top priority, so we make sure to use quality, fresh ingredients.

"We were visiting China town and wanted to try Chinese food in the area. Searched for this restaurant in google and found good reviews so decided to try it, it was worth.

"I think it's overrated. Not as good as the rate. Some dishes is not like what says on the menu. For example, the tofu with preserved pork meat, they use sausage not the preserved pork. The spicy and sour  potato is really crap. So maximum I would give this restaurant 2.5 stars,I'm disappointed to hear that you got this impression, as we typically get a great response from our guests here. I do want to clarify that our menus are more based on Chinese fusion as we alter our recipes based on the history of our restaurant and feedback we receive from our customers. Based on this, I hope you can see that the dishes you tried are based on requests from our customers, and your feedback will be considered just the same. That said, I do hope you'll consider giving us another chance sometime -- we know that we can make a much better impression.

"The place is a crowded and a bit noisy, but overall the food is good.  The ""melt in your mouth crispy calamari"" was tough and despite my best efforts it never did melt in my mouth!  The sesame chicken was good, but the best entrée we had was the honey beef with bok choy, curry and garlic.  The beef was tender and the flavors were incredible.  We went back the next day for take-out of that entrée!  Overall this was a good find.,Happy to hear that you enjoyed your meal with us! It sounds like you ordered well -- the sesame chicken is a house favorite, and I'm glad you loved the honey beef with bok choy as well. We're all about a well prepared meal with unique flavors. As for the calamri, we'll certainly consider your feedback as we typically get a great response to that dish. With that in mind, I do hope you'll come back and see us again soon. We'd love to hear what you think of some other items on our menu!

"This was truly fantastic Chinese.  Known dishes, reasonably priced, but kicked up by the chef to have a level of quality and flavor beyond the typical Chinese restaurant.  Who would have thought Won Ton Soup, and Sesamee Chicken, could be so profoundly good?  and the melt-in-your-mouth Calamari was fantastic.  Got the recommendation from Big Bus tours.  Very glad we went,Thanks so much for deciding to give us a try, Richard! Great food is our top priority, and it's wonderful to hear that's shining through to our guests. I'm glad you enjoyed our unique takes on  the classics like wonton soup and sesame chicken, and I hope you'll come see us again if you're ever back in San Francisco.

"Tip 1. Get there early! Tip 2 if you get there and there is a line , don't make the mistake of getting out of that line to go next door to house of Xiang dumpling!  There is a sauce that only nan King makes for some of its dishes ( just ask or read description) that you crave and can't get satisfied unless you go back to nan King .
Consistently good for YEARS.  A favorite SF place,Thanks for this great review! It's wonderful to know you always have consistently great meals over the years you've been eating here. We're happy to be one of your favorite SF places. Hope to see you back for more of that Nanking sauce soon.

"The sesame chicken was SO GOOD. My bf liked his beef wraps and the pork egg rolls. I don't even know where to begin with the service and we aren't very picky lol. They brought his food wayyy before mine and took forever to get us the check. They weren't packed or anything, it was an off hour. They aren't really interested in serving anyone in a timely manner and the place is really dirty. I have to give 4 stars for the food though!,So glad our famous sesame chicken didn't disapoint, Kandi! About the order of the food, we want everything to come our warm and fresh, so we bring out the dishes as soon as they're ready.

"I was very disappointed in the is restaurant.  It was Cantonese cuisine but not very good.  The service was rushed and haphazard, and the food just adequate.  The eggplant was good, and so was the crispy chicken, but the beef tasted 'recycled' tough and bland.  A lot of it came cold.  The decor was early warehouse.  I have been to China and to may Chinese restaurants in my own hometown so am very aware of good Chinese fare.  This wasn't it.,Ruthie, as you can see from our reviews, we're known for our great flavors. Getting delicious food quickly to the table is our top priority. We bring the dishes out as soon as they're ready, so I'm surprised it didn't seem hot, fresh, and tasty. All of the food should have been just as good as the eggplant and chicken.

"My wife and I were there on vacation. A local resident we met near the Wharf recommended this place. We arrived right before the line started on the street. A gentleman who was also the owner came to take our order. We told him our story of why we were there and that we had walked from the Wharf to his location. He abruptly took our menus and proceeded to order on our behalf. Five courses later it was one of the best culinary experiences we have ever had.

"We had lunch at House of Nanking during the week. We each ordered the sesame chicken which was recommended in other reviews. The waitress encouraged us to have a different dish rather than two of the same entree. She recommended a shrimp dish. The sesame chicken was the best we have ever eaten and the shrimp dish was delicious too. I did not note the name of the shrimp dish but it was unique, featuring apples and pineapples in a tropical sauce with the shrimp.,There's not much better than a delicious meal of sesame chicken, Janeen. Thanks for coming to our place for it! It's so encouraging knowing the chicken was the best you've eaten. Hopefully you'll get to stop back for another order of it soon.

"The restaurant located in the heart of China Town was busy and yet the service was excellent. Six chair table seating is shared with others. The ambiance is what you would expect from a movie featuring Charles Boyer and Sidney Greenstreet. The food choices are good with large portions and excellent value. The wait staff is responsive and the food arrives as it is produced. The availability of an adequate Chinese beer selection and rare food selections was delightful. We had the fried egg plant with a savory flavor, Tower of Scallop, and Chow Mein noodles. Each were served on a plate of their own and was generous. The price for each item on the menu was in the $$ range with few items reaching $$$. We would return for more.,James, glad you enjoyed the service! Excelling is a word I love seeing describe our place. Great choice with the egg plant, scallops, and Chow Mein -- a nice and complimentary variety. Hopefully this means we'll see you back soon so we can give you a 5-star meal.

"Just came back from having dinner at House of Nanking.  I was alone, so I tried the Onion Pancake, Hot & Sour Soup, and (as everyone in the place seemed to be also) the Sesame Chicken.  I forgot to order the Hot and Sour with the Tofu (you can get it with either Tofu or Chicken) so mine came with the chicken.

The Hot and Sour Soup was really good, although a little different than the kind one usually gets, as it had many more vegetables in the broth as well as lovely large pieces of very tender chicken.  I guess I would classify it as more of a home style hot and sour.  Still with the classic hot and sour flavor - not quite as tangy as I have had at some places, but quite good and with absolutely no speck of that off aftertaste one gets in hot and sour soup from bad restaurants.  The bowl is pretty big (easily big enough for 2 or 3 for a starter) and they don't have a cup size, so gauge accordingly.

The onion pancake was also not quite like the kind I usually have had.  Rather than the scallion pancake I have often had where it is like a single pancake with scallions baked in, this one is a heaping mixture of what looked like both scallions and chopped onions, as well as some other flavors, which were fried up and then baked between two deliciously crispy layers of pancake, covered with some sweet peanut sauce.  It was a wonderful dish, again not like I expected, but as good as I could have asked for.

The sesame chicken was great, and this one was just as one would expect, crisp pieces of chicken with a great sesame and sauce coating.  However, it was served with these slices of fried (I think - maybe baked) sweet potato - not soft, but square shaped thin strips that were very firm yet not chewy.  The sweet potato was really a nice complement to the chicken.

So all in all a really nice meal - the menu has a good assortment of items, but not the 80 page version of everything like you see in so many chinese restaurants, just one page front and back.  It has a good selection, and based on what I saw on other plates, they all looked like quality homemade preparations.

The place is clean, but definitely a small place of cramped quarters.  I went at 5PM on a Tuesday and there was plenty of room in the restaurant so I didn't feel cramped at all, but it looks like from other reviews here it can get pretty crowded sometimes.  All in all a really nice meal.,Thanks for the kind words! I'm delighted to see you loved our sesame chicken so much. We've worked to perfect the recipe, so it's fantastic that you enjoyed the combination of the chicken with the sweet potato. Glad you liked everything from our food to our atmosphere. Hopefully that means we'll be seeing you again soon!

Until then,

"We had dinner here, the food was really good, the place itself is really dirty and unclean looking, the staff the most rude I've ever come across, from slamming the plates on the table and snapping at you demanding that you order. They were stopping people as they left yelling that they had not left enough money, wanting more money for tips... the staff are that rude I don't think they should be entitled to a tip. If you are prepared to eat good food in a poor atmosphere, however at reasonable prices this is the place for you! I'd try somewhere else before I came back again, as this is not a friendly and welcoming environment,Lizzie, while I'm glad you enjoyed your food, it's disappointing ot learn you didn't love the rest of your meal as much. I can assure you we take cleanliness seriously and are meticulous about maintaining food health and safety standards.

"We chose House of Nanking based on TripAdvisor reviews and very glad we did! I've never had Chinese that tasted so good!! My husband had the Sesame Chicken- the sweet potatoes that came with it was AMAZING, and I had the Tofu and broccoli. 
The food was very fast! 
Just know that if you wanted privacy, you probably won't get it. We were a party of 2 and shared a table with a single person. It wasn't terribly uncomfortable though and really the food made up for it!,It's great to know we lived up to your expectations! Great choice with the sesame chicken -- it can really brighten any day. Stop back the next time you're in town.

"We decided to have lunch her based on reports on TripAdvisor. The sesame chicken was great, the other dishes were oke, the octopus that melts in you mouth was not (and really overpriced). The people who were sitting to us, locals with guests from LA, said that the quality was't as good as before. Because it was so busy, people waiting outside for a table, the waitress decided that we were finished and gave us the check. When we wanted to pay, with a tip, she decided that the tip was not high enough... very rude! So that's why we won't recommend this restaurant.,Thank you for taking that chance on us, Mieke, but I'm sorry to see that you felt the experience was not quite as great as you had expected. We really do love what we do here, and we put a great deal of time and effort into creating the best menu possible -- it's certainly disappointing to know that our dedication to quality was not quite as apparent as we would have hoped. I'd also like to apologize if you felt this disrespected at any point in time -- I can assure you that this was never our intention.

"As per other reviews the service is snappy an quick, they are friendly but certainly give you no time to decide on what you would like to order. We had been looking so forward to this restaurant and we were disappointed as we didn't get time to take in the menu. We have lived in China and appreciate good Chinese food, this is more Shanghai Style with a lot of sweet sauce. The pork dumplings were authentic. 
It was certainly the busiest restaurant in the area so it's hitting the mark for a lot of people.,Thank you so much for joining us -- it's always a pleasure to share our menu with others who appreciate authenticty as much as we do. That being said, I apologize if you felt rushed at any point during your meal with us -- I can assure you that this was never our intention.

We had the sesame chicken, lettuce wraps, potstickers, honey shrimp, fried rice, and Lo Mein.   It was all great but the honey shrimp was the best.

"In line with some of the other reviews, this is a hilarious dining experience. It's probably the quickest meal we've ever had. The waitress efficiently ordered our food for us, before we'd really even looked at the menu (her choices were excellent, don't worry!). The food was with us in about 3 minutes, and the bill (circa $28 for a couple) followed moments later. And that was that. We'd been Nankinged.

The food really was excellent though, and if you take the experience for the hilarity it offers, rather than moaning about service, it's a good option for this expensive city!,Greg, we're all about really excellent food -- glad you agree! Thanks for the positive feedback. We'll look forward to seeing you back again soon.

"The place has lost a step over the years, but the food is still very tasty and reasonably priced. The place is small and even at 11:30 am was pretty full.,Nez, while I'm glad you still enjoy the food, I wish you were as impressed with the overall experience as much as you used to be. I know we can give you the great meal you'd come to expect next time you stop by.

"This place was absolutely fantastic! I went in with a group of four, and we were all reviewing the menu and ready to order the same thing, but when our waitress came over and heard we hadn't been there before, she basically ordered all different dishes for us, each more delicious than the next. We tried the sesame chicken, the pan fried pork, some kind of beef dish (I've looked at the menu a bunch of times, and couldn't for the life of me tell you what it was) and a noodle dish, and i honestly can not decide which was my favorite. Very flavorful, everything was cooked perfectly, just good all around. Definitely worth a try if you're in town!,What's absolutely fantastic is your review! I'm thrilled to know you all love our famous sesame and all the other dishes -- very flavor and perfectly cooked are such compliments.

"A group of 9 of us walked in unannounced. It was extremely busy and loud but they found a place for us right beside the kitchen. As we were trying to figure out the menu items, the manager came and asked if it was our first time there. When we said yes, she took our menus and told us she'd take care of us. She brought out 9 plates for our table to share. The food was absolutely fantastic and reasonably priced. I was so thankful that the decision-making was taken out of our hands. I HIGHLY recommend eating at this restaurant.,It's so great that we were able to get all nine of you seated quickly, Connie. Absolutely fantastic flavors are what we're all about. Our staff really does have a gift for picking out the perfect meal for first-timers -- glad that was your experience.

"A tour guide recommended this place for great Chinese food.  He said the staff were rude but the food was great.
We found he was correct, the staff were all rude and the food was not great.  Its noisy and certainly not our type of place.,Scott, a great meal of Chinese food is all about bold, delicious flavors. To that end, we train all our staff to quickly deliver tasty food, so I wish your meal reflected these high standards.

"Our doorman recommended this restaurant and we were not disappointed - in fact we went there twice for dinner. This is a no nonsense place that turns over diners fairly quickly, but you can linger if you want. I recommend the Nanking Chicken which is delicious.

"There are so many great food places we wanted to try in SF, that we just stopped in for appetizers here.  I grew up with a Cantonese restaurant next door so I guess I'm a bit spoiled, but I really didn't like this that much.  We had the Pork Pot Stickers and Pork Egg Rolls and rice.

"The place was very busy when we arrived around 7pm on a mid-week evening, even though other restaurants on the same block were very quiet,  and we had to wait a short while to be seated.  The servers were a little bit brusque but that might have been because they were so busy.  I asked if they had gluten free items on the menu  and was told ""All"" which was a bit surprising and turned out not to be true.  When I came to order I asked if the Salt and Pepper Shrimp with Mushrooms was gluten free and the server said yes. so I went for that  My companions had Chow Mein and Sesame Chicken.   The food arrived amazingly quickly and the server said that the Sesame Chicken was also gluten free but that the Chow Mein was not.  The shrimp with mushrooms was wonderful (I had it again the next night it was so good).  I didn't try the chicken as, being Celiac, I'm usually pretty careful when eating out.  No ill effects the next day (or the day after my second visit) so I would recommend this restaurant to other gluten-intolerant diners.  The prices were also very reasonable.  All in all an excellent experience.,I appreciate your understanding that our servers need to work at a quick pace to get you that delicious. It's great to hear you enjoyed the shrimp so much! Stop back soon for another excellent meal.

"Me and my wife ate lunch at this restaurant while visiting San Francisco.  The menu is fairly limited and the restaurant is a no frills kind of place. However the food was very good.  We had the spicy wor dumpling soup, an order of pork egg rolls and salt & pepper shrimp. All were delicious and if you're in Chinatown you should definitely try it.,Very good food is what we're all about. It's great knowing you enjoyed the dumpling soup, the egg rolls, and the shrimp!

"We had lunch here with friends. The hot and sour soup is the best I have ever had. It comes out screaming hot in a very large bowl. I could have made a meal of it by itself. The soup is full of vegetables. You can order it with chicken, but I stuck with the traditional tofu. I also had the house noodles with pork. I think my noodles order got lost in the shuffle, since everyone else's food arrived but mine. We had to flag down our waitress, but once the noodles arrived I was not disappointed. The sesame chicken was sweet and crispy. Even something as basic as steamed rice was excellent-good chew and flavorful.,I'm delighted you and your friends could stop by! That hot and sour soup is such a great addition to the day. See you back for your next delicious flavor craving.

"Chinese opinion: salted duck (cold) was excellent, bean sprouts (mature) before average and possibly past serviceable. Menu items are different on the Chinese menu. Rice was good. Service wasn't good.

American: sour fish (flounder) was good mixed with the sprouts. Plastic dishware, cups and chopsticks are not healthy.

The atmosphere and food as prepared were very authentic. This could be one of the best with some easy corrections.,It's great knowing you enjoyed the duck and sour fish. All of our food, from the salted duck to the bean sprouts, is fresh and great quality. About the service and utiesenals, we have to get food out very quickly to feed our high volume of customers, so we try making every process as efficient as possible.

"Great food, very busy though.  You may have to wait in line.  Our server was rude but it made for a funny experience.  She gave us one menu for 6 people and then when she came back a few minutes later and we were not ready to order she yelled ""You no ready!"" and turned and walked away.  It is a good idea to research there menu ahead of time lol.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here.  A lot of the plates can even be shared because the helpings are large.  Worth stopping here if you like Chinese!

"A friend and I tried House of Nan King. There was some type of festival going on in China Town this past Saturday.  Lots of people in yellow shirts?  Anyhow, I have wanted to try this place, but the lines are always long.  

If you are looking for a quiet, quaint meal this is not the place for you. The seating is family style and you can certainly be rubbing elbows with someone you don't know, which can be interesting too.  We got moved from where we were originally seated to make room for a foursome. The service is matter of fact and not very pleasant, but the food was fairly quick and very good. 

We had Fried Calamari, which was tender. I felt some additional sauce would have been nice. It was battered, fried and seasoned with salt/pepper and lemon, so pretty straight-forward.  it was good. I'm not complaining, just seemed like it could have been more.  We also ordered Sesame Chicken, which was served with sweet potato and some cucumber on the side.  Very good and unique. The sweet potato offered a very nice offset to the vinegar like sweetness of the sesame chicken.  The dishes were not served at the same time?  Not sure why, but the sesame chicken came about 10 mins after the calamari.  I guess that happens here. The place was busy and a line formed after we stepped in.  I certainly miss Chef Jhia's which was down the block, but closed in 2013. What a pity.  The Honey Chili Chicken was amazing there!!,The best meals are ones with tasty food and great company. That's why I'm happy you and your friend enjoyed the meal. In regards to the order of your sesame chicken and calamari, we do bring the dishes out when they're ready. Our top priority is getting you delicious food, so we want it to be as fresh and hot as possible when it makes it to the table.

"Sesame chicken was delicious however not a fan of the onion cake. It was very greasy. The fried rice was average. The waiter was competent but was the most unfriendly we have ever had. He needs to rethink his vocation. My partner ate here 25 years ago and loved it. Wish we would have had the same experience.,Kristin, delicious sesame chicken is what we're all about, if only you'd loved the onioncakes just as much. They're normally cooked perfectly, so it's surprising and atypical that they were greasy. I'll be looking into figure why two of your dishes weren't to our normal standard.

"House of Nanking was recommended by a friend who ate here a few years back.  It may have been special back then but now is a fairly average tourist destination in an area  where you can make much better choices.  Crowded, very loud, not exactly the cleanest or friendliest place to dine.  I have to say that the food is good, not exceptional, but decent.  The thing that struck me the most was that there was not one table of Asian customers in the place,  kind of unusual in the heart of SF Chinatown.  You can do better, just ask some locals for suggestions.,I wish you'd really loved your meal. We have a loyal following, so it can get a bit crowded, but we do our best to make sure we're getting our customers seated and getting them delicious food as quickly as we can. As a result, service can seem a bit rushed, but that's never our employees' intention. About our customer base, we have a very diverse following, including people from various countries and backgrounds, both locals and tourists. We welcome and value every customer.

"This was the start of a girl's weekend to wine country! First night we went to another famous China town restaurant with just 3 of us...very disappointing - so the next night we were not really going to consider Chinatown again - but our big bus guide swore it was worth it - and HE WAS RIGHT! 
There were seven of us and we were told by the taxi driver let the owner or his wife just bring you food. Although skeptical - best choice ever!   food kept coming - everything was more delicious than the previous dish...we could not finish all that they brought us! With drinks and a good tip - we were at only about $35 pp. 
Can't wait to go back with my family!
Thank you House of Nanking for a great kick off of our wine adventure!,Maria, what a great way to start a girls' weekend to wine country! It's fantastic knowing the food lived up to your expectations and that we were able to repeadtly top  them throughout the meal.

"Visiting from out of town, this was one of the Chinese food restaurants I wanted to hit while in San Francisco. We lucked out and came just before the dinner rush.

It's a cozy (tight-squeeze) hole in the wall restaurant with awesome Chinese food. We were ushered in to a shared table and sat next to a couple ladies who were also from out of town. 

Our eyes were definitely hungrier than our stomachs as I proceeded to order 8 dishes for the three of us. This was too much but we got to try a bit of everything.

The service is no-muss, no-fuss; they take your order, bring you beers and food, give you your bill, you pay then leave. If you're expecting 5-star service don't come here. If you're expecting some unpretentious, tasty Chinese, then this is your place.

Of the eight things we ordered, my favourite was the 'Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken"" and ""Fried Tofu In Blackbean Sauce"". Their fried rice was also really good!

Overall, top marks for food, good straightforward service and ambiance is like a dive-y Chinese restaurant.,Annie, I'm glad you could try a bit of everything -- a variety is always nice. The sesame chicken is a delicious choice. It's famous for a reason. I'm thrilled you enjoyed the food so much.

"So, there are Zagat signs for multiple years on the door of this hole-in-the-wall San Francisco Chinatown restaurant.  If I hadn't read some of the reviews prior to going, I don't know if I would have stayed.  But, I understood that it would be quirky and odd before entering so I kind of expected anything.  It was packed and as my husband and I went into the restaurant, a couple of the people working there screamed - Table for Two?  Table for Two?  ""No, thank you.  We would like take out.""  Take out?  ""Yes, take out"".  What do you want?  ""May I see a menu?""  No, menu.  All menus are being used.  ""OK, can you make pork fried rice and Sesame chicken.  May I have plates and fork.""  No, plates.  No plates.  Since we were returning to our hotel, I knew I could get a couple of plates.  My husband decided to wait outside because there really isn't a place for Take Out customers to wait - I mean nowhere.  But, I kind of squeezed myself into a little spot.  The woman said ""  Outside - you go outside. Out - out!""  I did as I was told .....  afraid not to.  But, as odd as this experience was, it was an authentic experience, if that makes sense.

"Went to House of Nanking with my husband while in San Francisco! There was a long line out front when we arrived, but it came so highly recommended that we decided to wait it out. The line went surprisingly fast. Because there were only two of us, we were seated with another couple. This doesn't bother us at all; we enjoy visiting with new people!

We ordered the onion cakes, wonton soup, dumplings, and fried chicken. Everything was fantastic -- especially the onion cakes and wonton soup!! I've never had anything like the onion cakes and it was by far the best wonton soup we've ever tasted! Service was great, food was AMAZING, and we enjoyed the atmosphere!

"We only had time for a quick bite before racing for the 6:45 pm ferry, and House of Nanking filled the bill. They are fast! We got the famous sesame chicken (very tasty and a lot of it, comes with crispy root vegetable chips) and the equally vaunted fried calamari (so tender, but nothing to dip it in), beer and one glass of their house merlot. Should have ordered a vegetable side to counterbalance so much battered food, but didn't. The place is a classic local dive restaurant with brusque waitresses, no frills seating, and irresistible food, and we loved it!

"Suggested to us by a barman at Hilton Financial the restaurant is five minutes walk from there. Six of us came in for dinner, the maître d brought us beers and told us she would bring us a selection. What a feast- Scallops, prawns, chicken, beef, pork dumplings, a vegetable dish and a rice dish. All washed down with Tsing Tao beers.
Service was slick, the food heavenly and the bill surprisingly light.
Absolutely unmissable if you enjoy Chinese food.,You can't go wrong with a delicious feast shared between your group. It seems you tried a fantastic spread of dishes, which I'm thrilled you enjoyed. Those Tsing Tao beers make the perfect complement to the food -- good decision.

"We came around 4 for an early dinner, still on central time zone. The restaurant was pretty empty, of course. Not the most welcoming ambience and the menu was not extensive. A couple came in, sat down and then left. We were hungry so decided to stick it out, thankfully because the food was SO GOOD. I'm not a big Sesame Chicken fan but when someone in our party ordered them and I tasted them I was converted. I ordered the Shrimp Lettuce Wraps and they were really good, tasted even better the next day. One of our party also got the rice soup and she was making happy slurping noises throughout the whole meal. Very large portions so you can share or have leftovers. We ate at a different Chinese restaurant last night, with a slightly higher TripAdvisor rating, and while fine, wished we had come back here.,A sesame chicken convert -- that's such a huge compliment! I'm excited we could get you on board. We're all about creating the most delicious Chinese food, so it's great to know you're such a fan.

"Good chinese food in USA. I am impressed with the food but still a bit heavy for my palette. Portion is huge, for chinese , 1 plate is good enough for 2 to share. For me, I squeeze all the chicken into my tummy before I left. It's kind of stretching a bit.,It's awesome you thought the food was 5 stars great! I'm glad you enjoyed the chicken so much. Stop back soon.

"This place doesn't have the frills if that is what you are looking for. However, the food is excellent and you get large portions so share. We got the pork egg rolls, wonton soup, sesame chicken, and fried rice.,Our main priority is excellent food, so I'm thrilled that was your experience! You can't beat large portions of great food, especially when there's sesame chicken involved. Hope to see you again soon.

"The food is outstanding here, the Nanking sesame chicken is amazing, the fried pork eggrolls are amazing and the fried rice is amazing.

"The food here is incredible.  A culinary experience.  We had sesame chicken, potstickers, salt and pepper shrimp.  Once the chicken was delivered and tasted we immediately ordered another round of it.  It is not to be missed.  Place is packed and there was a line.  We didn't wait long.  Service is abrupt but fast.  They are getting everyone in and fed as quickly as possible.  Very casual.,An incredible culinary experience -- now, that's how we love hearing our food described, Heidi! It's exciting you loved the Sesame Chicken so much you ordered a second round of it. Hope to see you back soon.

"Hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had. I tried many different dishes and was happy with every single one. They were so flavoursome and you were able to identify different tastes (which is often impossible with Chinese). 
The service was very quick. 

I would normally walk past this restaurant but the food was perfect. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes Chinese food!!,Thanks, Jessica! The best Chinese food you've ever had is such a flattering compliment, especially since you loved every dish. We're all about great food and quick service, so I'm glad you enjoyed.

We were very lucky and were sat with another couple, America and an ex pat. We had a great evening. The food was superb, the beers nice and cold and the conversation with the couple next too us was very enjoyable. They gave us lots of pointers and being as this was our first trip/night in San Fran, very welcoming.

"As mentioned, the building is very crowded. You frequently will sit immediately next to other people. This is Chinatown, your not in the suburbs. I think that is part of the experience. Our tablemates were friendly and talkative. The food is excellent, service is good, prices are surprisingly cheap for this city,
Blooming blossom tea was neat. it is mild herbal flavor. Comes with a big acorn looking nut in bottom of glass. It bursts and flower stalk grows in your hot water. Cool to watch, but takes too long to attempt to video (3-5min).,Jay, we're all about that excellent Chinese food.

"Definitely not a restaurant to choose if you are planning a cosy dinner à deux, but if you are looking for delicious Chinese food, this is the place to go. The Nanking sesame chicken is called ""famous"" on the menu, and deservedly so: it is yummy. The green lettuce wrap is also very nice. We had to wait in line outside, but it was certainly worth it.,Famous and yummy sesame chicken is what we're all about, Simon. I'm glad you thought all of the dishes were delicious.

"Quite possibly the best Chinese food I've eaten.

We were lucky as we visited this restaurant at 8.30pm (it closes at 9pm) when the queue was small; pretty much every time we walked past during our stay in SF there was a line outside. 

Inside it is busy and a small space so be prepared to share a table with others; there is a bit of 'get them in, get them out' feel to the place so don't expect the staff to pamper you. The food portions were huge - we made the mistake of ordering a starter and a main each. Would suggest ordering little and often - we spent around $50 including 2 alcoholic drinks but we probably only ate about two thirds of the food. I had the dumpling soup and onion pancake. Both very tasty.

Well worth a visit.,Thanks for your kind review, Daniela. It's always exciting to hear when people think we have the best Chinese food they've eaten. The Dumpling Soup and Onioncakes do​ make for a great meal.

"Our hotel recommended this Chinese restaurant as really good and authentic. It was neither. We were told there was always a line so we were not willing to try it for dinner. We did get there for lunch. The food was of poor quality and not worth the money. A couple sitting next to us were locals (communal tables) and they told us they come there for sentimental reasons. Not for the food, which use to be really good, but had really gone downhill in the past years. It was very mediocre. It is living off past reviews. Service was hit and miss.,Sherri, our top priority is getting delicious food to the table, so it's disappointing to read about your visit. In regards to authenticity, our recipes are based on feedback and requests from customers and are not strictly traditional. About the food, we make the dishes fresh so ​they'll be extra delicious.

"The food was served hot and delicious!  Family operated restaurant worth visiting.  Was small and crowded at lunchtime, but the price was moderate (much the same as other eateries) and the food was just as expected.  Try the blossom tea, served hot with a flower of some kind in the bottom of the glass that bloomed as the tea cooled.

I had the won ton soup and it was unlike any won ton soup I've ever eaten. It was chock full of stuff. The dumpling appetizer was also delicious. I'd go back again. The menu was a bit sparse but I liked what I had. My wife wanted steamed buns which they didn't have. She was a bit disappointed with that. She also wasn't a huge fan of the won ton soup. She found it too spicy. I felt like an adventurous world traveler eating here.,That sesame chicken can really make any day better.

"We really enjoyed the Honey Crispy Beef. It did not look like much but it was AMAZING. One of the best dishes we have ever had.  We also had the  Sesame Chicken which was really ggod and the house fried rice. It seemed as if only one person really understood us. One of the waitresses yelled across the room at some patrons to tell them where they would be seated.  Our bill had the wrong items on it but seemed correct.  Overall, the food was very tasty but the service stunk. We would eat here again, just be forewarned about the service.,The beef is always a delicious choice!

Don't go here if you want a quiet , intimate dinner , it's very busy and noisy and generally there are three couples sat at a table of six.  The food is sensational . We had pork dumplings, peanut pop sticks for entree and the signature dish sesame chicken and ginger beef for mains.

"I can not fault the food from here it is delicious how ever their customer service is beyond shocking.
I have had two extremely bad experiences from here and won't be going here again no matter how nice the food is. 

My first experience was ordering a take out, 
The price of the food I was ordering was clearing marked on the menu but when I was presented with the cheque it was more I queried this and received an abrupt answer, 
the server said that when he put it into the till it was more. I said the menu states the price so surely that is not right that you are trying to charge me more, 
I was then shouted at by the server, he literally shouted at me and I was made to feel so embarrassed I left even though I was not in the wrong. 

Reluctant to visit again I thought I would give it another try with my friends, surely this time it would be better I thought as we were dining in. 
I couldn't of been more wrong, 
After paying a $12 tip which I thought was enough, the waitress came over to our table and argued, yes argued that we had not given enough, 
we felt pressurised into leaving more even though her attitude was disgusting.
Other customers heard how she spoke to us and left with out ordering any food. 

Absolutely shocking service. 

If you want a friendly server who smiles and says please and thank you you will not be getting it here. 

I have never experienced service this bad.,I’m disappointed to hear about these two experiences. While our servers do need to work at a quick pace, it’s never their intention to seem unwelcoming or pushy. Without specifics, I can’t speak in too much detail about your bill concerns, but I can assure you that we take care to charge the correct amount. That being said, I do apologize if anything made you feel embarrassed or pressured. I do hope you’ll consider giving us one more chance to make a good impression.

"The House of Nanking gets a very good Trip Adviser rating but the reality is a little bit more ordinary. The restaurant itself is quite small and a little shabby. The tables are squeezed together making it a cosy atmosphere.
The menu has plenty of choice and the dishes we chose were served in good time, hot and were tasty. Service was hardly attentive and it took a while to catch the waiter's attention to get the bill.
Overall it compared favourably to other Chinese restaurants in terms of ambience and value for money but I wouldn't be rushing back.,While I’m glad you enjoyed the meal, I wish you’d found the whole experience a bit more extraordinary.

Is a small rather nondescript place towards the end of Chinatown. The atmosphere is simple, small, nothing fancy. However the food was outstanding. Service was attentive without being overbearing. Prices were very good. I would highly recommend having lunch or dinner at the House of Nanking.  Big thumbs up!,Outstanding food -- that’s what we’re all about.

"We visited here based on Trip Advisor research. Subsequently it was recommended to us by a resident. It is quite small and there was a short queue and it is a relatively quick experience. The menu is not the classic Chinese menu you see in the UK but a good choice. Alas our noodles never arrived and these were meant to be a great choice. We loved the sesame chicken and the lemon/chicken soup most. We ordered one dish which was beef and veg to wrap in pancakes (it sounded like peking duck) but this was the weakest dish.

Recommend as a destination in China Town.,A delicious order of sesame chicken can really brighten any day -- glad you enjoyed that and the chicken soup. I'm sorry the noodle dish never arrived, though. That's pretty uncharacteristic of us. Regardless, we're glad you enjoyed your visit and hope you'll visit us again the next time you're in town.

"Came here for a lunch while some friends were visiting from out of town. 
I was soooooo happily surprised on how delicious the food was at this restaurant. 
This place is a perfect mix of authentic chinese and using local ingredients to make chinese food taste fresh and delicious.
We ordered the:
House Noodles
Sugar Snap Pea Salad
Flower Blossom Tea (served in a plastic beer mug)
Sesame Chicken 
Eggplant (Appetizer)
Veggie Chow Mein
Green Beans

The Sesame chicken was great for kids and then people that just want some type of gooey sweet chicken similiar to what they  can get any Americanized Chinese place.

My favorites were the Sugar Snap Pea Salad, Green Beans and House Noodles. The house noodles were definitely fresh handmade noodles with a light sauce and pea sprouts.  The green beans were similiar to traditional green bean chinese dish but with Thai Basil.  

Great prices. We had 6 adults and 4 kids for lunch with a bill about $100. Pretty good for SF.,It sounds like you were able to try a nice variety of our dishes! It's always fun to explore the menu, and it makes it especially exciting for me to see you loved all of food so much! While our sesame chicken is definitely a crowd favorite, I enjoy hearing when customers love the other dishes just as much.

"Our pedicab driver recommended and he was right.  It's rather a hole-in-the-wall kind of place but don't let that throw you off.  It was clean and the food was totally excellent.  I had sesame chicken that had exactly the right amount of sweetness but wasn't sticky.  The pork eggrolls were quite different than the usual fare; packed with meat and no rice.  Very very tasty.  I ordered the detoxing tea and it was odd in that the flowers were floating and I had no way to drink unless I strained them out with my fork.  But the tea was wonderful.  Do not expect western table service but they were very responsive once you catch their eye.,Totally excellent food is what we're all about, Cathy.

Menu limited in terms of main courses however the sesame chicken is a must, more about that later. We ordered two staters, pork egg rolls and chicken dumplings however everything came with main course, but no matter, our meal was complete with a sqid main dish. All dishes were fantastic, sesame chicken is speciality and deserves pride of place. Don't expect any frills with service, Coke is served in can with straw, but lovely and cold.

"Truely, looks like a dive, but has the absolute best Chinese food in the USA.  

I have had various things.  The sesame chicken is probably my favorite.  Tasty, crispy with sweet potatoes on the side (difficult to explain).

The succulant melts in your mouth calemari was also amazing.

Food comes out pretty quickly.  The seating often has multiple partys fit in at the same tables, but it's not uncomfortable.  Don't be surpised to have long lines waiting outside if you come during key meal times, so I'd recommend trying to come either a bit late or a bit early for the lunch/dinner times.

Not overly expensive food, but not super cheap.  The average meals run from $13 - $16 I'd say for the main meal.  Add another $8-10 for an appatizer and another $6-7 for a soup if you add those in.  

The owner of the restaurant at times will come by and order for you if you come together with a small group.  I have yet to have anything less than well above average tasting, so I think you probably can't go wrong there.,The absolute best Chinese food in the country -- that’s a truly amazing compliment, Adam! You really can’t go wrong with a great meal of our sesame chicken, so it’s good to hear you wholeheartedly agree. I’m glad you’ve been able to so thoroughly enjoy all of the dishes you’ve tried.

"I had been here 25 years ago when it was just a counter. I was excited to hear of its success. They are famous for the sesame chicken and it was good, especially the sweet potato, I thought. Other dishes like the beef boa didn't hold up. But we loved the wanton soup. Had we felt like we had more time to review the menu we may have made better choices. Next time!,You can never go wrong with a tasty meal of sesame chicken, Michael, which is why we make sure ours is delicious. On that note, I wish you'd enjoyed all of your dishes as much as you liked the chicken and wanton soup. We make everything fresh, so all the dishes should be amazing. I'm delighted you're willing to give us another chance to wow you because I know we can really impress next time.

Until then,

"Good chinese cuisine, well cooked and very different from other chinese restaurants. The Nanking chicken and the beef chowder were  delicious. Only negative point was the service: food arrived in a hurry but they forgot to serve the rice with the entrèe and brought it when the sauce was already cool. The bill was presented when we were still eating and my chair was taken away while I was in the restroom.,It’s great hearing you enjoyed your chicken and beef chowder. Getting that delicious food quickly to your table is our top priority, so our service is designed to make sure we can efficiently serve the many people that come in. That being said, it’s disappointing to hear you felt rushed through your meal because we want everyone to feel welcomed and relaxed when they’re here. I hope you’ll give us another chance to make an all around great impression.

"Got to the House of Nanking around 4:30 on Thursday evening, place already packed. Our party was 6 hungry people, we only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, then the fun started.... Our waitress knew that we had never been there before, so she said, ""Trust Me"", so the dishes started coming... We had beef, chicken, shrimp, seafood, rice, dumplings, ect... Had the flowering hot tea, could not believe that!!!! When we finally said enough, the bill with tip was only $30.00 each!!!! Highly recommend the House of Nanking if you are looking for real Chinese!!!,Beef, chicken, shrimp, seafood, and dumplings -- talk about a delicious meal, Becky! I’m always amazed by how good our staff is at picking out the perfect dishes for a table. They really have a talent for it. 

We appreciate your recommendation!

"The food is the best we have ever had.  They don't waste time on decor or chatting up customers.  This is not a place to linger.  We have been back many times.  Go early before the rush.  Again, the food is the best!,I love hearing from our repeat customers! Knowing it's the best food you've ever had is really one of the best compliments we could ask for. Thanks!

See you again soon,

"Having lunch there we saw a thief taking away a client's camera. That was not nice... makes you feel unsafe. Once we finished, we wanted to pay 50$ for an 46$ account (I know that was not the 15% tip, but I had a bad experience and I thought it was not fare, not just because of the thief, also for a really bad service, the worst I've ever had in USA) and a waitress asked us the amount to complete the 15% tip. It's amazing how people can be so rude and so nasty.,We want our customers to feel safe at all times when visiting us, so it’s disappointing to hear about your experience. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention, though. While I don’t know the specifics about your service, I’m sorry if it was anything less than quick and respectful. We do need to work at a very fast pace, but it’s never our servers’ intention to come across a rude.

I hope you’ll consider giving us another chance the next time you’re in the area.

"Got there before a super rush. I like the tight seating. Flowering hot tea was a great surprise. Good potstickers. Must order onion cakes and house noodles. Wish I had gotten the sesame chicken . Bing bao beef (?) not so much. Definitely worth the visit.,Great potstickers, delicious onion cakes, and tasty house noodles -- that’s how we do it. Glad you enjoyed those dishes and the environment! Hopefully we can make your next meal here even better!

"If you like Chinese  food you must go there! Really fast service despite a lot of people in line. Staff professional. Good value for money.
Try chichen, noodles, mushrooms and shrimps ...really delicious!,All great days involve chicken, noodles, and shrimp, Valerio. That’s why we make sure ours are really delicious. It’s great to know you had such an outstanding experience with the food and staff. Hopefully you’ll be able to stop by again!

"Everything everybody is saying about House of Nanking is true... Yes, there is a line in front. Yes, the line moves quickly. Yes the waiters are not friendly. Yes the place is cramped. Yes the food is good. 

We were a party of three an just before us in the line was another party of three. So after spending 15 mins in line, we got seated together at a table for six. Kinda awkward in the beginning, but the folks next to us were quite nice, so it was no problem. We ordered two different starters: the fried dumplings in peanut sauce and the shrimp wrappers (can't remember the exact name anymore). The dumplings and especially the peanut sauce were quite nice, but the shrimp wrappers were 1 shrimp in a very big crust. Did not like that too much. The entrées were very good, we had their signature dish, the sesame chicken and also fried shrimp with mushrooms and some beef with vegetables. All were very tasty. The waiters however kept whacking plates on our table even if there was no space. They'll just shove it under where your hand is so you have to rest your hand on your lap. Not so nice. You can call it Chinese culture as some people on TripAdvisor do, but I find it rude and not customer centric. Finally, my wife visited the restroom when we left and found that the paper napkin packages were stored there, in the very restroom itself. That's not Chinese culture for sure, that's just gross. 
Overall, good food but the rest can surely be improved. A lot. Would not return, but instead would try to find another nice Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.,Harald, all parts of your meal of sesame chicken should leave you full, happy, and wanting to come back for more. On that note, everyone on our staff is trained to get delicious food to the table quickly because we have a high volume of customers. Our servers need to work at a fast pace to make sure everyone is seated and has their food, but it’s never their intention to come across brusquely. While I’m glad you enjoyed your sesame chicken, I wish all of your visit had impressed you just as much. I hope you’ll reconsider and give us a try again sometime.

"Had no idea of what was what, fresh off a long haul flight and we found ourselves here. It is very fast paced environment and it is a little like being hearded cattle. The food was great though and value for money, recommend this place for anyone who enjoys great Asian food,Great Chinese food is what we’re all about, and I’m glad it hit the spot right after your long flight! It is a fast paced environment, but it’s all so we can get you the delicious food you’re craving as quickly as possible.

We love hearing great feedback about our service and are glad you had an overall great visit!

"You are very likely going to have to queue to get in, unless you book ahead. 

No here's the thing. If you are averse to sitting close to other people, and brisk no nonsense service then this may not be for you.

If you are more relaxed. Perhaps ok with starting a conversation with the folks next to you, don't mind a matter of fact service (it's quick), and want good Chinese food then we would strongly recommend this place.

We had the garlic fish which was great, as was the sesame chicken.,A great meal of Chinese food always makes for a great break in the day. That’s why we’re all about delicious sesame chicken and garlic fish. I’m glad you enjoyed your visit, and hopefully we can make your next one even better.

"We only had a short wait for a table and we were a party of 6. The restaurant is rather cafe style, and the waiters and waitresses a little brusque, but the food was very good. Definitely recommended for tasty Chinese food.,Great food is our top priority, so it’s good hearing you really enjoyed your meal, Kate.

"I've never been anywhere quite like here! The first rule is - book a table or you will queue. The second is - decide quickly. The waiters are on you in a flash to find out what you want. Thirdly - don't over order. Fourthly - don't be surprised if you have had starters and a main course and find yourselves out in 40 minutes! The food can come in a random order as well. But it's definitely one of the best Chinese we have ever eaten! And an experience we shall talk about for years!,Definitely some of the best Chinese food you’ve eaten -- thanks for the great compliment! It’s great hearing you enjoyed your meal and had a memorable experience. Hopefully we can make your next visit here even better.

"The absolute best Chinese food ever. The fried calamari is a must. Lightly fried with amazing tender texture. Also the orange chicken with the lightly fried rice is so good. Don't be misled by atmosphere or the staff. Although the place isn't the most nicely remodeled place and seems a little outdated the food is amazing. Also the staff has their own type of manners which to some might seem rude but I found it to be rather fun and interesting. I've never had food served faster either. Literally our first order came 5min after we placed it. Super good food.,All the best days involve a delicious meal of Chinese food. That’s why we make sure our dishes leave you feeling happy and full. It sounds like you were able to try a nice variety of food, from the calamari to the orange chicken, so it’s great knowing they all left such a great impression!

"My husband, school-age stepson and I dined across the street from House of Nanking last weekend. We saw a long line to get into the restaurant and wondered what all the fuss was about. The next night we happened to be walking down the street searching for a dinner spot and realized House of Nanking was where the line was. It was early - around 5 PM - and no line. So we decided to tuck in for dinner.

We were immediately seated at one of the crowded, rickety tables inside. Plates, napkins, and flatware were already stacked on our table. Our waiter came over to take our order immediately. 

There weren't too many appealing vegetarian items on the menu for me, but options for meat and fish eaters are abundant. My stepson ordered the steamed pork dumplings and sizzling rice soup, husband got the crispy rice noodle tower with shrimp, I had the green lettuce wrap with vegetables.

Our food arrived quickly. The others devoured their meals. My own meal was ok - I liked the mix of peas, onions, and pineapple. 

Service was fast - I'm not sure we were there for even an hour - they turn tables over quickly there. In the time we were there a line formed outside. 

There's only one unisex restroom and frankly it was disgusting. 

I personally wouldn't return but judging by the line outside I'm in the minority.,Thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately our vegetarian menu isn’t as expansive as our other types of dishes, but I’m glad you were able to find something that sounded good and that your family liked their meals enough to devour them. About the service, our main concerns are getting you seated and getting you delicious food, so we set our tables and take orders to handle our high volume as smoothly as possible. In regards to the restroom, I can assure you we follow all health and safety codes and take cleanliness very seriously. This is the first I’m hearing of this, and I will address it. I hope you’ll reconsider and give us another try in the future.

"Went here for lunch.  Server was a bit rough, almost like the soup guy in the Seinfeld episode but female.  Food was excellent.  Sesame chicken is very good.

I’m happy to hear you enjoyed the food so much because getting everyone a great tasting meal is our top priority.

"Tiny tables squashed together. Food is practically thrown at you, starters and main courses arrive at same time. Never a smile or thank you from the staff who all look like they wish they weren't there. Food is terribly bland and all tasted very similar and we had 5 starters and 5 main courses.,A great meal of Chinese food can really make your day, which makes it all the more disappointing to learn you didn’t enjoy your experience. Getting you great food is our number one priority, so our servers need to work at a quick, efficient pace and bring out the food once it’s cooked. I’m surprised to hear about the flavors, so I do plan to look into it. I hope you’ll consider giving us another try in the future.

"This used to be our favorite restaurant. We noticed that the menu had gotten smaller. WE ordered a few items, fried rice, bak chop and shrimp. The portion of fried rice was small and greasy and not a lot of flavor. So sorry this has happened to our favorite restaurant. I guess it go too popular.,I appreciate hearing this feedback from a longtime customer -- we want every visit to be just as good as your first time here.

"We had the famous sesame chicken, calamari, fried rice and pork egg rolls. All were delicious and fresh! We had lunch around 2pm and didn't have to wait so I recommend going on off peak times as the restaurant was full then. The service was fast and food came out super fast. Portions were huge!

"Facts: 1) this is the first survey I have ever taken the time to write  2) there was a line out front waiting to get in before we arrived and after we left  3) the dinning area is no bigger than 20 x 30.  4) it received an 86 in its latest inspection  5) they serve in plastic bowls and cups  6) the staff looked like they just rolled out of bed in the morning  6) there is duck tape holding tiles together in certain sections of the wall 7) the bathroom is immediately adjacent to the kitchen  7) the food was average at best  8) our meals came in sequential order...each of the 3 ate separately...very strange  9) numerous guests were forced to have with strangers as they push tables together to maximize the room.   10) we were forced to pay cash...the owner claimed that the ""machine"" was double charging guests...I requested that they simply divide the bill in two and run my charge...she wouldn't do it!!!  11) they were offended when I didn't leave a 20% tip!!!

Opinion: I would never recommend this place to anyone... it is a tourist trap...,Mark, I’m sorry you didn’t love your experience. We get a high volume of customers, so our service is designed to make sure we can get everyone delicious food as quickly as possible, which is why we use communal tables and bring the food out when it’s ready.

Before we sat down we were informed by a group who had eaten there before to let the staff choose our meal. On sitting down our waitress asked if we would like her to order for us.

"Arguably the best Chinese food in San Francisco! People say the servers are rude, but it is simply their nature and they are in no way being rude or ignoring you. It can get busy sometime and they have to keep up with everyone's orders. Besides that, they have a short but simple menu, and everything on that menu is absolutely delicious. You can tell they have authentic Chinese food and everything is fresh. If you're in the Chinatown area, stop by House of Nanking and grab a bite to eat!,Fresh and arguably the best Chinese food in the city -- thank you for the great compliments!

Know what your getting into and enjoy yourself.  We were a party of two on a Saturday night and were expecting a wait.  It was about 30 minutes outside in the que.  we were finally seated at the table for 6 with 2 other couple, no problem.  Fried potstickers good appetizer, sesame chicken per reviews a must, husband had a spicy calamari dish, very good.  The garlicky green beans were excellent. Great meal, crazy loud, crowded atmosphere.,There’s nothing better than a delicious meal of sesame chicken, spicy calamari, and potstickers.

"Big hype on this place, queues , tv programmes and all that. We arrived late lunch on a vert busy Saturday in SF and only queued for 10 mins, a simple layout in this resturant and a short menu to match. All good things, service pleasing and fast, food good, a few different things on the menu, all westen chinese and nothing too edgy. Fried onion cake stole the show, crispy, lots of green onion and a sweet peanut sauce which we've never had before and it was great...I'm sure there are better resturants tucked away in SF but you are in safe hands here plus it's got the publicity, worth a visit.,Good choice with the Fried Onioncakes!

"I haven't been here since 2010, so this review is way overdue. To be honest, I don't remember what we ordered because we pretty much let the wait staff pick all the dishes, anything that was super good and enough for 10 people. We had numerous dishes, all of which were super delicious and left me in a food coma. So when you come here, just tell them to order you the best menu items and trust that your tummy will thank you later. Service was...well, you know how service at Chinese establishments are, so keep your expectations low in that department.  Not sure how much the menu has changed in 6 years, but I loved this place. I walked by here recently, and there was a line out the door, so my assumption is that it's still living up to the recommendations. If I wasn't already full from my brunch, I would have hit this place up for old time's sake.,I’m glad your visit here was so delicious and memorable that you decided to write such a nice review!

"I'll be honest, the food was very good. When we walked in, we were put right next to someone else, as if we were at a table with friends. We didn't really have much privacy. They had one menu for 3 people. They asked for more and were given just one more. They were kind enough to give us one of theirs and us 4 shared one menu. We then asked for another one and got just one more literally slapped on the table. Not sure if it's a southern thing but I asked for sweet tea and I got hot tea which tasted nothing like iced sweet tea. They did the right thing though and replaced it and only charged for the sweet tea. Other than that, cheap and good food.,Our top priorities are getting people seated and getting everyone the great food they’ve come to expect, so I’m happy you really enjoyed your dishes. To make sure you get your awesome meal quickly, we will use communal seating, which can also be a fun way to engage with the community.

"After looking on Trip advisor for a good Chinese restaurant in San Francisco on a visit from the uk we decided on this one after reading glowing reports. 
It was a Saturday night and very busy. 
We had to share a table with 5 other people. Our order was taken. And it wasn't long before the calamari dish arrived which was lovely, however no fried rice which had been ordered. Our second dish then arrived which again was lovely but again no rice dish. After eating both these dishes I then asked about rice dish after another 5 mins it arrived with no apology. I sent it back. And asked for the check.  This arrived with no rice dish charged. 
As I've said the food I had was lovely but I had to eat with no rice dish and the only reason I was given was they where busy. 
Not good enough really. I could have gone to Panda Express and had all my meal together.,Phil, we're all about topping expectations with our delicious Chinese food, from the main dishes to the sides, so I apologize for the delay in getting your rice to you. Our top concern is getting delicious food to the table quickly, so I’m sorry if, as a result, we forgot to apologize for the confusion. That being said, I’m glad we were able to sort it out and get the rice removed from your bill. 

I will look further into what happened so we can make sure you're impressed with every part of your next experience, from the calamari to the rice.

"Accompanied my son and daughter-in-law to this place while suffering extreme jet-lag - but worth the experience!
First things first - the food was excellent, service friendly, but fast, and the place has an alcohol licence - and everything is cheap. Can quite see why this place makes it into all the guides, and in the evening there is always a line. But the turnover is fast, and our wait was't too long.
But don't expect elegance or a quiet meal - this place has an informal vibe, and is generally crammed with happy punters, most of them young!,You know it’s a great meal when you can enjoy it in spite of your extreme jet-lag! Excellent food and effective service are what we’re all about, so I’m glad you enjoyed it so much. We do have a more casual ambiance, but that’s just so everyone can feel welcomed to enjoy some delicious Chinese food. 

Hopefully we can make your next visit even better!

"I came here after seeing reviews that this was an amazing place to eat. We walked in, sat at a table and then were yelled at to move and sit somewhere else. I thought this was okay because I had seen reviews that the workers were rude. We were rushed into ordering and waitress answered with shrugs and ""I don't know"" to our questions about menu items. (The place was not packed at all by the way) Again, I thought, this place has great reviews no biggie they just aren't friendly. A different waitress brought out food and pulled my friends arm out of the way to place the plate on the table without even saying anything to warn that she was behind her. At this point my family and I still don't think anything of it and even joked about the lady potentially hitting my friend to move next time. In one instance, we were looking around for a restroom inside the restaurant and our waitress saw and yelled from across the place ""WHAT"". We said nothing and went back to eating our food. Nobody came to ask if we needed anything, more drink, a box, napkins, etc. we thought, that's fine. After being yelled at and rushed into ordering...we were done eating and asked for the tab. The meal was good not cheap, not expensive, just good. At the end when I signed my receipt and put ""0"" for tip (because I had left cash tip on the table) a lady who also worked there and wasn't our waitress, came by and asked where was the tip. At first I didn't understand her question, she became agitated and pointed at the receipt and said ""there's 0 for service...Where's the tip."" I was shocked she was asking me this. I showed her the cash on the table and she carried on. We all got up and left. I get it, it's good food but that doesn't give them a reason to treat people like that. I would never go back. I'm on vacation and yes, we want good food but not at the cost of bad service.,It’s disappointing to hear you didn’t enjoy your service as much as your food. I’m sorry if there was any miscommunication with our servers, but they do need to work at a fast pace to ensure that we can get delicious food to all of our customers. I assure you it’s never their intention to be rude. I hope you’ll be willing to give us a second chance if you come back to the area.

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"To be honest if it hadn't been recommended by a local who was Chinese we would have walked on by.  The menu is basic as is the decor.  The food is brilliant and amazing cheap. Go try it,Brilliant and amazing food -- thanks, Karen! I’m glad you listened to the local's recommendation and stopped in.

Hopefully you’ll get to dine with us again soon,

"This restaurant was recommended by an American cousin
There were 11 of us 
We arrived to find a long queue
After 30mins we were found space - very basic accommodation but who cares!!
When the lady waiter found out we had never been before she took back the menus and said ""leave it to me!""
She delivered course after course of absolutely delicious food
I have been eating Chinese food for over 50yrs in many countries and I have to say it was the best I have ever had

Incredible!!
 vun,Course after course of absolutely delicious food -- that’s what we absolutely love to hear, Tony! It sounds like you know your Chinese food, so we really appreciate the compliment that we’re the best you’ve ever had. 

Hope you’ll visit again,
Kathy, Manager"
"Food is good with large portions. Definitely order the sesame chicken.

Service is no frills. Very fast and efficient but not a place to linger over a meal.,Happy to hear we wowed you with our sesame chicken. Our main goal is to provide delicious food, so I’m glad we were able to do so effectively and efficiently. 

Hope we’ll see you again soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"Looking around for parking,  finally  we found  em across the street,  the waitress  help us with the order. We have some beef,  the chicken,  vegetable , the chef and owner him self greet us,  and recommend  the food,  interesting  they will ask u first do you already visit this restaurant before,  awesome !,Beef and chicken -- good choice, Danny! Glad you had an awesome experience, and I hope we’ll have the opportunity to see you again soon.

All the best,

"Great food, straight too the point. No nonsense get in get out and enjoy your day. Food was better than expected,  although the waitress seemed rushed she took the time to answer another tables many dietary needs.,Glad you enjoyed your food so much -- we love beating your taste expectations! Hope we were able to help you enjoy your day a little bit more.

"We decided to eat here because of the other great reviews. We weren't sure what we wanted so the waitress decided for us. I was a little nervous about this as I am somewhat a picky eater. There were 3 of us and we got a chicken, beef, and shrimp dish. They were all delicious! We also shared a fried rice. Also the service was pretty fast. We had to wait outside for about 10 minutes around 2 pm. The only thing was it was a little pricey and I was still a little hungry after we left. There were a lot of vegetables and not as much meat on the dishes.,Happy to hear you thought the chicken, beef, and shrimp dish was delicious, Cassie! I bet next time we can show you the perfect experience.

Hope to see you again soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were very pleased with stopping here for dinner.  We had seen that there was always a line outside at this place so we gave it a shot. The food was very good and the menu was limited. The food is brought to the table once it ready, so you may get your chicken before noodles but again everything was good and reasonable priced.,I’m glad you were able to stop by for dinner, Kathleen. Since great food is our number one priority, we want to make sure that everything is hot and fresh when it arrives at your table. Thanks for the nice review!

Looking forward to seeing you again,
Kathy, Manager"
"If you’re looking for something fancy, quiet, with no waiting line and friendly waiters then this place is not for you, don’t spend half an hour to an hour in line because you will be disappointed. But if you’re looking for a great food experience in China town then this is the place for you. 

The dinner is very casual, small, loud  and with sticky tables, but none of this matters because this place is all about great, delicious food. 

The food comes fast, portions are large and you don’t feel overwhelmed by the menu, just order, eat and go.

Here I had the best ever Sesame Chicken with sweet potatoes. Now, every time I would eat this dish in any other Chinese restaurant I will compare it to the one at the House of Nanking.

If you’re all about great food and don’t care too much about service or plastic water cups then this place will be worth the wait and would definitely give you a good experience.,Thanks for the great review here, Tar! Our team is all about great food and quick, efficient service, so this is great to read. Hope you make it back for another round of that Sesame Chicken sometime soon!

Kathy, Manager"
"I used to look forward to my visits to this restaurant when I first was in the Bay Area 10 years ago. I was shocked to discover that after all this time the place just got older, the owners don't seem to have put any effort in maintaining, let alone updating the restaurant. On top of that the service has gotten much worse, even at times when there aren't many customers, to the point that one needs to get to the counter or kitchen to get some attention. Also an indication that it has now become just a mediocre tourist hot spot (the kind listed on all those old, cheap guides) is that one has to ask for chopsticks or they will just give you fork and knife: what kind of truly Chinese restaurant does that?! 
And one can find food as good if not better than theirs in some of the many neighboring restaurants.,It’s disappointing your most recent experience wasn’t just as outstanding as your first one. We want to make sure our customers are getting amazing food as quickly as possible, so for efficiency, we do give forks, but we also provide chopsticks to those who would like them. As far as the service goes, are staff needs to work at a fast pace to ensure that everyone gets served in a timely manner. Since you’ve been a longtime customer, I hope you’ll come back and let us show you a magical experience like your first one 10 years ago.

Take care till then,
Kathy, Manager"
"This very popular Chinese restaurant is worth the wait.  Fresh, rich flavors paired with a fast paced atmosphere made it very enjoyable and fun. We would definite come back.,Glad we could impress you, Tom -- thanks for a great review.

"Ive been coming here every few years for over 20 years and it has never disappointed. The place has been renovated and the menu seems a little leaner than years ago but the owner is still greeting customers and pointing out best choices for the day. On this trip I ate there for both lunch and dinner. It is worth the wait because the service is speedy and the food is always fresh and well prepared. Favorites include dishes with sweet potatoes and interesting Chinese root vegetables ans leafy greens. Fish dishes are fresh. The soups may seem ordinary when reading the ingredients but they are uniquely flavored and delicious.,You've been coming to see us for over 20 years? That's no small compliment, and I don't take it lightly -- thanks for your support! I'm really honored the meal can always impress, and I'm glad you've had the chance to try out more than a few different things. Hope you'll have the chance to see us again soon! 

Until next time,
Kathy, Manager"
"We had heard about this place from a different TA contributor who was very complimentary of the food, so we thought we'd give it a try while exploring China Town.

Small, loud and busy, this place was all of those and more.   Seemingly disorganized and disconnected, this place delivered!

It was somewhat difficult to communicate our order  (but it just didn't matter).  It arrived hot and was absolutely delicious!!  I would go back here in a second.  The atmosphere is half of the experience...it's authentic and ultimately, very satisfying!,You'd come back in a second? That's just the impression we want to leave you with, Cory -- so glad it was all tasty for you! I really appreciate your compliments on the atmosphere and meal, and I sure hope you'll make it back for another bite someday! 

Until then,

"Read all the glowing reviews and admittedly came with high hopes. Despite a reservation we were made to wait in the street for 30 minutes.  Restaurant was busy (read full) so get that.

Once inside we (party of five) were shown to a somewhat sticky wet table, service is brusque at best, no emotion just order, eat and get going. 

We felt the food was on the low end of average. We ordered a broad range of dishes and dumplings. Portions were large, but quality was so so and dumplings particularly poor.

With a beer each our bill was $150 which we felt was steep for a disappointing dining experience. Won't be returning.,It's pretty disappointing this is the impression you left with, and I have to say I'm a bit surprised -- this isn't what we usually hear. We serve many people a day and our servers work at a very fast pace. Sometimes this tends to come off as rude, but that's never the intention. As far as the meal goes, I can assure you we use only the highest-quality ingredients to prepare our dishes, and I hope we'll get another chance to really let them shine for you someday. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Food was fairly good and service was quick but lacking in any manners or finesse. It was surprisingly  busy for a Monday early evening and overall the good food made up for service,Oliver, thanks for stopping by -- I'm glad you enjoyed your meal with us! (That's certainly my priority for you: Good food). Come back soon, and when you do, be hungry!

"Lot's of good choices for authentic cuisine in Chinatown and House of Nanking is a great option.  The chow mein, cold noodles, steamed dumplings, garlic scallops, and sesame chicken are just some of the items we sampled.  Everything was tasty and unique.  The service was prompt. Definitely worth a visit; or two.,Thanks for the love! It sounds like you know exactly what we're all about, and that makes me really, really happy. Come and see us again soon!

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"Having read a review had put this on the list of places to eat whilst there. This is not a fine dining experience but it's well worth a visit . We were greeted by the owner who was helpful and pleasant. It was well attended . Good choices are not overwhelming. We had prawn parcels for starters which were delicious followed by noddles and a beef dish and were not disappointed in the slightest . Would highly recommend as a restuarant to go to in China town. The fact that the owner is visibly present and very hands on taking your orders etc is great,It was my pleasure -- thank you for stopping in for some dishes with us! I'm so happy to see that you enjoyed all your dishes here with us, and I hope you'll come back to try some more! 

See you soon, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Fantastic pork potstickers but unfortunately that’s where it ended for me. It is a small restaurant located in a quieter part of Chinatown, tables very very close together and none of the waiters were friendly.  It’s alright for a in and out dinner the meals came out quickly and was defiantly an experience. My partner had Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken and I had noodles both dishes were just ok.,You should have gotten the best here, Kaylah, and it's a shame that you didn't enjoy yourself with us. We work at a fast pace -- we want you to get your food quickly -- but we never mean to come across as unfriendly. I hope you'll give us another shot and we can make a dish that's perfect for your tastes.

Kathy, Manager"
"Be prepared to queue, however the wait is worth it. Everything from the fried rice, sesame chicken, crispy fish and tea was fabulous. A tasty meal in a basic restaurant setting - you'll be sitting right next to other diners in a small restaurant that even has soda (soft drink) cans stacked right next to the kitchen. If you want good food and don't care about a fancy table setting, then you must come here.,Glad the food was able to wow you! We make everything to order, and I'm thrilled that each and every dish was perfect. Hope to see you back soon! 

All my best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Walking through Chinatown its not every restaurant that has people waiting outside but this one did so we knew that was a good sign. Walked in and squeezed into the only two seats available and was quickly greeted by our server. The food came fast--our hopes of a great find were confirmed with the first of several dishes we ordered. Come hungry, try lots of things--you won't be disappointed.

Super casual.,Thanks for giving us a shot, Bill -- I'm glad you stopped in! It sounds like you got to try a few favorites here, and I can't wait to see you back for more!

"My girlfriend and I wanted to try some Chinese food in China Town and saw this restaurant ranked highly on Trip Advisor.

We ordered the sesame chicken which wasn't bad but wasn't great.  We also had the steamed dumplings which were pretty good.  Finally we ordered the pork fried rice.  We ordered all 3 together and the rice never came out.  We finished the first two items and became full so we told them not to bother with the rice.  The waitress went to the back and threw a fit back there.  5 minutes later the rice came out anyway.  It was mushy and didn't taste good either.

We also ordered waters 3 times.  They never came.  The final time we asked for waters our waitress asked the table next to us if they wanted waters too as they had just sat down. They received their order of waters but we did not.  My girlfriend had a bottle of water in her bag so we just drank that one.

I wouldn't come here again.  The food was average at best.  The waitress seemed annoyed she had to do her job and really didn't bring out the items we ordered.  Try somewhere else if you're looking for a good place to eat in China Town.,That's not the experience we want you to have here, and I'm so disappointed that you left unhappy. We work quickly and efficiently here, but we never mean it to come off as rude. I'd love another shot to show you the incredible service and food you deserve. 

Keep in touch, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Fast and furious but a real Chinatown experience and great food. Limited menu which is a good sign. All food cooked fresh and super tasty! I'd definitely go back.,Thanks -- glad you're a fan! We work at a fast pace, and I hope you make it in again soon!

"Went here after reading the reviews on here- wasn't disappointed. Quire a small, basic restaurant in Chinatown, was very busy when we arrived. Seating is  very basic-long tables sitting next to other diners. Waiter came  very quickly and took our order, food followed  quickly and the bill arrived before we'd even finished! So as long you're not looking for a leisurely meal, this place is great. We were in and out in 45 minutes!!,Your time is valuable -- we're not here to waste it! Glad you enjoyed all your dishes with us, and we'd love to see you back soon.

"The food here is absolutely delicious!!!!  We were seated and greeted by the chef/owner.  When we told him it was our first time there, he picked up our menus and told us her would order for us.  Waiters then brought us numerous plates of the most delicious Chinese food any of us have ever eaten (veggies, beef, chicken, rice, shrimp).  The steak literally melts in your mouth, and the vegetables were incredibly tasty.  I have never tasted anything like the chicken or the shrimp dishes they prepared. All four of us liked it so much we went back two days later for a second dinner there.  Our teenagers said it was the best food they have ever eaten!!!,That's fantastic to hear, Kim! You deserve the best here with us, and I'm thrilled that your dishes really hit the spot. See you soon for more of your favorites!

Kathy, Manager"
"Splendid food, among the very best Chinese I've had. Service is maybe not for everyone's taste but the lady in charge knows what she's doing, trust her.
The dumplings' sauce was divine, the spinach salad and sweat peas were plentiful and delicious, all in all, a winner in Chinatown. We went a bit past lunchtime, which is a good time of the day, as pretty much all dinner hours, there is a line.,It's a true honor to be right at the top of your list -- so glad you found a few dishes to really enjoy! This is just what I want each guest to experience with us, so I'm pretty excited it was all just right for you. I hope we'll have the pleasure to welcome you back for another round of dumplings and salad someday! 

Until then,

"I read about this place on trip advisor so made the family come along.  Saturday night and 20 people already in the queue outside.  But through the window the food looked great.  Took 20 mins to get in and seated. Told the waiter I was gluten free and he asked if we trusted him to order for us.  Now my hubby and kids 21 and 18 were a bit oh we will be ok. But this was my treat so I said yes but need their special chicken. 

The food was amazing. Service is quick and efficient. The people next to us were regulars who told us what we got was the best dishes, and they were.  Being English we ate everything we were given but lots of people took home doggy bags.

Strongly recommended. They can do gluten free a real treat,I'm thrilled you found us and came by -- it's wonderful to hear that your dishes hit the spot for you and your family. We'd love to see you back again soon, so please keep in touch!

"I had my doubts when we arrived.  But if you don't mind the lack of hospitality/friendliness then your in for some great food!

"We visited after reading the tripadvisor reviews, however I wasn't overly impressed. The food was just ok and the service was poor - no one was friendly and it was all so rushed. We had the fried shrimp packets for starter and these were oily. The seasame chicken was nice although the sauce extremely rich. The chow mein had a different flavour to what we were used to and we weren't that keen on it. It was expensive given the style of restaurant and how quickly the meal was over and done with.,You deserve the best of the best here with us, and it's a shame to see you didn't enjoy yourself. We serve many people a day and our servers work at a very fast pace. We want to serve up our homemade dishes quickly, so it's disappointing to see you weren't a fan.

"We found this restaurant from Trip Advisor and tried it because of its rating and comments.  Boy!  Are we glad we did!  We travel extensively, and it is rare for us to return to a restaurant more than once.  The food at House of Nanking is that good.  The restaurant itself is not snazzy.  But the food is authentic and consistently good.  Be sure to try the pea pod salad and the sesame chicken.  Out of this world!  Hope to go back again someday.,Wow -- what a compliment! Thank you! We're honored to have your stamp of approval, and I hope you make it back in to see us next time you're in town.

"We phoned ahead and were told for 2 people to join the queue outside and we would get in (a queue outside a restaurant is always a good sign in SF) and true to their word after less than 15 minutes we were in, and enjoyed some of the most excellent food, based on the advice of the server. The dumplings - a favourite food of mine from many stays in Taiwan - were the best I have had anywhere. Word of warning - the portions are VERY ample for UK eaters, so do not go too crazy! Its a no thrills place - its all about the food, so no need to dress up! Would definitely visit again.,Glad we were able to impress you! the dumplings are always a favorite here, and I'm honored to know you approved. Hope to see you back again soon -- be sure to come hungry!

"I am not sure what I have been having that was called Chinese food - but I had my first real meal in Chinatown.
This place was recommended by our tour guide and a great recommendation it was!

Although it was crowded, we were seated immediately.  The owner came to greet us and asked if we had been there before- when we said no and did he have any recommendations, he said he would order for us. We were glad he did. We started with a jasmine tea - that ""bloomed"" (I took pics) - so cool, then a several course meal.  It was all exceptional. 
Prices were moderate- and we enjoyed it very much. 
You can't come to SF and not do a meal in Chinatown- and this is a great choice.,Thanks for coming to see us -- it's great to see you made your way to Chinatown! For first timers like you, our team loves coming up with combinations of dishes, so we're thrilled it was all perfect for you. Come see us again soon!

"Took this recommendation from a TA user guide to three days in SF. When you walk round Chinatown it is easy to be underwhelmed by the eateries as everything seems the same. However, keep going until you get here as is is excellent. Go early as is very busy, full of families and business people alike. Host suggested what we had and was spot on with tastes and amount? Steamed pork potstickers are excellent!!! It is really what they are called!,It's great to see all your dishes hit the spot -- thanks for a great review! We're all about serving up the best food here, and we hope you'll see us again next time you're in town!

"We had the most amazing meal at this restaurant and it was worth every penny!  The owner came over to our table and asked if we trusted him to pick our food, which of course we said yes, and then the deliciousness started arriving.  Everything was very fresh and outrageously delicious.  We started with a snap pea salad with fresh herbs and onions. Then the entrees landed on the table and, while I don't know the exact names of all of them, the garlic fish and honey sesame chicken were amazing.  The restaurant is small and loud, and it is tight quarters between the tables.   Embrace the urban dining experience!,The most amazing meal? Now that's all I could ask for! It's so wonderful we had the chance to introduce you to some new flavors and recipes -- thanks for trusting us to pick out your meal!

"Compared to Asian and Chinese food I have eaten in many different cities - this is good, but likely due to the media and TripAdvisor attention it has received, they have hiked up prices and extremely impersonal, high turnover driven service. Unimpressed,This is certainly disappointing to see here. Our goal is to get everyone served as quickly as we can, so we all work at a fast pace. We simply want to share our made-to-order dishes with as many people as we can, and it's a shame you didn't get that experience here.

"The line moves pretty quickly and the wait is totally worth it. This place is legit! We went back twice over the course of a weekend in SFO. Everything we had was amazing! Sesame chicken, salt & pepper shrimp, a fried beef dish, snap peas, a shrimp & apple dish, house fried rice, the potato cake and there was a mushroom dish too. It's all blended into a dreamy memory of deliciousness. Oh and the blossoming tea was really cool.,Glad you were wowed here -- thank you for the kind words!

Sesame Chicken with sweet potatoes, excellent, potstickers hit the spot, enedame incredible, honey shrimp with apples had me licking the plate.  Lots of more authenic dishes for those who were adventurous but the chef read us perfectly.,Glad we were able to show you a great time!

"We heard about House of Nanking from our uber driver and it was a great find. Not too long of wait time when we went at 12:45. Small restaurant with friendly seating. The owner Peter Fang saw we hadn't been there before and said he'd take care of us! He Gave our group of 4 ladies a tremendous spread of tantalizing foods. We started with a pea/ garlic/ onion appetizer. We also had the sesame chicken, Honey Beef, pork potstickers, a shrimp & apple dish, Cauliflower and sausage, all with rice and Tsingtao beer.  The only dish we didn't love was the cauliflower but were happy to try. Only reason not 5 star rating was he brought us WAY too much delicious food! would definitely go again!!,Thanks for all the feedback here! We'd never want you to leave hungry, so we love coming up with some amazing combos for you and your group! Can't wait to see you back here soon for your favorites sometime soon.

"We were searching for directions to our hotel and a local pointed us to the right direction, after which she told us that we should try House of Nan King. She was right! The food was delicious! There was a long queue when we got there but thank you for their fast service, we got seated very soon.
The boss took over and chose all the dishes for us. We do not even need the menu! 
The food tasted really good and the portions were enough for all of us. Not too much, not too little and very affordable too!  
All of us were so happy with the food and service.  It's unfortunate I did not get the boss's name. Hope to be back again! 
If you guys are adventurous enough, you should let the boss select the dishes for you, just let him know what you don't eat.

"I visited this restaurant last month with my husband and friends whilst visiting San Francisco. Not being a lover of Chinese food I was sold on the idea by my friends quoting Jamie Oliver. Be prepared for an interesting experience, despite booking we were still made to wait outside fairly abruptly. We were then seated and proceeded to order... Until our waiter told us he would order for us. We waited apprehensively until our food arrived, it was not only delicious but excellent value for money and by far our cheapest meal in San Fran. A visit here is a must, even if you are nervous about Chinese food like myself!,I'm thrilled we were able to delight you, Rebecca. I know it can seem a little abrupt here, but my team and are always thinking of you when we create a menu for you. Thanks for the kind words -- hope to see you again soon!

"Stopped in after seeing it recommended on several travel blogs and we were so glad we did. The chef stopped by to welcome us and asked if it was our first visit. When we said yes, he took our menus and said he was the chef and would take care of us. We were apprehensive but excited to give it a try. So glad we gave him the chance. We loved it all. Best fried calamari ever and fried pork dumplings started the meal- which my kids gobbled up. Then a sugar snap pea salad which was surprisingly delicious. I wanted the dressing on everything and did actually use it on some rice. Then sesame chicken and sweet potatoes, shrimp with fried apples in creamy honey sauce that we couldn't stop eating, pork ribs. Beyond delicious and really made for a wonderful experience in chinatown. Just wished I had ordered some of their steamed buns as well as I had a craving for them.,Thanks for the great review! We love seeing new faces in the door, and our chef has a great time making custom menus for you -- glad it was all perfect! Hope to see you back soon!

"We travelled across the city just to eat here after strong recommendations from some people we had met the night before. It was interesting to say the least. 

The restaurant looks a bit grim and could do with some updating but we went in anyway as it was filled with people and we hoped that the food would be worth it. 

We were seated quickly and the staff seemed friendly. We ordered some dishes that arrived quickly and the prices were reasonable. 

Everything was fresh and the sesame chicken was amazing so you should definitely try that if you pay a visit. The place was a bit disorderly and grubby looking but if you can overlook that then it's definitely worth a visit,Thanks for all the great feedback here! We're always focused on serving up phenomenal food, and we hope you'll come back for more of that sesame chicken sometime soon.

"We really enjoyed the ""chefs choice"" four course lunch offered to us.  It's not on the menu, and we had already chosen what we wanted.  So happy that we decided to go with the chefs recommendation and allowed him to ""take care of us""!,Glad that was able to wow you, Julie! We love creating custom menus, and we're glad that your chef's choice really hit the spot. Stop in for more soon!

"We came here by accident and was a little disappointed..We made out order and the waiter said he would bring out some peas aswell..little did we know we would be charged for them! 

The sesame chicken was by far the best thing we ordered, we had the chow mein with beef, it was supposed to have seasonal vegetables but it had miniscule pieces of green veg..so more like noodles with beef!

Not good value for money,It's a shame you left here disappointed with your dishes -- you mentioned some popular things, so it's a little surprising to see. We prepare each dish to order using the best ingredients around, so it's unfortunate that the beef lo mein wasn't what you were expecting. I appreciate the feedback, and I'd love another shot to wow you with the meal you deserve here.

"In town for a convention, 9 of us ventured to Chinatown for window shopping and lunch.  From a recommendation from a friend, we stopped in at the House of Nanking.  Chef Fang welcomed us at our table and asked if we had ever been there before.  When we said no, we are visiting from Nashville - he immediately took up our menus and said that he will choose our meal.  Then a wonderful experience began.  Edamame, steamed dumplings, sesame chicken, pork ribs, calamari, shrimp w/apples, beef, mushrooms, sweet potatoes - what a feast!!  Every dish was delicious and we left stuffed and happy.  Definitely a must on your chinatown visit!!,Sounds perfect all around, Diana! I'm glad Chef Fang made everything perfect for you -- you got to try some all time favorites here. Thanks for the kind words -- hope to see you back next time you're in town.

"We were two and order the calamari, noodles and dumplings, all for share. Calamari were supposed to melt in your mouth and sure they did! Dumplings were really tasty and noodles too. 
The service was ok, they work really fast, food on our table few minutes after order.
The prices were ok for a restaurant in SF. 
The place it's really simple and restrained, just lots of tables and some pictures on the walls of famous people. Some could find it too simple but I think it just follows the restaurant concept: keep it simple, order and eat delicious Chinese food fast!
For me it's a completely different Chinese restaurant, and I liked it for that :),Sounds like an awesome combination, Julia -- I'm glad everything was perfect for you! Hope to see you again for more of your favorites!

"if you are walking through Chinatown and want to eat in an authentic clean Chinese restaurant, you won't be bad to choose House of Nanking. The dishes are different from what you might be used to, since this is a family business and the menu was the creation of a brilliant chef. Service was barely ok, and I ended up eating a mystery soup that was nonetheless very good.,Thanks for the feedback here -- we're glad our dishes were able to please! Our chef loves coming up with personalized orders for you and your group, and it's great to know you enjoyed everything. Hope to see you again soon!

"The first time i came here was twenty years ago
And still today its a great dining experience
The fried rice is second to none
And over the handful of times ive visited ive learned to tell them what you like and then let them bring you out what thwy recommend
The food overall was not as good as the last time a few years back but ill be back again hopefully sometime in the future,I appreciate the feedback here! We're always listening to what customers have to say and tweaking things here and there, so this is great info to have moving forward. I can't tell you what all these years of support mean to us, and I hope you'll stop in and see us again sometime soon for more of that fried rice!

"We had the dumplings, which were excellent. 

We shared the Sesame Chicken and the Shrimp and Mushroom dish. Both were seasoned perfectly...a little zip to them but not over powering. 

Because it is popular, if there are two of you, you can expect to have two more people seated at the table next to you as though it is a four-top. The staff is not shy about table turn over. When you're done, it's time to move on. 

With that said, the food makes it worth the abrupt manner.,It seems like you had quit the spread here, so I'm delighted to see that everything was perfect for you. We love serving up as much good food as we can, as fast as we can, and we all hope to see you back here again sometime soon!

"House of Nanking, 919 Kearny Street, San Francisco

Please do not be put off this great restaurant from the outside appearance!

The customer service is very abrupt, which I think in this environment is perfectly acceptable as it is quirky and it is not done in any malicious way.

You will also be seated adjacent to potential strangers which is a great way to get chatting to other people…and this is from someone who is introvert!

The food truly amazing and true to traditional Chinese style as opposed to the ‘Westernised’ versions of your favourite dishes. They will also take off-piste requests that are not on the menu; we had a Kung Po Chicken for example.

A great find and it is also considered the best Chinese restaurant in China Town and probably San Francisco.

If you like traditional Chinese food then please try the House of Nanking.,Thanks for all the kind words here -- this review was a treat to read! I'm thrilled that your Kung Pao chicken hit the spot, and I can't wait to see you back here to try some more delicious dishes!

"Best meal we had in San Francisco.  We were recommended this restaurant and they weren't wrong.  We walked in and was asked if we had been before.  When we said no the lady said she will tell us what to have.  She asked what we didn't like then said she would get some dishes for us.  We wondered what we let ourselves in for.  Was she going to give us the most expensive dishes.  We shouldn't have worried,  This was the most flavoursome dishes and it ended up being the best and cheapest meal we had.,Best in town? WOW! That is seriously the best compliment we can think of! My team and I love putting together custom combos, especially for new guests, and it's great to see that everything was perfect for you and your group. Come see us again soon -- we'd love to have you back!

"Chinese restaurant with a viewable kitchen is a plus.  Sesame chicken was good, and I had a flowering tea.  The price is right, and it is family style dining.,That sounds like a perfect combination -- glad you were a fan of it all! Hope to see you back here soon for more of it all!

"I came to this restaurant with alot of expectantions with cheap plates and big portions, firstable they have to get a really waitress, with a fluent english or at least people who speak better english and explain their Menu, really disrespectful Asian people, now the food not impressive at all, I honestly do not recommend this restaurant at all, trust me I am not been negative I just dont want another middle class family like my to spend money on this place and have the same dissapointment like my, my family love asian food but here in southern california have better place than this, needs at least 80% of improvement this place is MUST NOT VISIT.,If you're disappointed, we're disappointed, Gerson. Our dishes can sometime be a Chinese fusion style, so it may have been different than what you're expecting. I hope you'll be able to give us another shot and we can really find dishes that are perfect for you and your family.

"Every time I visit San Francisco I eat at House of Nanking.  Why?  There is just no better Chinese food in the City, in my opinion.  The portions are hearty, very tasty and satisfying, physically and emotionally.

The scene is ""family style"" in the sense that when crowded, you will be sitting next to strangers at long tables.  The service is speedy and efficient but not particularly helpful.  So you have to make your own decisions except if the owner is there and seats you.  In that case, and I have done this, let him order for you.  You will be happy.

BTW - Cash only so no credit cards allowed.,Jon, all of us certainly love having you over, so thanks a million for making us your #1 spot. I really appreciate the fact that you get what we're all about, and I can't wait to welcome you back for more of all your favorite  dishes. 

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"This was our second visit to House of Nanking. Right after checking in to our hotel, we headed directly to the restaurant for lunch. If you want the best meal here, ask the owner lady to order for you. She will ask you couple questions and then sit back and be prepared to eat. You will get items that are not on the menu and some items that are on the menu might come out with a different twist based on how you answered her questions. We had people pointing to our table asking her what some of the dishes were.,You headed straight for us after getting settled? Now that's a true honor, and it's not one I take lightly. I'm so glad we could help you find a few tasty thing to try, and it's wonderful everything was a hit. Thanks so much for the vote of confidence, and don't be a stranger!

"This is not a fancy place, and sometimes there is a line outside.  But I have been visited the place a good number of times, and am yet to be disappointed.  The owner waits on you sometimes, and may even ""tell"" you what the special of the day is and why you should eat it!  But the food is fresh, tasteful, prepared right in front of you (I think there is a glass window), and there is enough to go around.  If you are in a group, order different kinds, and share.  It is relatively inexpensive (by SF standards), although the prices seem to be going up every visit!!,It's wonderful the meals have always been able to impress! It really makes my day to hear you can taste the quality in each bite, and I'll have to share that with the rest of the team. I hope it won't be long before we get the chance to serve up another meal to you!

"We went here while visiting San Francisco and I was a bit disappointed with the menu. The food was ok but not a big deal like it's made out to be. I have had great Chinese food on the East Coast and expected more from this place dice SF is known for great Chinese good. I am sure SF has better, so research a better spot.,I'm disappointed you weren't wowed with your dishes here, Michael. You deserve the best, and I know we can wow you with our homemade dishes.

"I had read on TripAdvisor that the owner will try to ""take care of you"" by grabbing the menus and bringing out the day's specials.  I fell for it.  It starts with an utterly average ""blossoming"" tea in a dirty mug.  Next come the entrees.  The Crackling Shrimp was quite good, but the other items were fair.  The final detail is the bill- $75 for three people for lunch .  Welcome to Chinatown. The food did seem quite fresh and not overly salted or full of MSG, but not worth $25/person. The restaurant did seem to fill up with locals (not Chinese), so it must have some good entrees.  Just don't fall for the chef's ""taking care of you"".,You deserve the best, and it's shame you weren't wowed here. I assure you there's nothing to ""fall for"" here -- our chefs prepare everything to order, so our prices reflect the handmade, high-quality dishes you'll get. We'd love another shot wow you sometime soon, and I hope you can give us another chance.

"It was about 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday. Chinatown was the final stop on our city tour, so we chose to remain in the area for dinner.
Our tour guide and driver both suggested several places, including the House of Nanking.
We began walking and saw the colorful HoN sign and decided to give the restaurant a try. 
We were seated immediately, and did not wait long for our food.
Beware: The food might not resemble the takeout from your local Chinese restaurant. But for those open to trying new things, this was a great experience.
The soup was very good. The WonTon soup included some rice and tasted a little different than I expected.
The fried calamari had a lemon taste to it -- not what one is used to after ordering calamari at Italian restaurants -- but it was very good.
Overall, the food was delicious and left us feeling like we had just eaten at an authentic Chinese restaurant.
Be aware -- the seating includes picnic-table sized tables shared by customers. My girlfriend and I were seated against a wall, so another couple at the end of our table needed to let us pass when we were leaving. Fortunately, they also were tourists and very nice about having to get up. :)
As we exited, we realized we had beaten the dinner rush by about 20 minutes. There was a line of people waiting to be seated. No surprise.,Sounds like a wonderful evening, Charles -- hope you enjoyed everything here in San Francisco! You mentioned some all time favorite dishes here, and I'm thrilled they were all a hit. Stop by again next time you're in town -- we'd love to see you back!

"I went in for a take out and ordered the house noodles with pork. They were extremely soggy and too much pepper added. The pork was really poor quality. $13 wasted as I only ate 1 spoonful. I would only rate their efficiency as the food was made promptly. I will not be eating here again.,You deserve the best from here, Nisha, and it's a shame your noodles weren't quite your taste. We'd be more than happy to recommend and create a special dish for you next time around. I'd love another shot to show you the meal you should always get from us -- all we need is a second chance.

"Had lunch and arrived right ahead of the rush.  Food was excellent!!!  Authentic tasting!  We had fried pork egg rolls for an appetizer, Sesame Chicken and Fried rice for an entree, and it was absolutely delicious.  Small place that filled up quickly.  Saw pictures of Rachel Ray and other celebrities that had eaten there.  Lots of Zagat and Tripadvisor award stickers on windows.,Glad you're such a big fan of our dishes, Janet!

"Go here purely because you want to try some great food in Chinatown. No wait lists you just stand outside the door until they have room to seat you. Smaller menu to choose from but we loved everything we had(sesame chicken, chow mien, & egg rolls) I'm a huge tea drinker and I loved the the iced berry mix they had! I saw another couple got a hot one that blossomed into a flower as it steeped which I thought was awesome! Good prices considering the high cost of SF.

"Been coming here for 20 + years and it never disappoints. It's no frills and very tight on space, so don't go here for a relaxed or romantic experience. The food is excellent and original, and served in a flash. I miss the old days when the kitchen was out front, but still wouldn't miss a trip here while in town. Dumplings and sesame chicken are my favorites, but We also tried the sizing rice veggie soup this time and it was fantastic, fresh and yummy!,Wow -- we can't tell you how much your support over the years means to us.

"I had the hot and sour soup, which to my surprise had chicken chunks in it, along with all the other usual stuff.  Large enough portion for a lunch meal or small supper.  Also had fried tofu with broccoli - huge portion.  Also tasty, but not as good as the soup.  You won't leave here hungry.  Food is good and filling, but not exceptional. I had no problem with the service. It was fast and efficient.  Just do not expect to establish a relationship with your server.  This is a very small local place, and their objective is to get people in and out quickly.  They don't rush you, but they focus on delivering fast and hot food.  They have a line of people always waiting, so I made sure to eat up and leave to make room for others.,Thanks for stopping by and enjoying our hot and sour soup so much -- what can I say? We love surprising you. It means the world to know you get what we're all about: Efficiency. I very much look forward to welcoming you back, if just for that soup you loved!

"Just to be able to taste the great flavor of the dishes, makes the clumsy, obnoxious and rude service go into oblivion. If at San Francisco, this should be a must. A lot of imagination should be put into the owner or the waiters english phrases since, not only bad spoken but rude and nasty... this is my 5th time now and it is completeley worth it.,It's great to hear the food has blown you away, Jorge!

"I went to House of Nanking after reading other reviews on here as well as seeing it in my San Francisco guidebook. I'm happy to say that the sesame chicken was excellent, as were the steamed pork dumplings. The portions were absolutely huge so I felt really bad that we wasted a lot of food. They do offer takeout boxes which is great but unfortunately we didn't have a fridge at our hotel. The service is speedy so it's great if you're in a hurry. Don't expect to sit in there for hours though. My recommendation is start with a couple of dishes and only order more once they're gone. The food comes so quick you won't be waiting long for more.,Thanks, Chrissie! I'm glad those pork dumplings and sesame chicken hit the spot for you!

"The experience was really a mix. on one hand the food i got was very good and not a bad value. also authentic chinese as far as i could tell. but it was overshadowed by the very rude service. we came in after the lunch rush and the place wasn't packed anymore but the waitress was still super stressed and hurried us to finally order something. then she practically made fun of my girlfriend because she wanted her salad without the dressing. something you would thing wasn't that much of a problem for them. from then on they never spoke a word with us again. just snatched empty plates away from us while we were still eating from others. considering all this i left a smaller tip than normal (intentionally of course). which really displeased them and they even came back with the receit and asked if i was serious about the tip (it was about 5% instead of normal 15%). when i explained myself they suggested we should better go home (being tourists and all). we took it with a smile but it's very poor customer service.,That's the last impression we want to give here -- it's never our intention to come across as rude. We're focused on a fast paced, delicious experience here, no matter what time of day, and our whole team works incredibly hard to make that happen for you and the rest of our guests.

"Our meal was tasty and served quickly on a busy Saturday night.  That being said, the employees violated so many food handling rules it was disgusting..  Servers took orders, handled money,served food and beverages, wiped down and reset tables and ate their own food with out EVER washing their hands.  How do I know this?  I faced the back kitchen/serving area and could see them all, all the time.  This was not just one or two, it was the entire house staff.  Good food or not, we won't be back.,While I'm glad you enjoyed your meal with us, Gina, it's unfortunate we didn't meet all your expectations. I assure you we're required, by law, to uphold certain food safety standards and we always keep our guests in mind. We operate at a very fast pace and it's not uncommon for our staff to do multiple tasks in succession before making it to the kitchen. I would never let my staff put our guests at risk. That being said, we'd love to have you back for more tasty Chinese cuisine in the future.

"One of my favorite restaurants.  Everything I have had here is good.  I have it on good authority that it is not authentic, Nan King is rather it's own thing with it's own recipes.  It's always busy, as a result the service isn't exactly surly, but it is brisk and to the point.  The last time I ate there was just not as good as it's been every other time, but I still recommend it with no hesitation.,While I thank you for your kind recommendation, Kitty, it's unfortunate you weren't wowed as normal with your meal the last time you stopped by. As you said, our menu is a mixture of authentic recipes that have grown and changed over time with the history of the restaurant. Thanks for spreading the word about us, I can't wait to have you back again soon!

Since 1986, our goal has been to bring San Fransisco delicious and authentic Chinese cuisine. We couldn't do what we love without amazing fans like yourself.

"Have been going to HONK for years after being referred by a Napa based friend/professional chef. Food is always top notch. If you want to go to a restaurant that has white linen and servers that a fawn over you, try somewhere else. But if you want authentic Chinese food that is delicious and not like PF Changs, go to HONK. They will also make dishes that are not on the menu if requested. Many locals frequent this restaurant, which to me tells me that it is some of the best if not THE best Chinese food around.,I'm flattered, Tim! I'm so glad your friend referred you to HON, and it's wonderful you always enjoy your meal with us.

"Service is abrupt; don't expect ""Hi, I'm Ying, and I'll be your server today."" The menu is relatively limited for a Chinese restaurant -- which actually simplifies things. The ambience is sort of Asian diner, and there's a chance you'll be sharing a table with strangers (as you would in a similar restaurant in Hong Kong or Shanghai -- been there, done that). So set all that aside and order the extra-crispy sesame chicken in a sweet sauce, any of the dumplings (the steamed pork ones in a subtly exciting black bean sauce are wondrous) and dig in. There's a reason this place on the edge of Chinatown is so busy. Portions are large, quality is undeniable, frills are nonexistent and . . . just go with it.,Serving up delicious and authentic Chinese food is our number one priority, and I'm so glad to see you truly appreciate all our hard work! It's wonderful to hear you love our dumplings and sesame chicken -- both on a list of house favorites. I can't wait to have you back soon for more tasty Nanking cuisine.

"I visited the House of Nanking with three colleagues and my daughter with a recommendation that the food was fabulous, but the service was different. We weren't disappointed. In the words of my eldest, who's travelled the world, ""that was the best Chinese meal I've ever eaton."" When we arrived the restaurant was full and the lady proprietor shouted at us to wait outside until a table became available. ""Five minutes, five minutes; you wait outside."" We got seated, five minutes later, and my colleagues suggested we just ask the restaurant to feed us without ordering; other than beers all round. They duly did. The service was swift, and mildly amusing, and the food was great. It started with the best dumpling soup I've ever had and continued with prawn, chicken and pork courses, and all were great. I''ve eaten in Hong Kong a lot and this food was the best Chinese I've had; perhaps they catered for our western palates, but if they did we appreciated their choices for us. The restaurant was fairly utilitarian and don't be put off by the pictures of Jamie Oliver on the wall. I'm sure he enjoyed his meal too. Fantastic food, swift, but unbrupt service; which we all enjoyed, and good value.,Serving up delicious and authentic Chinese food is our number one priority, David! I'm so happy to hear the best Chinese cuisine you've had is with us. It's great that you all enjoyed the dishes your servers brought you, and I hope to see you guys all return to try more of our menu!

Until next time ,

"I had some spare time before a morning meeting in San Francisco and decided to give HoN a try, after a recommendation from a friend. I was on my own and was expecting to stand in a lineup but promptly got seated a table with strangers. Which is fine, I got  seated. In fairness, in many other restaurants, if you dine alone, you'll be that close to other diners so it's not a big deal. 

So the negative things that some reviewers have written are not too exaggerated. The servers are not terribly friendly and the decor isn't mind-blowing, but it's pretty much in line with what I was expecting, and not really out of line for similar restaurants. 

I found the servers were not rude and they were very efficient and at least we didn't have to have insincere discussions about how I am doing today. 

I ordered the sesame chicken and the onion cakes, and when other reviewers say it's amazing, it really is! The sesame chicken is the best Chinese dish I have ever had. The food is so good, that even if the servers were like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, I'd still go back.,I'm so glad you took your friend's recommendation, Michael! Our number one priority here is bringing you delicious and authentic Chinese cuisine. I appreciate you taking the time to write a review and am thrilled you enjoyed your sesame chicken -- it's definitely a house favorite. I hope you (and your friend too) stop by back again soon!

Until next time, 
Kathy, Manager"
"This is a great neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  It does seem like it has lost a bit of its authenticity as its popularity has increased.  I went by myself but did not feel alone as the tables are long, narrow and crowded - I sat with a group of strangers.  The food was very good.,Thanks for taking the time to spread the word about us, Helen. I'm glad you stopped by and were able to enjoy some delicious Chinese cuisine with us. It's awesome to know you enjoyed your meal -- that's our number one priority. I hope to see you back again soon!

Until next time,

"Their sesame chicken is to die for.  Our group of six was sat quickly for lunch and the service was attentive and quick.  The food was awesome as was the flowering tea.  If you are eating in China town I suggest you stop in!,Serving up delicious and authentic Chinese food is our number one priority, and it's wonderful to know you appreciate all our hard work! The Sesame Chicken is definitely a house favorite -- I'm so glad you enjoyed it. Thanks for spreading the word about us, I can't wait to have you stop back by!

"We went here for dinner during a recent vacation to SF and were very glad indeed that we did.  Basically, it's all about the food: if you want to have a seriously good Chinese meal which won't cost the earth, then head here.  British visitors might be initially surprised by the restaurant's vibe: unlike in most UK Chinese restaurants, the House of Nanking has much more of a canteen feel to it, and you'll sit at an unfussy table (sometimes with other people) and be served promptly by the staff who are very busy and deal with you with curt efficiency.  The three dishes we ordered came at different times, and this might put off some travellers; but if you go with the vibe, as we did, you will not regret it.  We ordered the sesame seed chicken dish, some spicy shrimp and a plate of fried rice, all to share.  The shrimp came first and was terrific: tasty, spicy in the best sense, and plentiful.  The star of the show was the chicken dish which was one of the best dishes of its kind I've tasted anywhere in the world.  The rice arrived when we were half-way through these 'mains', but that was fine and indeed quite welcome.  By a weird coincidence we saw the crew from our flight having dinner at the table behind us (!) so clearly the reputation of the House of Nanking is widespread; and on the evidence of our visit, it's totally deserved.  So my advice to you is: queue to get a table if you have to, smile at the people you'll probably be seated right next to, accept that the staff are extremely busy (although they'll not forget to take your order or serve you: the service was great), and focus wholly on the food.  You won't regret it.  We didn't, and if we ever get back to SF, we'll be heading here first.,Serving up delicious and authentic Chinese food is our number one priority, and it was a pleasure to read how much you appreciated all our hard work! It awesome to hear you were so impressed by our Sesame Chicken -- it's definitely a house favorite. Thanks for spreading the word about us, I really appreciate it. I hope you enjoyed your time in San Fran, and can't wait to have you back again the next time you're visiting the area!

Safe travels,

"I cannot even rate the food because we left. This place has the most awful people running it, I do not know how they stay on business. It was stifling hot in there. When we asked to be seated, they grunted in the direction of a table and threw menus down. When we asked if they had a high chair, we were yelled a no and then the woman made some sort of spitting gesture at the floor. There are so many places to eat that it is ridiculous to pay for that kind of treatment.,I'm sorry you had such a negative experience with us, Miriam. Our number one priority is brining our guests tasty and authentic Chinese cuisine -- it's a bummer you weren't able to give it a try. While my staff is efficient and doesn't waste time with formalities, I have never heard the kind of behavior you witnessed. I assure you the woman you mentioned would never spit at or in the vicinity of any of our guests. Although I wasn't there to see it, it seems like there may have been a misunderstanding. I hope you can put this experience behind you and give us another shot to make it up to you. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"This is a very casual place, typical of many Asian restaurants Where there is high turnover and crowded seats.  For its type, it was perhaps the best ever.  In our experience it lived up to its hype.

We shared three dishes, the green beans (my date's choice), shrimp and mushrooms (my choice), and a ginger beef kind of dish served with bok choy (the server's suggestion).  These were all spectacular (least of all my choice, but it was still exceptionally good).  I can still taste the beef.  This all cost us not much more than $40 with rice and tea.  Eat here! The lineup looked long at first but we were seated quickly.,Serving up great tasting authentic Chinese food is our number one priority. I'm so glad you and your date enjoyed the ginger beef recommended by your server. Thanks for the rave review,  I can't wait to have you guys back for more!

Until next time,

"Me and my wife rocked up, was put at a table with 2 strangers, said my was GF, the lady(waitress) pretty much ordered for us, and that set the tone, was a great meal extremely tasty.,It's great you and your wife really enjoyed your meal with us, Scotty! Serving great food is always our number one priority, I'm so glad to see our hard work pays off. I can't wait to have you both back again soon!

"There are so many restaurants to choose from in Chinatown.  So we relied on internet reviews to narrow it down.  We are so glad we tried House of Nanking.  The server recommended their cauliflower dish.  We also ordered chow mein and garlic fish.  It was all so yummy that we ate it all.  Every time a plate came out for other guests, it was hard not to stare and wish we ordered those plates too.  So we'll be back for more!,As you know, online reviews mean the world to local places like us, so thank you for taking the time to share a few words about your experience, Christine! I'm thrilled you loved your chow mein and garlic fish -- as well as the dishes your server suggested to you. I can't wait to have you visit again for more Nanking fun. 

If you had to choose a favorite, which dish did you enjoy the most?

"We were here in S.F. for a Giants game and I had read about this restaurant and wanted to try it.  Being that we were here on the weekend, we timed it so that we would eat a very late lunch/early dinner and arrived after 3 p.m.  Got right in and maybe one or two tables were occupied.  The waiter recommended any soup and the sesame chicken as what we should have as I said I wanted a light meal for the two of us.  We also had steamed rice.  Our soup was the war wanton and it was really delicious.  Kind of a milky color and the prawns and dumplings were very flavorful, but that broth has really stuck with me as being truly wonderful.  It also had a lasting tingle of peppery heat to it.  The sesame chicken was slightly sweet, salty with soy and had a really nice crunch  to it and was served with thin slices of garlicky chayote and sweet potato.  Our beverage was water (and for those travelers who think San Francisco water needs to be filtered, don't be concerned.  It is probably the best water you will get in the U.S. and comes all the way from the Sierra Nevada mountains and is clean and good).  The menu is quite short and not confusing so give it a try.  Yeah, the restaurant could use a bit of dusting and is quite spare, but the focus is the food, and we found it to be very, very tasty.  Our bill, including steamed rice which was extra, was $20 w/out taxes/tip.,You're totally right when you said our main focus is on our food, Ed! I'm thrilled you enjoyed your soup and sesame chicken -- we have a real passion for what we do here and I''m so glad we were able to share that with you. I can't wait to see you guys again soon to try more of our menu! 

Until then,
Kathy, Manager"
"If you can communicate or relate with the staff. 

There's a Chinese menu and English menu. We asked for suggestions based on the Chinese written menu since we can speak it only and couldn't read.

We shared a homemade soup and it was the real deal...Excellent flavor, portion and ingredients. It was our first meal after we landed in SF. It is Priced appropriately as well but we would of never known if we ordered from the English menu.,The real deal?? I'm flattered, Marvin! It's great to know you enjoyed your soup along with the rest of your meal. I hope you enjoyed your time in San Fran and can't wait to have you back again the next time you're in the neighborhood!

Safe travels,
Kathy, Manager"
"We enjoyed the "" house special sesame chicken""  and the sizzling rice soup .. This 2 seems to be what everyone ordered. So many celebrities chef came here as witnessed on the wall. Interesting that no Asians were there the night we were there. My wife was really upset when the waitress said in Chinese that we only ordered 3 dishes, ( implying that we are cheap) . It was 8:30 p.m. We had just arrived in San Francisco and had a late lunch at 5 . She didn't know we understand Chinese. Advise to any waiters: do not judge.... Your are there to serve...,While i'm glad you enjoyed your meal with us, I wish you had had a more pleasant experience with your server. Thanks for the candid feedback, I'll be sure to take it back to my team. I assure you your server meant no harm by the statement, and I'll be addressing the issue. I hope you return the next time you're in the area so we can have the opportunity to wow you like I know we can.

Until next time,
Kathy, Manager"
"The food is not good enough to make up for the rude service. There is nothing visually attractive about this place and it feels dirty. I think the water comes right out of the tap unfiltered but you'll only get one glass anyway. I think most of the business are tourists--our hotel recommended it. The awards on the walls are from the 90s--nothing recent--probably the last time it was cleaned. If you're going to be in the service industry make an effort to provide decent service.,It's a bummer you didn't enjoy your time with us. I assure you we have to meet certain health code standards and that cleanliness is of the utmost importance to us. As for our service, we are known to be up-front and attribute that to our number one priority -- getting you fresh and delicious Chinese cuisine. We normally have a lengthy wait out the door and commit to reaching everyone who is waiting. Turning tables is important to us, and it's unfortunate our pace wasn't what you were expecting. I hope down the road you'll consider giving us another shot to wow you. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Wonderful lunch here in Chinatown! Probably the best I have had in years, if ever. The pork pot stickers were yumscious, the sesame chicken a delight. Wash it down with a bottle of Tsingzao beer and you will leave a happy person. It is no frills and they don't want you hanging around, but a really good pit-stop.,Our dishes have been called the bomb-diggity and maybe even a described as heavenly, but yumscious is a new and welcomed word into our vocab, Emma! We're so glad you always enjoy your pot stickers and sesame chicken time and time again. I can't wait to see you back for more tasty Chinese cuisine!

How long have you been coming to us for your pot-sticker fix?

Looking forward to finding out, 
Kathy, Manager"
"There was no kind or warm welcome, Heck there wasn't even a hello he just pointed where to our seat? The staff only will say what they need to quickly, not once did we get a smile. We ate here 4 times during the weekend because the 1st meal was great & we wanted to try the whole small menu. Start with the tall mug of cleansing tea, it's a bit sweet but worth it. Every thing we ate was delicious! It's just a huge disappointment that the staff is so unwelcoming, Our next visit we will try for a more friendly atmosphere.,I'm so glad you visited not just once, but four times in one weekend! It's great you loved all your meals -- especially that sweet cleansing tea. One of our top priorities is getting you seated and delicious food to your table -- we run a tight ship here and have to keep the ball rolling. But I appreciate your feedback and will share it with the rest of my team. I hope you return for more tasty Chinese food the next time you're in the area!

Until then,

"Service was rude and rushed.  Food was just ok, and was expensive for what it was.  Lunch for 4 was $62.00, and we only ordered four items to share.  Beef was fatty, and the chicken was all dark meat.,It's a bummer you weren't wowed by your visit with us. We're really passionate about Chinese cuisine and our main priority is getting good food to your table. Our environment and cuisine isn't for everyone -- we understand their are many different palates and we can't please them all. But we hope you'll consider giving us another try down the road. 

All the best, 
Kathy, Manager"
"The food was great!! We had the sesame chicken and the pork egg rolls. The best Chinese food I have ever had! There was already a line forming on Sunday before they opened at 12:00 and now I know why!,Can't beat the sesame chicken and pork egg rolls! We're honored to hear we're the best Chinese food you've ever had. What a compliment! 

Cheers, 
Kathy, Manager"
"This seems to be a SF China Town institution, complete with T-shirts and a line out the door.  The menu is small but has traditional Chinese-American dishes.  We loved the salt and pepper shrimp.  It's rushed and crowded but fun.,I'm glad you enjoyed your salt and pepper shrimp, Gary! We're passionate about what we do here and love to share that passion with our guests. I'm happy to hear you had a fun time with us and can't wait to see you again soon!

Until next time,

"This is a tourist spot that serves OK food, nothing more or less. Do yourself a favor and search out other spots for Asian food. Food was very bland and needed gobs of chili paste to give it some zing.,It's unfortunate you weren't a fan, it's rare we can't find anything for our guests to enjoy. While I'm glad you stopped by, if we had known you wanted something spicy, the kitchen could've gladly accommodated your request. I hope you consider giving us another try when you're in the area. That way we can have the opportunity to wow you like I know we can.

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant is still recommended by many and you will wait during meal hours. Unless you have 6 or 8'you will seat with others but never a problem.  The place is small but classic Chinese.  I had the hot and sour soups and salt and pepper shrimp.  The soup was good but not as good as in the past. It had English peas that were a bit cold in the soup.  The shrimp dish was excellent but way too many mushrooms for me.  The service is quick and efficient.  Good place.,Thanks for the feedback, Rob -- it's always appreciated! I'm glad that all in all, you enjoyed yet another great experience with us. That's all I could ask for! 

I hope to welcome you back for more of all your favorite dishes sometime soon.

Best,

"Went here with a group of 4.  We were all happy with our meals, but, I don't think anyone would say they remembered it for the food.  The restaurant was very small, many groups were seated together.  

Our waitress came out with waters for the table and each water had some kind of ""floatie"" particles in it.  After much debate, we decided that it was likely dish soap that didn't get fully cleaned out, which was better than the alternative.  However, in a top 100 restaurant in San Francisco, I don't expect to have that in my water.  Luckily, I got the house wine, so I didn't have to worry about it.  

We shared multiple entrees including pepper shrimp (really good), breaded beef (really good), and a few chicken dishes which were fine.  The soup for apps was fine as well.  Again, the food was good, just not amazing by any means.  If the place was cleaned up a bit, it would definitely be a place to visit.  However, price for the quality of food was great.  Don't think I'd bother going back with so many other options in town (unless I had a massage scheduled next door.)  ;),Thanks for taking the time out of your day to let us know what you enjoyed about your experience, and what you feel we could have done better -- your feedback is always appreciated. 

I'm sorry about the soap residue left in your glasses, but please know that I will be making sure this doesn't happen again. You shouldn't ever have to deal with inconvenience like that. 

I'm glad you and your group enjoyed your meals, and considered us a value-for-money experience. I hope to one day welcome you back, and really impress you. You deserve it.

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Super real authentic great food, hot/sour soup was great, fried rice & sesame chicken were amazing, pork dumplings were all awesome - very fair priced.,Madison, thanks for that perfect rating -- it's all I could ever ask for, and more!

It means so much that you continue to enjoy your meals and experiences with us time and time again.

"After reading the reviews, my husband and I went to this place for dinner. The food was delicious. We ordered Fried pork potstickers, Chicken noodles and Nanking Sesame Chicken for $35 and the portion was big and the food was delicious. I definitely advise to try their Sesame Chicken. 
This place is just opposite to Hotel Zoetrope, the green building on the corner which all tour bus cover as a part of their trip. This hotel is owned by Francis Ford Coppola, the director of the movie series The Godfather. 
If you love chinese food, this place is definitely worth a visit. Don't expect it to be a fancy place, but this little restaurant has it's own charm.,I'm thrilled you love and recommend our Sesame Chicken! It's definitely a popular choice. I'm so glad you enjoyed your visit with us, and thank you for spreading the word. I hope to see you again soon for more tasty Chinese food.

Until next time, 
Kathy, Manager"
"The sesame chicken is very good.  The steamed rice which is an extra charge was crunchy.  My son got a wonton soup and he said it was okay.  We left still being hungry and wanting some really good Hunan or Schezuan.,While I'm glad you enjoyed the sesame chicken, I wish we could've wowed you with the rest of your meal. Our authentic Chinese recipes are built from the history of restaurant, and may differ from the Chinese food you're familiar with. That being said, I would never want anyone to leave still hungry or dissatisfied with their meal. I hope you give us the opportunity in the future to wow you like I know we can!

Until next time,

"The House of Nanking looks like a hole in the wall kind of place. I would have never tried it if a friend from home hadn't told us to be sure to go there. Tell the waiter what you like and the chef will create a dish special for you. It was fabulous.,I'm so glad your friend recommended us to you! Thanks for stopping by. It seems like you really enjoyed your visit, and I can't wait to have you back for more authentic Chinese food sometime soon! 

Can't wait,
Kathy, Manager"
"Ever notice Chinese food restaurants have the most extensive menus? Well, House of Nanking. Small place, community style tables and an abbreviated menu. 1 chicken dish- sesame chicken, about 12 entrees to choose from and not the usual suspects. But, everything on the menu is delicious and memorable. The restaurant is cramped, small and a bit of a dive, but amazing food. Recommend pork dumplings, egg rolls, onion pancake and sesame chicken. Food arrives quickly and wait staff is attentive. Enjoy!,Although we don't have a million dishes to choose from, we really know how to do the ones we do serve, Dawn! Thanks so much for the kind words. It's great to know you always enjoy your meal when you stop by. I hope to see you again soon the next time you're in the neighborhood! 

Until then,
Kathy, Manager"
"Would you pick the Nanking above other restaurants in Chinatown? Probably not by passing by in the street but if you follow the TripAdvisor reviews and recommendations from local people, this is the place to head for. Absolutely delicious freshly cooked yummy food that can't be faulted. And very good value too amongst some of the dearer places in SF.
But dont leave it too late as they stop serving at 9.00pm.,Thanks so much for the kind reviews and the recommendation! I'm thrilled you love our fresh, authentic Chinese cuisine and hope to see you again soon for more!

"Don't judge this book by the cover.   You may need to wait in line for a few minutes but what awaits is some of the best Chinese food in San Fran in this local dive.  Everything is good except the wine which comes in a box.,I'm thrilled our food is always worth your wait, Caleb! I'm honored to have earned your badge of ""best Chinese food in San Fran"" and can't wait for you to stop by again soon!

"My wife and our 8mo old daughter visited here for an early dinner.  The sesame chicken and potstickers were great, the calamari and shrimp packets were good.  Steamed rice is extra and doesn't come with your selection. The place is small, so keep that in mind as there isn't a lot of room for big parties/strollers/etc.

Recommended if you are near Chinatown and looking for some good Chinese food.,I'm so happy you and your wife enjoyed our Sesame Chicken and potstickers! I'm honored to have earned your recommendation, and hope to see you guys then next time you're in Chinatown! 

Until next time,

"Food is delicious and very faithful to Chinese cuisine. This is why you find this restaurant always full and a lot of costumers waiting outside for a table. Menu is varied and there's an option for everyone: chicken, pork or shrimps...
The staff is a little bit rude but you can handle it. You can't miss the Nanking emblematic tea: a huge jar of a tasty infusion of tea, fruits and hibiscus.,I'm so glad you always enjoy our authentic Chinese cuisine, Laura! I hate to hear that you've experienced rude customer service and will be sure to bring it to my team's attention. I hope to see you the next time you're in the area!

"I went with my wife and friends to this restaurant on the afternoon of the San Francisco Chinese New Year parade- so the  streets were packed with people since this restaurant is along the parade route.  Despite the crowd, my friends went early and got a table.  Food was very good and came out quickly.  Service was understandably hurried and short but we got what we wanted quickly and efficiently.  We also saw that they quickly accommodated a party of 12.  In that crazy atmosphere, where the waiting customers were trying to hurry us out of the place, I thought the service people did a fantastic job-- I would of lost it a long time ago!!,I'm so glad even though you stopped by during a busy time that you enjoyed your time with us, Warren! From the food to our customer service, it seems like you really enjoyed yourself. I hope to have you back again the next time you're in the area!

Until then,

"Went to this particular restaurant because of the review on trip advisor but the service was never mentioned. The waitress were rushed when she came to my table and was distracted while taking our order. We only got as far as ordering appetizers because the waitress just wouldn't give us eye contact for us to finish our order, we were a party of two and only one of our orders came out.  
They seem to cater to the Caucasians and Asians, we couldn't even get a glass of water at our table and when we tried to ask them for the other order they just ignored us, that is until we pulled out our wallets to pay, then we had all the smiles and great attention from the staff. I would never go back there. Horrible customer service,I'm truly concerned about your experience with us. I would never want you to feel ignored or neglected as a guest and assure you that was not your servers intention. I'll bring your experience to the attention of the rest of my team -- along with the importance of quality customer service no matter how busy the we are. I hope you'll consider giving us another shot to wow you in the future with our authentic Chinese cuisine!

Sincerely, 
Kathy, Manager"
"The House of Nanking was recommended to us by several friends who described it as a 'must visit' in San Fransisco.  
We were staying near Union Square and walked into the heart of China Town which was a good experience.  We had to queue which we were expecting and didn't mind.  It went in quickly as the turn over is quite quick.  We were directed to a long table and sat next to a family of 4.  We I ordered a beer and my partner a glass of wine (which was ok) neither chilled but I was there for the food and experience.  We orders a couple of appetisers and mains.  Surprisingly the food came as it was cooked in a random order.  It certainly was unique but the best bit was that the food is authentic and was excellent.  We shared al the dishes and left exceptionally satisfied and all for under $50 in total.  Not only was the experience great it was also the cheapest meal we had in an otherwise dear city.  Is fast and furious and not for romance but definitely oozes character and authenticity.  When we return to San Fransisco we will without doubt visit again.  
Thanks to the staff for a brilliant experience.,I'm so glad you both enjoyed our authentic Chinese cuisine and atmosphere! It's great to know we made your visit to San Fran that much more special, and I can't wait to have you both back the next time you're in the area!

"Went on the recommendation of our concierge at the Hilton. Zagat ratings all over the door.  Ordered their Nanking Chicken, House Noodles, potstickers.  Wasn't overwhelmed by it.  Steamed rice is extra per person.

I took it to go.  Staff and service are fine. It's a small shop.  I do recommend but not craving any of the dishes I had.,Thanks so much for giving us a try, Jake! While you weren't completely wowed by the dishes you had, I'm confident you could find something you'll find yourself craving long after you leave. I hope the next time that you're in the area you'll consider giving us another try!

Until then,

"I was TOLD to go here by a friend.  Kinda seedy part of town (witness the underground Thai ""Health"" Spa next door!).  Seating is mostly community style--long tables and they'll seat you anywhere there's a spot.  Stacked boxes of Tsing Tao beer surround the kitchen. I ordered a beer (don't expect a chilled glass). Very little decor. Nothing elegant or particularly attractive. 
My friend said I ""MUST"" order Shrimp Pancakes and Sesame Chicken....and anything else I would want (....why would I want more than that?). I saw a pic online of the Salt, Pepper and Mushroom Shrimp, though, and got that instead.  Shrimp Pancakes arrived fast and two bites later the entree arrived.  Meanwhile a couple next to me ordered Sesame Chicken and offered me some!  How perfect.  
Everything I ate was spectacular.  Yes.....really!  
I hear there are often lines....I got lucky and walked right in.  If you are looking for glamour, stylish ambience, meticulous service and decor - go elsewhere.  Service was satisfactory, people are happy, and the joint is jumpin.....but the FOOD just brings this place to the top. .  It is really great!  OH did I mention that I stuffed myself for under $30?  I am so glad my friend 'made' me go.,I would love to give your friend a big hug for sending you our way! I'm so happy you love our busy atmosphere and Sesame Chicken. I hope to see you again soon for more of that Salt, Pepper, and Mushroom shrimp along with more fun times!

Until next time,

"Fantastic food, just order and its there, the staff are great and friendly, the service was fast and the food was very tasty you can order from the menu or ask what you would like, we found it to be very nice and a great place to eat, you have to try it.,Roy, thanks for being a fan -- I love having you over! I appreciate your recommendation, and hope to see you again soon. All of your favorite dishes will be here waiting for you!

"Wasn't sure what to expect as it isn't the most pleasing on the eye from the outside! But don't let that fool you!

Food was fantastic!! Big portions so could easily be shared! Fairly priced and good service even though it was very busy! 

We recommend and would return!!,Thanks for not judging a book by its cover -- we sure have been around for a while, but that doesn't mean we're doing any less in the kitchen! I'm so glad you enjoyed your meal with us so much in terms of both flavor and portion sizes, and I sure hope I'll be getting the chance to welcome you back sooner than later!

Kindest regards,

"I've been here several times & this is my first review. First off it is always a must stop restaurant every time I go to the Bay Area, (SF). We've always been met by the owner. There is a great staff too. They have menus but I highly suggest you tell them what allergies you may have if any & what you are in the mood for, i.e. beef, chicken, seafood, etc. Let them bring out to you whatever they recommend. Then sit back & wait for the most incredible chinese infused dish you have ever tasted in your life! House of Nanking NEVER disappoints! It's is a melody of deliciousness that bursts in your mouth!
It's located in the red light district. Parking is scarce. We go late or early lunch & it is not as busy. There can be a line to get in at times because it's so good but definitely worth the wait. Cost $$. 
We went twice in our visit to SF this time. We asked for an extra dish.
1st time this visit party of 3: Soup, Appetizer, (2) Main Dish,+ extra dish & drinks paid $150 w/tip. 
2nd visit same trip party of 2: Soup, Appetizer, Main dish + extra dish & drinks paid $85. You can order directly off menu & get soup or appetizer one entree & drink for about $30,Thanks for being a long term fan of ours -- it means the world to read this review of yours! I appreciate all your kind words of support, and hope to continue welcoming you back for that melody of deliciousness you enjoy so much. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"We knew all about Nanking before we had even left for the USA. Many of our friends referred it as a 'must do' whilst in San Fran.

When we got to SF, a lot of locals told us it wasn't worth the hype, that they just spend loads of money on marketing...well, we ignored the haters and boy were we glad!! They've got to get the money for the marketing from somewhere right??...

The food was delicious! I'm talking delicious quality you'd expect from a real Chinese resturant. Now don't go here thinking your coming across a 5 star restaurant, this is an authentic rough looking resturant in the heart of San Frans china town, it's all about the atmosphere! The place was filled with laughs, cheers, and food and beer flowing everywhere! The food was full of flavour but surprisingly easy on the stomach, there wasn't the typical oily overdose as one would expect.

The place was busy but the customer service was still satisfactory, we had a great time and had to resist the urge to go back so we could explore the rest of SF's offerings!!,Thanks for ignoring the haters, Matty -- I sure loved having you over for a delicious meal. It's awesome to know you enjoyed our atmosphere so much. We love knowing you fit right in among the hustle and bustle of our restaurant, and were able to taste a bunch of different dishes. I hope I'll be seeing you again sometime sooner than later.

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"At the urging of a friend, I went to restaurant for the first time.  I was craving won ton soup and they did not disappoint!  It was very unique and not your typical carry out type. The broth was white and the won tons themselves were very tender. The hot tea was fabulous and so was each dish that was sampled.  The cauliflower dish was the most unique of all and so tasty.  Sesame chicken and rice were also a treat.  Back home, I still do miss the won ton soup and wish I could find a restaurant to make it as they do.  Service was prompt and the manager greeted every visitor with enthusiasm.  It was busy, but felt like a place where family gathers.  Can't wait to return next time I'm in the city.,Thank you so much for taking the time to write this up! I'm glad your friend recommended us and that we did not disappoint! We are all looking forward to the next time you are in town.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"We went there while on holiday in San Francisco in Sept 2015 on the recommendation of a colleague who said it was the best chinese she had ever had, and she wasn't lying! We asked for the chef's recommendation and were not disappointed, the food was fantastic, particularly some kind of beef dish which really was amazing (it was pieces of beef which were very dark in colour, with a slightly crispy outer and a lovely sweet taste to it). We were so impressed and vocal about it that the couple next to us asked for a plate of it too! It was also extremely good value in a city we found to be quite expensive for food. The queue gets big so get down there early!

I have no idea what the name of this dish is, so Nanking please advise so I can enjoy it again!!,Best Chinese food you've ever had? Now that's truly a compliment I don't take lightly. Thank you so much for the kind words on the beef -- I hope we'll get to welcome you back for another order next time you're nearby! 

Best wishes, 
Kathy, Manager"
"Very good and fast service. Almost all foods are very tasty and eatable:) Must to do in Sf China Town. Don't expect too much about 5* restaurants hospitality. Not too much baby friendly. We couldn't find high chair.,I'm happy to see you enjoyed our food so much, Aydin, but am disappointed that our hospitality didn't seem to be on point the last time you stopped by. We're always trying to do better, so the next time you're in the area, we hope you'll stop in!

Sincerely, 
Kathy, Manager"
"After a long walk in china town we discovered this place. Had the chef recommendation and couldn't say which plate was best... a must in San Francisco,I'm glad our recommendations managed to impress you so much, Manuel. We really love providing the best service and food possible, so seeing your review really means a lot! Thank you for taking the time to write this up!  

Sincerely, 
Kathy, Manager"
"I live in a suburb of San Francisco and found this place over 25 years ago.  It has been our go-to Chinese restaurant for those 25 years.  We have taken all of our friends and family members who visit us to the House of Nanking and all thought it was outstanding. We no longer order from the menu, we ask the owner (Peter) when he is there to order for us.  We tell him what type of protein we want (fish, chicken, pork, etc) and he brings out fabulous dishes.,We are honored you have been such dedicated patrons for the last 25 years! Hearing from our regulars really means a lot, and we're grateful for the friends and family you have introduced to our cuisine. We're looking forward to another 25 years of serving you!

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"For my 40th birthday my husband surprised me with a trip to San Francisco and for dinner we visited House of Nanking. It's a small place but a definite treasure and I was thrilled. The food is simply delicious and I've been thinking about it since then...especially the fruit tea!  If we didn't live in Arizona I would have been back again already. Can the tea be replicated or ordered?! I need this tea!,I'm so glad you had such a great time with us during your 40th birthday trip, Therese! Providing our guests with great memories is what we strive to do, and it sounds like we did not disappoint. We're not currently shipping our tea, but I'm sure that if you visit your local Asian market, they will be able to help you find what you are looking for. We hope to see you in again the next time you're in town.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"House of Nanking is one of the most popular restaurants in Chinatown, so there is often a line.  However, it is worth the wait.  The food is terrific and the service is fast.,I'm so happy we're living up to our reputation! We know we can get pretty busy from time to time, so thank you for being patient with the line. We're looking forward to seeing you in again soon.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"We had the house noodles, pork dumplings and the ginger chicken.All were incredible and came out of the kitchen fast!! Totally worth the wait. The staff aren't super helpful or chatty, the place is crazy busy so they really didn't have time for that but they were polite and efficient. And the food..... So worth it.,Thank you so much for taking the time to post this review. The pork dumplings and ginger chicken are popular dishes, and I am so glad you enjoyed them. We can get pretty busy, and I appreciate your patience. We're looking forward to having you in again soon.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"The food tastes fresh and overall good, at a very good price. But who can enjoy eating anything when the waiters act like they're racing to push you out the door. The seating is close -- hard to fit dishes on your table, and if you don't fill the grouped-together seats with your own party you'll find the strangers seated with you leaning over your food. Here's how to deal with that if you really need to brave this place for an inexpensive meal: go in a group of 6 and order only a couple of dishes at a time.,We're always trying to provide prompt and effective service to our guests, and I am sorry if that gave you the impression that we were trying to hurry you. I can assure you we never want any of our guests to feel as though they are being rushed! We try to maintain the atmosphere of a traditional Chinese restaurant, but we understand that filling tables and tight seating arrangements might be new to some of our guests. We're sorry if you felt uncomfortable at any time.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"This place looks like a dump, but people were lined up to get in.  Tables are crowded together and you might even share a table with others.  However, the food was worth the wait and the prices nominal.  Service was fast but impersonal. However, you know that it is good when several groups around you are speaking Chinese. Again, worth the wait.,We're so glad you stuck out the wait, Ken! We try to provide an authentic atmosphere for our guest's dining experience, so we're glad that you picked up on our unique approach. We're looking forward to having you back again soon.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"I ate here about 10 years ago and loved it and was a little nervous that it would still be great - but it is still great! I love their soups and the egg rolls (which I usually don't even like but hubby ordered) were fantastic. If you want to eat in Chinatown this is the place.,I am so glad that we have kept up the quality you remembered 10 years ago! We have been in Chinatown a long time and the fact that we get people like you coming back after so long and still feel excited about our cuisine really means a lot to us. Thank you for taking the time to write this up.

Kathy, Manager"
"Of course it's in iconic Chinatown. Seats maybe 50 people and fills up fast. Staff are friendly but seem to be in a rush to get you ordered, fed, and out the door. House chicken with sweet potatoes is perfectly crispy with just the right amount of sauce, garlic beef is really tender and flavorful. Chow mein is okay. Hot fruit tea is exactly what it sounds like and is a bit overpriced. The high ratings on the critic sites plus the posted awards on the windows set you up for a much greater expectation which unfortunately is detrimental to the restaurant.,The high rating you left for us is very much appreciated, but I am, of course, sorry we did not live up to your expectations. We want every guest that walks through our doors to be impressed with every aspect of their experience. Every effort will be made to improve in every way. -Kathy, Manager"
"We made a special trip into SF while visiting CA to go to China town and definitely had to go to the House of Nanking!  3 generations of our family call this a favorite!  They have a way of making every dish special.  The surroundings are just okay and the service as well.. But the food is SO good',We truly care about what we do, caelove, so seeing that your whole family enjoyed our cuisine really means a lot! That being said, I'm sorry that our service and ambiance did not impress as much as our food. We take our guest's satisfaction very seriously and will be doubling our efforts to deliver the best service and well as food possible.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"I love Asian food but this place is really bad. The waiters put hands inside cup we drink and before he was picking his nose. When they clean their hands they use the same rags they clean table with. I don't see how this place is in business!!! I'd give them a 0 over all. Don't get their noodles or soup. And checked not cooked all the way.,Sorry for leaving you with a subpar impression of us -- the description of your experience with us is just unacceptable, so please know I will be taking your comments very seriously. Customer satisfaction is our number one priority, and I'd like nothing more than to prove that to you.

Thank you,
Kathy, Manager"
"We hadn't visited ""the house that Peter built"" in a few years & had heard there was some drop off in quality...RUBBISH! The pork chops, pork stuffed mushrooms, sesame chicken & wok'd green beans were truly delicious! One highlight was to see how much our 6 year old enjoyed her first taste of sesame chicken (she loved it). Our only wish was that we were w a bigger group so we could have tried more dishes. 

This is an authentic casual Chinese dining experience. Expect good food fast, not warm & fuzzy servers & spacious seating. Incredible food & cold Tsing Tao...what more can you ask for?!?,Thank you for an amazing review -- what a joy it was to read, and share with the rest of the team! I'm so glad you enjoyed each dish you were served, because that really is all I could ever want for you! Come back soon, and when you do, come with a big crowd so that you can order as much as your heart desires!

Can't wait to see you again,
Kathy, Manager"
"There's a reason for the long line outside this restaurant every night: the food is excellent. We had a plate of chow mien and  pepper shrimp with mushrooms. Both were fabulous. The kitchen was fast. We could overlook the crowdedness of the restaurant but the behavior of the waitress really put us off. She made us feel like our being there was an inconvenience to her. She all but rolled her eyes when I asked if we could order two sides of white rice. All in all, the restaurant was wonderful except for mama-san's poor attitude. Maybe the owner will read this an give her a night or two off.,Thanks so much for the kind review -- it's fantastic to know you enjoyed some excellent food with us. That said, I'd like to personally apologize for falling short of your expectations in terms of service. Your disappointment is most definitely my disappointment, and I'm sorry for putting you in that position. I can only imagine how frustrated you must have been.

I'd like nothing more than to invite you back and show you the five-star experience you deserve that I know we're capable of. 

Hoping to welcome you back over,
Kathy, Manager"
"Amazed by the queue every night when we walked passed, especially on the Xmas day. The food portion is great and taste is just fabulous. Service excellent!,Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'm so glad you enjoyed a nice Christmas meal with us -- it sure was an honor to have you over! Make sure to keep us in mind the next time you're in the area.

All the best, and happy holidays,
Kathy, Manager"
"I try to visit House of Nanking whenever I'm in town for business.  It never fails to be a low-key, delicious way to spend some time prepping for the week!  We usually end up ordering too much and trying to eat it all.  Don't miss the hot & sour soup, the sesame chicken, and the salt and pepper shrimp.  Add in a couple of veggie and noodle dishes and you're all set.  This time we also had eggrolls and potstickers, both were excellent.,Thanks for making sure to pay us a visit -- it means a lot! Great recommendations, and I hope you'll be back for all of them soon. 

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"I am finally writing a review of House of Nanking.  I've been going to this restaurant for many years. It is always consistently good. This is my go to restaurant in Chinatown. Different people have their go to spot in Chinatown and this is mine. I have taken coworkers and family who were visiting in the bay to this restaurant.  Everyone has loved it. The owner is very nice and is sometimes there for lunch.  I like going for lunch instead of dinner.  Dinner can be extremely busy. Good choice in Chinatown.,Carmen, better late than never! Thank you for being such a loyal customer of ours, and for introducing us to the important people in your life -- what an honor! I appreciate your kind words, and look forward to seeing you again soon.

Come hungry,
Kathy, Manager"
"I love the House of Nan King. We have been coming for decades and each time we enjoy a fresh and quality meal. Usually, we just fell out server what we like and don't like (spicy, fish, chicken, beef, noodle, etc.) and then let them bring us dishes they recommend. We have never left hungry or unsatisfied.

The house chicken dish is amazing. Pot stickers steamed or fried in peanut sauce. All is amazing. 
Enjoy. The house special rice is delicious.,House of Nanking loves you! Thank you for being such loyal customers of ours over the years -- nothing could make me happier! Here's to decades more of great food and memories.

Best regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"House of Nanking has this hustle and bustle of energy to it that the guests contribute to it just as much as the staff. It's very good, with a variety of veggies and meat options cooked in a flavorful explosion of flavors from pepper to basil to peanuts. Definitely make a stop and enjoy on your visit to San Francisco.,Thanks for appreciating what we're all about, Shemeka -- it's a joy to know you and your taste buds enjoy enjoy us so much! I look forward to seeing you again soon.

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Been coming here for decades. Any visit to S.F always includes a meal at Nanking & Henry's Hunan. Part of the charm of both are dining in a cramped space (like in Hong Kong), elbow-to-elbow with suits/blue-collars/Drs/lawyers/government-types/students/laborers - everybody shares a common bond here ... They all enjoy serious, authentic Chinese food ... Nothing fancy, no pretension, just great Chinese chow - in a dump that is charming because it is so nondescript. Net/net: come, eat, enjoy - expect that, nothing more.,Thank you for being such long-term fans -- it means a lot to know we're always included in your visits to town. It's truly wonderful that you get what we're all about, so thanks for reaching out with this review of yours. Hope to see you again soon!

Happy holidays,
Kathy, Manager"
"The first time I went here, 6 or 7 years ago, it was great. This time. Disgusting. DISGUSTING.!

Toilets, right by kitchen, the kitchen staff use them and now are VERY dirty….and stink.!

Food. I ordered ‘Melt In Your Mouth Calamari” I have had melt in your mouth calamari at decent restaurants but the foul muck they served was like a bowl of tasteless extra chewy rubber bands. Foul. Low quality ingredients and not even in circles, they were in these 1 inch chopped up strands, covered in a super cheap batter and swimming in some wet tasteless milk. $15.00.! This Calamari would only melt in a fire.!

The pork dumplings. Disgusting and tasteless with gristle in. Say no more.! Foul, cheap muck.!

The floor of the restaurant. They cannot even be bothered to clean it. I felt this place was taking the mickey out of paying customers or more likely tourists. Filthy.! See pics. The chairs felt dirty and some held together with gaffer tape. See Pic. There is a filthy curtain draping the door, to stop breezes I guessed (?) that everyone leaving or coming in is forced to touch and rub against. See Pic. Did I mention the stink in the toilet and the filth already.? See pics

I asked for a tea, they did not ask what type and instead brought me an old pint glass with some dirty looking plant in it and tried to charge me $4. 

I would expect to have paid about $6 for my meal and had I stayed to eat it all they would have charged me $30+……what a joke.! I could hardly wait to get this review online and save some other poor souls or tourists from getting ripped off.!

Summary. Do not go in this place. If you do, man up and send your food back if it’s like I described or go find somewhere decent and cheap because there are thousands of options, great options close by. You have been warned.! Anyone on here telling oyu the food is great does not have my standards. I am realistic and was not expecting Michelin star food but the gank I was served here should fall short of everyone's basic standard and to try and get $30 out of me for it...? HA.!,Cimmy, I'm so sorry for disappointing you. The description of your experience with us is most definitely not what I'd ever want for you -- please know that I'll be discussing your comments with the entire team. You deserve to enjoy wonderful food, drinks, and service with us, not to mention in a hygienic, pleasant environment, so it's disheartening to know your visit was so different. I'll certainly be looking into this shortly. Thank you for reaching out.

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"After wandering around aimlessly getting more and more lost we stumbled upon House of Nanking. We were lucky enough to get a table straight away. I liked how the place was very unpretentious, it really allowed the food to speak for itself.

We were hungry so ordered a  few pieces from the menu. We didnt know the portions were so big, so there was way too much for the two of us. The food was so good though, so i cracked on and battled away as much as i could. The sesame chicken was (as the kids say) boss!! 10 out of 10.

Its a shame we live a few thousand miles away, otherwise i could see this being a regular place for us. Great food at a great great price. Dont think about going, just go!,Danny, it really is a shame that you live a few thousand miles away -- we'd love to see you all the time! Certainly, no one will leave our restaurant still hungry and I'm glad you pushed on to enjoy as much of that sesame chicken as possible. Thank you so much for this wonderful review and I do hope it won't be long until we see you again.

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"I have been here several times over the years. I enjoy coming in and asking for dishes with different meats and then watching to see what comes out. It never disappoints.,Always an absolute pleasure to have you, Wayne! I'm happy to hear we can consistently deliver for you on all fronts -- you should expect nothing less. Thank you for the fantastic review and we look forward to having you back again real soon!

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"I really dislike giving anyone a bad review. but the food has gone DOWN HILL.
i had sesame chicken. it was like eating petrified wood. it must have been left over & reheated. I have eaten here over the years and found this place after living in San Francisco . The place is jam packed, i felt like i was sitting on the next person's lap, it was Hot inside, and then to get terrible food.The entire experience was a bad time & waste of money.,Vita, I'm really concerned to hear you didn't have a better experience with us, especially after you've eaten with us a few times over the years. Everything should be fresh and flavorful, so I'm disappointed to hear you didn't feel that was the case this time around. I know we're capable of better, so I hope we get a chance to make it up to you. 

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Have to say upon entering we were a bit hesitant as this restaurant is not exactly upscale. However don't be fooled! The potstickers were perfection. We had a beef dish and sesame chicken, and their house fried rice-delicious. Even the tea was special-served piping hot with a jasmine flower floating and adding flavor. A must for anyone wanting authentic Chinese.,Thank you so much for not only giving us a try but for taking the time to leave us wonderful feedback as well. I'm thrilled you enjoyed the meal! If you're in the area again, we'd love to have you stop in for another visit.

Best wishes,
Kathy, Manager"
"How sad I was on Sunday November 29 that the quality and taste of the food at House of Nanking was so disappointing.  I used to look forward to coming to SFO in part because of the best Chinese food I had ever had in 2003, and over the years it has still been good, but not anymore....sad.,While it's great to hear from a longtime patron, I'm very disappointed you've been unimpressed with the food recently. We're still making everything in-house from fresh, high-quality ingredients, so I'm sure how we fell short. Thank you for the feedback, though, and I'll be sure to look into it. If you're in the area again, we'd love another opportunity to show you our best.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"We just happened by and got right in. Sesame chicken and steamed dumplings were awesome. Can't wait to come back to SFO and try more items! Serious food envy from other plates around us!,Jamie, so glad you could get right to your meal! Hope you'll make it back before too long, because it sounds like your first visit was a real hit. Don't hesitate to ask for recommendations! -Kathy, Manager"
"This is the place I was told about upon arrival in SF. Nothing if it is not neat, clean, fast and efficient. The hostess / server maybe missed a couple of days in charm school, but so what - many of us have. 
Don't overthink the menu - just have her tell you what to eat (not kidding) and go with the flow. The calamari I had was stupendous and a more than sufficient, sided with steamed rice that I was told I wanted. 
If you make it clear what you want, you'll be accommodated. No question in my mind judging by all the happy campers. 
The Chinese beer was served at just above 40-42 degrees: perfect for that lager. Before you know it, the bill will be in front of you and you're in the wind, you'll be told you're done eating (not overtly). 
Certainly a keeper. Not to be missed in spite of negative reviews from those entitled travelers among us.,Thank you so much for the wonderful review -- I absolutely love knowing you enjoy the true House of Nanking experience. It's fantastic flavors we focus on the most, so nothing beats reading just how much you appreciate that about us. I certainly hope I'll be welcoming you back for more of all your favorite dishes with us sooner than later!

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Ate lunch here on a recommendation from a friend. The restaurant is very unassuming from the outside, but the food is great. The pork dumplings were delicious, and the wonton soup was the best I've ever had. This is a must stop if you're in Chinatown!,Lianna, thanks for taking that recommendation, and coming to visit us for a great meal! I appreciate your recommendation, and sure hope I'll be welcoming you back over for more of those pork dumplings you were blown away by!

Kindest regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Don't go here to look at the menu. Tell your server to surprise you. Specify the meat you want and they'll take it from there. Some of the best dishes we have had here weren't on the menu.,Thank you for getting what we're all about! It's fantastic to know you've enjoyed our food so much, whether it's on or off the menu. Plenty more where that all came from, right here!

Hoping to welcome you back soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"We liked the food but once we paid ,the waitress that return our change was very aggressive and demanded a tip and even wrote the amount on the ticket.,While I'm glad you enjoyed your meal with us, I'm sorry about your service experience toward the end of your visit. You should never have to deal with anything other than professional, respectful treatment from any of us, so I'd like to take the opportunity to apologize on behalf of the restaurant for dropping the ball. 

I'd love nothing more than to show you how much better we can do than this, so I sure hope you may consider giving us another shot one day.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"Having eaten here a number of times I have yet to be even slightly disappointed with the experience.
Getting to know people while queueing, sitting at mixed tables, the extremely quick service and excellent quality of food all add to the ambience of this cheap but cheerful restaurant.
You have to try the fired onion cake as an appetizer, and of course the signature sesame chicken and sweet potato.
Portions are huge, so go hungry or bring a hungry friend!,Thank you for being a loyal customer of ours, Paedar -- I love knowing you enjoy your entire experience with us so much, every time you visit. I appreciate your wonderful recommendations, and hope to see you again soon. We sure aren't going anywhere anytime soon!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"We knew we were in the right place when our bus driver - a local - called this his favorite in Chinatown. What to know: it's more of a diner. Rather small, very informal and a little cramped but just fine. I suggest you go for a table in the back to stay out of the traffic flow.

They offer only one beer: Tsingtao, a Chinese beer, but it's very accessible to American tastes, and they serve it cold. While they offer only Salmon Creek wines, they have several varietals, in both red and white, and Salmon Creek makes very solid table wines, in my opinion. (It's the same company responsible for Charles Shaw - Two Buck Chuck - wines at Trader Joes, only better!)

The food is good, portions are generous. Party of 4? Try sharing 3 dishes. It will be plenty, and sharing is encouraged.,Thank you so much for giving us a chance -- I'm so glad you enjoyed what we have to offer in terms of food and drinks, and I sure can't wait to invite you back over for more.

Take care, and all the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"exquisite food, superbly cooked in an understated but clearly popular restaurant in the heart of SF's Chinatown. Simple decor can't detract from a culinary experience you'll remember.
Try the sesame chicken with sweet potatoes; the cold noodle dish was also excellent. wine by the glass is reasonably priced. Very busy on Friday and Saturday. Ring ahead and book,Frazer, thank you so much for the amazing review -- it sure was a joy to read. I'm honored to know just how much you enjoyed your meal with us, especially our Sesame Chicken and noodles, and I hope to see you again one day for more!

You're always invited back,
Kathy, Manager"
"It's a real hole in the wall in Chinatown. We went off-peak so no wait. Great food. Limited menu. The staff give you no time to read the menu so read it online before you go. Another review stated rude staff, very true, but we assumed it was cultural so viewed it as part of the experience. Tons of food so get a different dish each. Most tables are long sharing tables.,Thank you for your open-mindedness, and your kind words -- it was a pleasure to have you over for a true House of Nanking experience, and I sure hope I'll be getting the chance to welcome you back for more of your favorite dishes.

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Friendly chinese restaurant with great food options, for meat and vegetables lovers.  Not a cozy restaurant, not great wine but an experience that is absolutely worth it on a San Francisco trip.,Thank you so much for considering us well worth the trip, Martine -- I love, love, love knowing you enjoyed your overall experience with us so much, and can't wait to welcome you back!

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"Do not look for 5 star service or comfort.
Keep away from the deep fried sweet stuff.  I loved the garlic fish with pepper and spinach.,Terry, I'm glad you know exactly what you like, and found it here with our garlic fish! Plenty more where that came from.

Thanks for writing to us,
Kathy, Manager"
"Good enough Chinese food, though I can think of many places much less famous that are better. Sesame chicken was over cooked and very heavily breaded with not a ton of meat but the flavor was quite good.,Sorry we fell short of your expectations -- our signature Nanking Sesame Chicken is a number one crowd-pleaser, so it's definitely concerning to read you just weren't too impressed. I sure hope you may consider giving us a second shot one day, because I know we have what it takes to blow you away.

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Lines can be long and the wine list is poor for California, but the food was good and the atmosphere embued with local flavor. My companions had visited many times and recommended we opt for a family style meal.  The waiter checked for dietary restrictions; then just brought us dish after dish. All was good and the bill for 4 with drinks was 89.00!  Good deal, but not fancy.,Thanks for writing us -- it was great to have you here! Hope to invite you back over sooner than later.

"Was in Chinatown and wanted some good Chinese food.   We asked the cab driver and he recommended House of Nanking.    We walked past several restaurants and waited in line to get in.   It was worth it.   Best Chinese food I have ever had.   Hot and Sour soup was great.  Steamed pork dumplings wee outstanding.    Waiter recommended a shrimp dish that was amazing.    Apples and shrimp in a creamy sauce.    Comments I heard from other patrons echo'd our experience. I highly recommend this restaurant when in Chinatown.,I'm glad your cab driver recommended us, and that you ended up considering us well worth the wait! There really is no compliment that compares to being told we were responsible for some of the best Chinese food you've ever had, so thank you so much for writing to us. 

I very much appreciate your recommendation, and hope to welcome you back sooner than later for more of all your favorite dishes!

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Had to wait a short while for a table though it was worth the wait. The place is a no frills establishment but the food is good and of generous portions.,Glad we were worth the wait, Alan -- I can't wait to welcome you back for more of that food you enjoyed so much!

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"We shared a soup and the five spice pork chops. The soup was excellent, and the wontons had good flavour. The pork chops could have had a little more spice for my taste, but was very good. The service was excellent, food came pretty quickly and we got a table straight away. Would recommend.,Patrick, thank you so much for stopping by and enjoying your meal so much -- your feedback is incredibly valuable, and I hope to one day blow you away and show you the complete five-star experience I know we're capable of giving you!

"With SO many Chinese restaurants clamoring for your attention in the Chinatown district, it is easy to become overhwhelmed. You want an authentic experience, you don't want to get stuck in a tourist trap, and you definitely don't want to be price gouged. 

The House of Nanking was EXACTLY what I was hoping for and highly recommend it to travelers new to San Francisco who want to get value for their buck without sacrificing atmosphere. It's SMALL, and you'll need to be comfortable with sharing table space with strangers (I, for one, love this as it forces conversation). The open windows are a wonderful touch, and although the decor is minimal this works to its advantage-- it doesn't feel like an over-decorated tourist trap, but rather a tasteful, modest, authentic restaurant.

And the food is a home run. I had the pepper shrimp and it was UNBELIEVABLE. The do NOT accept reservations, so plan on waiting in line for quite some time. My recommendation is to dine early: If you arrive aroudn 5:30, you'll beat the crowd and have the satisfaction of looking out at the queue stretching around the block while you enjoy some of the best chinese food around.,Carley, thanks for a brilliant review -- it's customers like you who make us love what we do even more than we already do. Thank you so much for your appreciation, as well as sharing our passion. I can't wait to welcome you back for more of that Pepper Shrimp you enjoyed so much!

Best regards,

"Love this restaurant. 
I go every time I'm in San Francisco. 
The service is great and it's always packed. 
You'll get a good value meal and sometimes there's some impromptu  entertainment thrown in, in terms of the banter between the service and kitchen staff. 

Always, always order the sesame chicken!,This restaurant loves you right back, John -- thanks for being a fan! Nothing beats knowing we're a must-visit each time you're in town. 

I can't wait to have you back over for more of our signature Sesame Chicken you adore so much!

"As the biggest China Town outside of China we struggled to pick a Chinese restaurant out of the hundreds. We asked a taxi driver who then recommended this place and we were not disappointed. We had gone past it the day before around 8pm and saw queues outside the door so decided on an early dinner when we did go to avoid this, which we did (around 7pm). As soon as we walked in we were greeted and given a nice window seat. The staff were attentive and friendly and the food was really reasonable - our cheapest dinner during the whole trip in fact. As for the food, it was excellent - really tasty and loads of it! We could see people asking for doggy bags the portions were so big. A great little place serving really good food at reasonable prices. It isn't fine dining but we weren't looking for that. Save your time deciding on the mass of Chinese restaurants San Fran has and head straight here! If you do go when it's busy, it's worth the wait.,Natalie, I'm glad we were recommended to you, and that you ended up enjoying a tasty, complete value-for-money experience with us -- that's all I could ever want for you. Thanks for the recommendation, and I hope to see you again one day.

"We went to this restaurant because of the reviews on TA, and it didn't disappoint.   It was very small and when we go there people were queuing outside for a table which is always a good sign.  We didn't have a long wait and ended up sitting with the people who we had been queuing up with.  If you want a romantic evening don't  go here but if its a great crazy atmosphere with amazing food then do.   Its also reasonably priced for San Francisco.,Thanks for giving us a shot, guys -- I'm so glad you enjoyed some awesome food with us, and I very much look forward to welcoming you back one day.

"We decided to eat dinner at House of Nanking on the recommendation of our hotel concierge. He noted that we would have awesome service. Mentioning that we wouldn't receive a menu but receive suggestions after asking a gamut of questions to discern our taste. That didn't happen, we waited in line and got in rather quick. That was based on the number in your party nothing super official. We were sat and handed menus and then our waiter disappeared. It was s full house, with s line to get in. We ordered onion cake, house noodles, braised green beans and shrimp and mushrooms. The food was meh. The onion cake is literally some flaky pastry and then stuffed with a variety of loose onions, topped with a very sweet peanut sauce. It wasn't good, well prepared or even a great concept ""fusion"" dish. The green beans were amazing!!! The best thing we ate there. The delivery of food was at an inconsistent pace, with the shrimp entree trailing far behind. We were full by the time it made it. 

I think I went in with high expectations and was left with mediocre performance.,Firstly, thank you for reaching out about your experience. It's definitely disappointing to know you just weren't impressed with the dishes you ordered (with the exception of those green beans!). I sincerely hope you may consider returning one day and giving us another shot to blow you away, because I know we have what it takes. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"The food was average. Some dishes were fantastic and flavorful: dry braised green beans, shrimp and mushroom (so fresh). Other items were confusing, the onion pancake with its sweet peanut sauce.  Service was good enough, and the atmosphere relies on the food being good.,While I'm glad to know there were some definite highlights to your meal with us, I sure wish you felt you'd enjoyed a consistently awesome experience. I'd like nothing more than to welcome you back so that you can try some of our other signature items -- I know they'll blow you away!

"I headed here after reading the reviews on trip advisor. This place has good service and is quite cheap. There's not a huge option of food and after reading the review on the sesame chicken I ordered it expecting it to be the ""great"" it unfortunately wasn't.. it was ok but maybe the next time I try Chinese food in San Francisco I'll try one of the plenty of other restaurants in China town.,Dean, I'm sorry that the sesame chicken let you down. I'll definitely mention this to the team, so we can work on making things better. 

It's great to know the service was a hit, though. I hope you'll stop in again to give us another shot! 

Take care, 
Kathy, Manager"
"sesame chicken was great. the fried egg plant that cam with it and apple was amazing. salt and peeper shrimp and mushroom and a couple of cold beers and we were happy and full at lunch. we arrived as they were opening at 11 am so everything was fresh and service was great!,Thanks for joining us for lunch! It's awesome to hear, in detail, how great your meal was, and we can't wait to have you back! 

Many thanks, 
Kathy, Manager"
"We visited this restaurant for lunch and were served very promptly. Surroundings were a bit scruffy. My husband noticed a pile of stacked boxes which were being used as a table, the bottom box looked like it had not been moved for years. The drinks glasses were badly scratched. The food was fine, but not outstanding. The washroom facilities didn't look too great either.
Would I recommend? No, not really.,It sounds like your experience would've been a little better had things looked cleaner in our dining room. We do our best to keep things clean and up to date, but I appreciate the feedback all the same. Thank you! 

All the best,

"Great food in chinatown at very reasonable prices.  The pork wonton for starters were great.  For mains, we had the melt-in-your-mouth calamari and the house noodles with beef.  The calamari were definitely good, but the house noodles were the star of the meal.,Thanks for reaching out -- you did a great job ordering, and I sure hope I'll be getting the chance to welcome you back sometime soon for more of those house noodles you enjoy so much!

"We went here after reading the reviews on trip advisor. The place was packed on a Sunday night but we were seated in 5min. We found out later this is due to their very fast turnaround rate.

If you like quick courteous service and decent food this is a good choice. I found the menu to be somewhat limited and the food to be average.,I'm so glad you gave us a shot -- but I sure wish we'd impressed you more. We take pride in the quality and variety of the dishes we serve you, and I hope you may consider giving us another shot to blow you away. I know we can do it!

"My husband and I were looking for a chines restaurant so we asked a cab driver for a recommendation. He told us this was the place and we were not disappointed. The next time we were here, I was entertaining clients. i asked them to pick the place and they picked this, telling me that it was the best Chinese restaurant in town - same as the cab driver. They basically just pick the food for you and everything is amazing. It is fast paced so if you're looking for a relaxing and quiet dinner this is not the place.,I'm so glad we were recommended to you -- it was a pleasure to have you dine with us! Thank you so much for reaching out, and I sure hope we'll be getting the chance to welcome you back over one day.

"My husband and I were incredibly keen to try some Chinese food whilst visiting San Francisco. We noticed this place had awesome reviews however the service reviewed poorly... All I can say is woah! The food was incredible! We had the sesame chicken and fried calamari which just melted in your mouth. The beer was awesome too! As far as the service goes, I certainly wouldn't say they were rude, they were quick to get you a table, quick to get your order and serve your food and drinks. Sure there was no banter between staff and guests but that didn't bother us at all, we were too busy stuffing our faces! Would definitely go back and highly recommend trying it out :),Ashlee, thank you for enjoying our food so much -- that's all we could ask for! 

Hope to see you again one day,
Kathy, Manager"
"In 2012 My family and me had a trip all over the US, and now, when I look back at the trip we had - I can say that this restaurant is the most memorable of all restaurants we were (including restaurants from Vegas, New York, Los Angels, etc...)
The fact that I still remember the restaurant's name is a proof.

It started with the nice service, where the manager was polite and helped us choose our dishes. He asked some guide questions to know what we like and dislike - and told us to trust him. We didn't know what he will give us to eat but he was just right! Every dish was delicious and at the right size.

The atmosphere was just great too. 

I don't know how the restaurant is in these days but one thing is for sure - I will be back.

Next time you come - just ask the staff to choose the food for you.

Thank you for the great experience!,Wow -- thank you so much for remembering us! I sure hope we'll be getting the chance to welcome you back over for  another memorable meal.

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"We ate here on our last night in San Francisco. We had decided to eat at an Asian restaurant since we hadn't yet even though we were staying close to Chinatown. We decided on this place based on advice from Anthony Bordain..if you see locals lined up for a restaurant..that's where you should go.  We saw locals lined up here every night.  

Luckily we didn't have to wait on the night we were there, although it was very busy. We weren't looking for a big dinner so we only ordered the fried Calamari and rice.  If it was any indication of the rest of the food, I'd like to give it a try again when we were hungrier.  All of the food being served around us looked delicious.  The calamari was fried in a light tempura batter and served in a light butter and lemon sauce.,Thanks for stopping by on that last night, Mary! I very much look forward to welcoming you back for another tasty meal when you're hungrier -- we've got a lot to offer you!

Hope to see you soon,

"Every time we are in S.F. we come here--just go in and say ""we're hungry, bring food"".  Never disappointed!

And here's an update, Oct. 2015--Still Never Disappointed.  I've been back numerous times since my review in 2010.  The unfavorable reviews are right in that there's not much in the way of decor, and it's crowded, and the service is not fawning.  But everyone is friendly, I think it's great to sit close to other patrons and have struck up fun conversations with strangers enjoying their food.  So don't go to be impressed by ambience or jacket and bow tie service, just sit back and ask them to bring you good food--and they will!  Fast!,Thank you, thank you, thank you! It's always a complete pleasure to welcome you over, and nothing is ever more refreshing than knowing you get what we're all about. Can't wait to see you again!

"Read the mixed reviews on TA before going and found them accurate.  I understand the whole deal about not caring so much about decor/ambiance if the food is great but that wasn't the case here.  Zero politeness during seating and ordering and actually thought plates were going to be broken when food came.  Would have been fine with all that if we'd gotten superior food but we did not.  We had spinach salad which was pretty tasty and enough to share and then a couple of scallop dishes.  They were both pretty well prepared but very light on portion sizes.  All this for about $50 so taken all in all not very good value at all.  Not going back.,I'm sorry we failed to impress you. The truth is that scallops are most definitely not cheap, and we ensure quality of our ingredients at all costs -- you mentioned getting a couple of scallop dishes, which is why your bill amounted to what it did. We offer a wide selection of different dishes, and hope you may consider returning to try a few one day. I'd love to welcome you over!

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"quite rude manners but we enjoyed the food, we had pan fried noodle with grilled dumplings. But we had plenty of choice in sides, meat and seafood dishes too. To try if you stay in Chinatown. Cheap prices.,Simona, I'm sorry you weren't too impressed with our service, but it's great to know you enjoyed some great food with us -- that's what we focus on making sure happens around here.

"The host at our B&B recommended this place to us after saying it was the best in Chinatown.  We ordered the potstickers to start with.   They were fried and overdone.  The peanut sauce wasn't anything special.  We also ordered their ""specialty"" sesame chicken.  First off, it was fried to a frazzle.  Secondly, our sesame chicken at our local Mall in Michigan, could beat it hands down!  Believe me, it was nothing special.  The rice was cold, dry, and stuck together in a clump.  Yes, the price was right, but what does that matter when the food is lacking?,I'm sincerely sorry you felt your meal was lacking -- you should only ever enjoy five-star dishes with us. I'll be looking into this immediately, and sure hope you may consider giving us another shot one day, because I assure you we can do a lot better than this.

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"We have literally just come home from this place. It looks terrible from the outside and not much better inside but the food is some of the best Chinese food i have ever had. 

Started off with a women shouting at as across the room, and we were plunked at the end of a table where others were still dining. As it turned out they were from Denver and always ate in the place when passing through. They recommended several dishes for us and we picked a few other. Food came in 5 to 10 mins (starters and mains together). It was simple and delicious! Top restaurant and excellent prices. Dont bother getting dressed up though.

P.s try the sesame chicken and shredded beef (which isnt on the menu).,Jane, I'm glad to be responsible for some of the best Chinese food you've ever had! Thank you so much for being a fan, and for your awesome recommendations -- I really appreciate it.

Hoping to welcome you back sooner than later,
Kathy, Manager"
"Food is of the highest quality. I haven't tasted a Chinese like it. When you see them bringing all the dishes out they all look equally good.

However, staff are fairly rude. We were asked if we were ready to order and before we could answer the waitress walked off. Everything seemed like a hassle or annoyance for them.

Even in spite of that 4* due to the amazing food!,Thank you so much for being a fan -- it's seriously awesome to know you haven't tasted anything quite like our food! Sorry you weren't impressed by our service, but I sure hope you may consider returning sometime soon if just for those dishes you love so much.

"In all our years of dining out I've never come across worse service than in this place. The couple next to us tried to order another (main) course, however, because the chef left at 9pm, and it was 9.02 they were told to eat up! Their bill was delivered within another couple of minutes. Our starters and mains arrived together and there was absolutely no interaction with the staff until they expected their usual tip!! We were so disappointed in the entire experience and certainly won't be back to this restaurant when we re-visit SF.,Graham, I'm disappointed to know we fell short of your expectations. I'm sincerely sorry if we showed you a service experience you weren't exactly accustomed to, but it is never our intention to leave you with this sort of impression. I certainly hope you may consider giving us another shot -- I know we can do a lot better.

"We went here on a Sunday evening with two persons and had the luck to be seated right away. When we left, there was already a huge line of people waiting outside. The place is loud, crowded and has some kind of vibrant busyness, that I really like. It's certainly not the place to have a romantic date or a business dinner. It's the right place for excellent chinese food. Not more and no less. The food is fresh, well cooked and extremely well seasoned. Don't expect the service to be overly friendly the american way, you simply place your order, you get your food, you get the check, you pay and leave. There is not much time for unnecessary small talk. We had a great experience and would certainly visit this restaurant again.,Thanks for your visit, Thorsten -- I'm glad you skipped the wait, and enjoyed our ambiance so much. Knowing you loved your meals with us so much is awesome, and I can't wait to welcome you back for more,

See you soon,

"We were told it was rude....and it was! Absolutely NO polite chat between waitress and guest...in fact we were almost told off for taking so long with the menu! The food was almost thrown at us...and came in no specific order, just when it was ready! Dont expect glasses for your drinks - bottles and cans are fine vessels for liquid!. Food was deliciously tasty. Not the place for a quiet chat as was very noisey. Great experience. Definitely go again when Im back in SF.,Mandy, thank you for being a fan! I understand if the service experience we provided you may have been a little different from what you're used to, but I'm glad to read that the dishes you enjoyed made up for it!

"This was a recommendation from a friend of mine.
It was a walk from downtown and if you are not sure of what you want they have a family style lunch that is some of the best Chinese Food I have ever had.
Fast service very friendly and the food was absolutely fresh and full of traditional flavors.
Every dish was delivered hot and spectacular the aroma was from the plates was letting you know what you were about to experience.
Be hungry because they provide a lot of food for the price.

"we look forward to eat here every time we have come to sf in the past 20 years
it has deteriorated
 sesame chicken was tasteless with minimal sauce, the sizzling rice soup did not sizzle and the onion cake was way to oily and fennel taste was in everything
same shtick crowded , haughty service which we accept and enjoy
the best part of the night was to see billly joel eating next to me
i think i will  visit fang the owner in his restaurant on howard,Sorry if you feel we've slipped over the years, Phil -- you deserve to enjoy consistently wonderful food with us, no matter what, and it's disheartening to have disappointed you.

"The atmosphere at this establishment is chaotic, loud, and jammed packed with hustling waitstaff. The tables are filled so you will probably be placed with other parties but I don't mind that, new friends are interesting. A line forms outside but moves quickly as the waitstaff and kitchen work to keep people moving along at a fast pace. I found this ""dance"" to be rather entertaining to watch as menus fly, orders requested and food quickly brought out with the bill brought right after. The food was good, I would not call it the best I have eaten but good. The value was the entertainment which some people would not like but I loved. I think it is definitely worth the trip!,Thank you for your wonderful review -- what a pleasure it was to read! I'm so happy you enjoyed the entire experience with us so much, but I know we have what it takes to really blow your taste buds away, and I sure hope you'll be visiting again one day so we can prove that to you.

"We walked past this buzzing restaurant and thought wow it must be good to be this busy! So we walked in and were swept into a sea of faces and chatter. Once we had squeezed into one of the communal trestle tables we immediately got offered food by other diners and conversations started to flow. 

The food was tasty, plentiful and reasonably priced. The added bonus was trying everyone else's choices and making new friends!,Thomas, thank you for giving us a shot! From the food to the service, you deserve to enjoy an excellent experience with us each time you're over, and I'm pleased to know you loved each dish you tried so much.

"Been here three times now and they still amaze me with the great flavors of their kitchen. Part of the experience is an old mumbling lady that throws the menus at your table and between gibberish asks for your order. While the place looks dirty and worn out, there are a couple of waitresses that come and smile at you whenever the grunchy lady leaves your table.,Jorge, thanks for returning once more -- it's wonderful to know we're still blowing you away! Please do return sometime soon for more of your favorite dishes.

"Somewhat disappointed. Used to be the place we looked so forward to but the food seemed over cooked. Had pot stickers, stuffed mushrooms, Sesame Chicken. Best part was mushrooms.,Debbie, sorry that you feel we've slipped over the years -- I'd like to think we've been consistently serving up the dishes you know and love, so it's definitely disappointing to read your review. You deserve to enjoy delicious food each time you visit us, and there's really nothing I could want more than a second chance from you, to prove that we sure can do a lot better than this.

"OK, so this is one of the cities' over hyped places. It's like once a restaurant reaches a critical mass of hype, that alone is enough to sustain the hype unless the restaurant does something stupid.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good place. Lively, noisy and fun. We went there on a weekday dinner about 8 pm. We waited about 2 min and were seated. But right after that a queue began to form. The longest wait was probably about 20 min.

So, finally about the food: I have had much better Chinese food. We ordered the sizzling rice soup, Combo Chowmein and Mussels. The Chowmein was a 2/5, the Mussels 5/5 and the soup 3/5.
The Chowmein was a little too saucy for me. The Mussels dish looked awful but was the best tasting.

Service was nice.

Overall a good experience. But if you are going to be in the city for only a few days, give it a miss. Staying a little longer? Definitely worth a visit.,Thanks for reaching out -- it's great to know you gave us a shot, and enjoyed those mussels so much, not to mention our service. I sure hope you may consider returning one day so we can show you the five-star experience you deserve. 'Til then, take care!

Thank you again,
Kathy, Manager"
"I imagine San Francisco residents are embarrassed by this place. We sat down and they gave us forks! I looked around and in fact every table was set with forks. We had to ask for chopsticks. We should have known right then and there, especially when we noticed the menu seemed limited, but it had been recommended so we stuck it out.

The squid dish was delicious - lightly fried, tender, tasty. Everything else was so-so to bad. The pork dumplings, for example, weren't pan-fried but deep-fried, crunchy and tasteless. The beef wrap was kind of gross. The cold sesame noodles weren't actually noodles. The sesame chicken was unremarkable, which is about the best thing I can think to say about it. And the chili oil was literally just some dried chili flakes in a jar with oil poured over them. I was taken aback.

There are a lot of Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area; skip this one.,Thanks for reaching out. Our customers come from all over the globe, which is why we purposely provide you with forks. I'm so glad you enjoyed our calamari, but it's definitely disappointing to know you weren't impressed by the rest of the dishes you ordered. I know we have what it takes to impress you, and I sure hope you may consider returning one day to give us that second chance. You deserve a whole lot more than this.

Take care,

"This is not the place to go if you want a quiet, romantic dinner.  My partner and I were squeezed onto a table with two strangers who had already covered the table top with a variety of dishes.  However, we tried the fried pork potstickers and they were a nice entree but the main meal, the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken, was a real winner.  The tables are crammed in and set-up are more like a cafe/diner than a restaurant and the serving staff were doing a lot of shouting in Chinese to each other, as well as to the cooks, which added to the atmosphere.  We went fairly early (6.30pm) and got in straight away but it was full inside.  We watched the queue form and then lengthen outside the red painted front window as time passed.  The food and the beer were both very reasonably priced.  I'm glad we tried it as it was fun and I'd definitely go again but only if I was in the area."
"We have been visiting several times over the last years and love the place. Pretty authentic atmosphere and great food. Decor is pretty basic and the place gets very crowded. Not a lot of space between tables and you might be seated with other groups if you arrive late. With no reservation possible you might end up waiting outside if you arrive after 19.00. Waiters are nice but clearly wants to speed up things to create high rotation, but this is not a problem. Food is great - try the sesame chicken and the fried squid - awesome. Not the place if you want a quiet romantic dinner, but great affordable option otherwise.,Thanks for being loyal fans -- believe me when I say this place loves you right back! It's wonderful to know you enjoy us so much, and I look forward to welcoming you back for years to come.

"The House of Nanking was recommended to me by a family member as ""the best chinese food they have ever had."" While I would not say this about my experience, I will say that the House of Nanking provides delicious food in a fun atmosphere. We had five of us in our party, so we ordered several different dishes to try a little bit of everything and we found everything to be good. We particularly liked their Sesame Chicken, House Noodles, and Bok Choy salad. While I don't believe the atmosphere is intended to be fun, as many have noted on here the servers can be quite entertaining as they try to move people along. Many different people will serve your table throughout your meal and they have no formality when ordering: simply an ""Are you ready yet?"" We found this to be quite entertaining and a unique touch to our experience. Overall, I would definitely love to return for more!,Delicious food in a fun atmosphere? I'll take it! I'm so pleased to know you enjoyed everything you ordered, especially those three dishes. Thank you for appreciating what we're all about, and considering us unique -- it means the world.

Can't wait to see you again,
Kathy, Manager"
"Recommended to us by the doorman at The Orchard Hotel in SF. Full of character and we enjoyed fabulous food here. Tables are shared with other parties and the place is alive with noisy, happy chatter. Had to queue for around 20 mins for a table around 7pm...but that's a good sign for the delicious food to follow. Service was rapid. Was a bit conscious that the other diners on our table were a little rushed to leave once their meal was finished and were asked to take their drinks next door to finish off, but we didn't experience any feeling of being hurried out. Would definitely go back again and would encourage potential diners to give it a try - you won't be disappointed.,Nothing beats knowing we were recommended to you, and that you'd now recommend us! Thank you so very much for reaching out about your recent experience -- it was a complete joy to serve you. 

Hoping to see you again one day,
Kathy, Manager"
"ambiance is pretty authentic common Chinese
food was great - ordered more than I needed so I could take some for later,Dave, I'm glad you enjoyed your meal with us. Ordering too much can't ever be a bad thing, because like you said, all it means is leftovers for days! Enjoy!

"A friendly, efficient chinese restaurant - excellent for a simple lunch or to take a bunch of friends to. Food was tasty, service was good - they are used to tourists, but it doesn't feel like a tourist trap. A safe choice in Chinatown.,Thanks for writing to us, Axel -- what an all-around amazing review! All I want is for you to enjoy some great food and service with us, so it's wonderful to know that's exactly what happened. I look forward to inviting you back for more of your favorite dishes.

Best wishes,
Kathy, Manager"
"This place serves flavorful, slightly spicy, choices of Chinese food but different from the typical ones seen in dimsun restaurants. I would recommend the Wonton soup (milky soup with great flavor and a slight kick of spice). Try out other choices . . .,Thank you for a delightful description of us, Raphi -- not to mention the recommendation! I certainly hope I'll be welcoming you back over sometime soon for more of that Wonton Soup you enjoyed so much.

Warm regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"We noticed that the portions were very large and seemed to be meant to be shared. We ordered fried onion cakes as an appetizer but it really wasn't necessary. The prices were good. We had the sesame chicken in honey sauce and sweet potatoes and fried rice.,Shelly, thanks for that perfect rating of yours -- I'm so glad you enjoyed some tasty, plentiful dishes with us! I sure hope I'll be seeing you again soon.

"Several years ago I stopped in for the first time and saw Francis Ford Coppola eating at what used to be a counter. I didn't know the offices of his production company, Zeotrope, were directly across the street. Then I had the food, and understood why he was eating here. Everything they serve is worth trying. Tell them what you Ike. They actually let you know if you're over ordering.  I never visit San Francisco without having lunch here at least once. It's inexpensive. Beware of a wait if you come between 12 and 1. There's always a line. No reservations taken.,Norman, thank you for an awesome review. Knowing a trip to town is incomplete without visiting us is a compliment like no other -- thank you for reaching out. 

I look forward to your return!

"Got to this restaurant at about 19:00 to find a queue of 15 people or so outside. It took approx 30 mins to get in but was worth it

Location: Is not far off 'Grant Street' (main road through China town) so easy to get to

Food: Very tasty food but menu is a little limiting. Recommend the sesame chicken and green beans.

Atmosphere: The actual restaurant is quite small so the place gets packed very quickly. The tables are shared (unless you have a large party of people) but that adds to the lively atmosphere.

Staff: Other reviews mentioned the staff are rude but I found them to be professional and polite. The food arrived very quickly after ordering

Cost: Reasonably priced food, especially given the taste and quantities. Approx $50 for two,I'm glad you considered us worth the wait -- it's truly wonderful to know you enjoyed some great food and service with us, because that's all I want for you. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to let us know how much you enjoyed us, and I sure hope to welcome you back over one day!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were walking through Chinatown and asked a couple we saw holding food in a bag...left-overs.  If the food is good enough to take home we wanted to know the restaurant.  They told us house of Nanking.   Small place. Luckily not busy when we went there and it was great.  I can't remember what we ordered as its been awhile, but I do know we went back a few days later before returning home to eat there again.   Sorry we didn't buy a t'shirt for the kids.  Expect to sit at large table and possibly  share table with other people.,I sure am glad you asked that couple where they'd gotten their leftovers from! Knowing you dined with us twice during your holiday is a compliment like no other -- thank you, thank you, thank you!

Hoping to welcome you back sometime,
Kathy, Manager"
"First and foremost, the food here is great! Some of the best Chinese I've had. There is a good choice of meals and the menu is reasonably priced. 

However don't come here expecting to be treated well or even politely. We were forewarned of this behaviour prior to our visit but we did not expect the reviews we'd heard to be so accurate. 

There seems to always be queue for this restaurant (which is always a good sign of the quality of food), however because of this you are rushed from the moment you sit down to the moment you finish your last bite. 

Within about 2 minutes of sitting down we were asked what we'd like to order, and when we told the waiter we weren't ready he sighed obviously and turned away from us. The waiter was not particularly helpful with our questions on the menu either (basic things like ""does this come with rice?""). Upon finishing our meals, we had no sooner put down our chop sticks before the bill was shoved in front of us.

The emphasis here is clearly to get as many customers in and out the heavily crowded restaurant as fast as possible.

With that said, the food is worth the poor treatment and with only a change in the waiters' attitudes this could be a great restaurant.,Thank you for your appreciation of our food -- it's wonderful to know we're responsible for some of the best Chinese you've ever had! 

That said, as you can tell, we're a very busy establishment, and our priority is serving each and every one of you. This doesn't, however, mean that you should have to deal with anything but professional, efficient service, and I'd like to take the opportunity to apologize for the way you were treated by your server. 

All I can hope for is another chance from you -- I assure you that we can do a lot better.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"Our first time in SF and we were looking for something local, not to commercialised. Our hotel recommended Nanking! We were not disappointed. Food was superb. We ordered too much and our waiter kindly told us this and dropped something from the order. We usually walk out from a Chinese feeling stuffed and uncomfortable but not here. Loved the atmosphere, loved the busy atmosphere and best testimonial is the queue outside. A must for everyone. Thank you Nanking !,I'm so glad you visited us, Denise, especially on your first trip to town! It's truly spectacular to read how much you enjoyed our ambiance -- all I want is for you to enjoy some great Chinese fusion food in that enjoyable atmosphere you described! 

Hope to welcome you back one day,
Kathy, Manager"
"We had to wait 10 - 15 minutes to get a table, and ended up at a community table with 2 other pairs. It was worth it. The food is very well prepared, very tasty, and very plentiful. The calimari was fabulous: simple with just a sprinkling of vinegar(!) to add sparkle. The eggplant also was great. On Kearny near Columbus. Go!,I'm glad your love of our food made up for those seating arrangements -- thank you so very much for reaching out. It was a complete pleasure to have you dine with us, and I very much hope I'll be getting the chance to welcome you back one day.

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were hungry and had narrowed our Chinatown choices to 3 places, and picked this one. My dad was ready to walk out because the menu seemed more limited than the so-called vegetarian place down the street. But we stuck it out and were glad we did. Excellent SF value: tasty food, large portions and plates to share. We ordered 4 dishes for 3 people + rice which has to be ordered separately,  and almost had a little left over. My 16 year old who is a picky eater had sesame chicken w/ honey sauce and pronounced it very good; my Dad ordered pork egg rolls with almost nothing but pork--not your usual bean sprouts as filler. Good but almost too much meat he said. He also ordered a fried onion cake - lots of green onions between 2 layers of  what seems to be fried batter topped by about 3-4 Tbsp. brown sauce-- so not smothered-- and both were tasty. While I opted for the veg option of what turned out to be rather spicy but delicious stir-fried green beans and red onion. Almost no sauce, but didn't matter because what little there was mixed well with the rice and shared chicken from my daughter's plate.
The two adults didn't order drinks but he gave us big glasses of tap water right before the meal came out. That turned out to be a thoughtful gesture on his part as we needed the water relatively quickly and certainly would have asked for it.
 
As for the surly waiter, I think he runs the joint as his picture was on the wall- apparently he had received an award for the restaurant. The staff seemed like family, or at least old friends as they were always yelling at each other. Reminded me a bit of some places with this rep back in Chicago, it's all part of the local color.,I sure am glad you and your family stuck it out, too -- you ordered a fantastic spread of dishes, and it's wonderful to know you enjoyed it all! Please, do, return one day, because there's plenty more where that came from!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Great neighborhood experience.  The food was yummy, the atmosphere lively and the tables close.  As you would expect from a neighborhood eatery.  Don't be put off by the quick, staccato of the waitstaff, they are quick because the food is quick and the vibe lively.,Thanks for taking the time to write to us -- it sure was a pleasure to have you over! It means especially much to know that you get what we're all about, and it only makes me want to invite you back even more! 

Kind regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were seated very quickly and the staff was super attentive. We ordered 5 dishes for 6 people and thought everything was superb. Two of the less-adventurous had the sesame chicken and the others shared excellent dumplings and a super-tasty salad, among other dishes. It was great from start to finish!,It's great to know you enjoyed each dish you were served -- thank you so much for stopping by, and please know you're invited back at any time, any day!

Best regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Fantastic food, lots of vegetarian choice. Staff great. Lovely atmosphere. A must. Also, fab to see china town.,I'm so glad you enjoyed some fantastic food with us -- that's all I could ask for! Thank you so much for your recommendation. I hope to welcome you back one day!

Warm regards,

"We really enjoyed our meal at House of Nanking! 
The waiter understood what kind of meal our kids prefered. 
Waiters attitude was ok, just hard working people. 
Food was delicious and had been served pretty fast!,Kirsten, I'm so glad you and your family enjoyed yourselves so much! It means especially much to me to know you appreciated our service -- all we want is to be as efficient as possible for you! 

I sure hope we get the chance to serve you again one day.

"I rarely write a review, however had to add my two cents.  We brought our our family and visiting guests to the House of Nanking after a recommendation from a friend and the reviews.  We waited in line for 45 minutes which we were prepared for.  When reviews indicate service was bad, they are not just bad.  The staff is very rude as if you are lucky to be sitting in their tiny crowded restaurant.  I am aware of the drought, but it seemed like you were asking them for a free meal when asking for water.  When we did get water, the server was holding four glasses with one hand ... one finger deep in each glass.  ""No ice,"" the waitress barked when my niece requested ice for her extremely hot tea.  There is a giant ice machine full of ice next to the bathroom.  The beer was room temperature.  The food was good... Shrimp packets were delicious but very few shrimp.  Sesame chicken was tasty, but the dishes were nothing out of this world.  As I returned from the restroom, I asked a lady by the desk for ""to go"" containers for our leftover rice which she gave me. I returned to the table to hear the waitress tell my husband they did not provide ""to go"" containers, just as I placed the containers down in front of my husband.  Bottom line is that their focus is in trying to get as many people in and out, not in providing an enjoyable tasty dining experience.,Hilda, I'm sorry if you didn't enjoy your experience with us as much as I would have liked you to. You're right in that we like to seat everyone, which proves to be quite the challenge on some days, but you should never have to deal with subpar service, and for that, I'd like to apologize. 

That said, I'm glad you enjoyed the dishes you ordered, and I certainly hope you might consider returning one day to try more of what our menu has to offer. I know we can do a lot better than this.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"Ate here 5+ years ago. We enjoyed in then. Returned this trip to a mediocre dining experience from food to service. They were very busy but we saw the waiter 3 times. He took our order, brought our beers, and dropped of the check. Food was dropped off at the table by other employees in passing. 
The salt and pepper shrimp w mushrooms  was very tasty. As well as the steamed dumplings. 
Egg rolls were over fried making them dry.  Hot and sour soup was greasy and so were the house noodle. 
This place is still around based on tourists and an outdated reputation.,It's definitely disheartening to know you feel we've slipped since your first visit five years ago, Allie -- I'd hope to offer you a consistently fantastic dining experience, no matter what, each time you come. 

As glad as I am to know there were some definite highlights to your meal, I sure wish you'd enjoyed it all, and I'd like to take the opportunity to personally apologize for falling short of your expectations. 

All I can hope for is another chance from you one day, so that you can try some of our other menu items, because I know we still have what it takes to blow you away.

Kindest regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Our tour guide recommended this place and we were so pleased. I read reviews about the service not being good here but we had a great experience. We were seated as soon as we walked in and because we were in a hurry we were able to order, eat and pay our check in less that 45 minutes. The place wasn't too packed though. Timing is everything. The sesame chicken was amazing! My wife had the fried eggplant, and tofu with broccoli which was very good. I definitely recommend this place.,Thanks for taking your tour guide's advice -- I'm so, so pleased that you had such a great experience with us! You're completely right about timing, and it's awesome to know everything worked out so well. I can't wait to welcome you back for more of all your favorite dishes -- they sure aren't going anywhere!

Enjoy the rest of your holiday,
Kathy, Manager"
"We had to wait about 45 min for our table, and were rushed to order our food, but the dishes we chose were all very tasty and good value. The portions are quite big and not as spicy as the names sometimes suggest, but the prices are reasonable and we enjoyed the visit.,Sorry about the wait, David -- I'm glad your food made up for it, though. It's always great to know that in the end, you enjoyed a complete value-for-money experience with us. I sure hope I may get the chance to welcome you back so you can try more of our menu!

Warmest regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant was recommended and the ratings were high. When we arrived, people were standing outside in line waiting for a table. We were seated pretty quickly. All good signs, right? Ugh. The service was not good (the food came as it was ready so we didn't all get entrees at the same time -- 4th entree came after we asked twice and everyone else was done eating.) And the place is not clean. And the food wasn't all that tasty.,Sorry if you just weren't impressed by us, Michele -- you deserved to have been. The truth is that we're a busy restaurant, and prioritize getting the dishes you order to you as quickly as possible, so that we can seat everyone. I'm sorry if they didn't come in an ideal order. That said, I'd like to apologize if you just weren't impressed by the taste, either. This is something I'm definitely not used to hearing, but it's disheartening to know you felt that way. I'd like nothing more than to show you that we can do a lot better than this, so I hope you may consider giving us a second chance. 

Warm regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"While the food was good and good value for San Francisco, there are too many negatives from our dining experience here. We were prepared for the wait to get a table but not for a 20 minute time difference between the first person being served and the last person getting their meal. There was barely an apology and to cap it all a tip of 21% was put on without my approval. It was also put on in such a way that I appeared to have little choice. To me the delay in service and lack of any engagement did not warrant any tip. For me this was not a good meal and I would not recommend.,I'd hope for you to enjoy a five-star experience with us on each visit, so I'd like to apologize for falling short of your expectations in terms of service. You probably noticed yourself that we're generally a very busy establishment, so naturally, we prioritize getting as many dishes out as quickly and efficiently as possible -- I'm very sorry if our timing just didn't impress you. I can only hope that you may consider giving us another shot one day so we can prove to you that we're a lot better than this. Thank you for reaching out.

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"This great Chinese is not fancy, yet every dish is amazing. From a great won ton soup to great chicken and shrimps dishes. 
The service is quick and prices are reasonable. 
We came with the children and all enjoyed.,Doron, I'm so happy you think every dish of ours as delicious. A complete value-for-money experience is all we ever hope to provide you with, so it's awesome to know that's what you feel you get. Can't wait to see you again!

"I wanted to eat dinner at a restaurant in Chinatown on my trip and picked this well-known place off Kearny Street.  After dining there, I wished I had went elsewhere.  The service is rather poor.  They sat me down at a dirty table, dropped off a menu, and a male server came by a couple minutes later to take my order.  I asked him if he could clean off my table first.  He left and a female server came by with a rag and cleaned it off for me.  She then became my server and I never saw the gentleman again.  Quite strange.  My new server had absolutely no idea what politeness meant.  She has no business working in the service industry.  Neither did the inhospitable gentleman that came by at first.

The tables were too close together, not the newest and sturdiest things around, and dirty.  The restroom, again, small and not as clean as I would have liked.  I've been to worse, but this place isn't winning any decor awards anytime soon.  Average at best.

I asked for some of the plum wine.  It was a little after 5PM on a Friday and I was told they were all out of it as well as my second choice, Cabernet Sauvignon.  The only red wine they had available was Merlot so I got a glass of that.  What kind of respectable restaurant runs out of most of their wine by 5PM on a Friday night?  

Surely the food would make up for their other shortcomings, right?  I started off with a bowl of Spicy Wor Dumpling Soup ($8.95).  I've never had this particular soup before.  It wasn't spicy as the name suggests.  It was good though, better than expected.  Then, I had the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken ($9.95).  Famous for what?  I didn't like it.  I've had better Chinese food from the frozen food aisle at the local grocery store.  This kind of upset me.  So much so I left and headed to the Tonga Room and ordered zombie after zombie as an attempt to lift me up from my then gloomy state.,It's disappointing to read of your experience with us -- I sure wish you'd enjoyed yourself more. I'd like to apologize if you were unimpressed with our service -- you deserve to receive efficient, professional treatment, in addition to five-star meals, so I'm sorry if this just wasn't the case. All I can hope for is another chance from you, to show you what we're capable of, going forward. I know we can do a lot better.

Take care,

"My wife and I went to this restaraunt this past Saturday night since it was recommended in our Frommer""s guide book and our hotel front desk staff. There was a line outside but it moved quickly.  We were seated at a table for two although we could have been seated at a larger table shared with other customers. This is not the place for a quiet romantic dinner. There were also larger groups and families at the restaurant that night. 
  The service was quick and effecient.  The true highlight of the evening was the flavorful food. Wife and shared hot and sour soup which was the best I've ever had. For dinner we shared the sesame chicken and a pouched scallop dish served with a large bowl of rice.Simply put the portions are large and the food was delicious!,Thanks for stopping by, Mike -- it was a pleasure to serve you and your wife! It's excellent to know you appreciated our service and food so much, so thank you for reaching out. I look forward to inviting you back for more of your favorite dishes!

Kathy, Manager"
"Just loved this restaurant. Great food - especially the honey and sesame chicken. Very good value for money. You will find yourself sitting next to other diners but we did not mind this in the least.,This restaurant loved you right back! I'm so glad you feel you enjoyed a complete value-for-money experience with us, and I look forward to inviting you back for more of our signature Sesame Chicken you enjoy so much.

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"Great food and a great atmosphere. The fresh and creative plates keep you coming back for more. We usually ask for the sesame chicken and then let the staff pick the rest. We have never been disappointed.,Tony, thank you for your appreciation! I could never tire of hearing from an amazing customer -- please come back soon for more of that signature Sesame Chicken you enjoy so much!

'Til then, take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"The food here is authentic and delicious. We asked for suggestions and everything was really good. We should have ordered more because the plates are normal sized and not super-sized like you'd find in an American Chinese restaurant. 

They have a unique atmosphere. There is a wait, you are rushed to order, eat and leave. It is small and crowded. All of this is surprisingly just fine.

Wonderful spot in Chinatown.,Beth, thank you for the kind words of support -- they mean a lot to me. Nothing beats knowing you enjoy our food and atmosphere so much, and I can't wait to invite you back for more of all your favorites. 

See you soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"Most important to know.  You will wait.  You will be rushed to order.  You will be rushed to eat and leave.  If you know this in advance, then the quality of the food is worth it.  We had a memorable experience in meeting our table mates (family style seating) and just our interactions with their staff which was friendly but happened at 100 miles an hour.   We loved the fried eggplant appetizer, the sesame chicken, the spicy green beans and a beef dish (served with pancakes but not Mu-Shu).  The pork dumpling, pork eggrolls and stacked noodle dishes were good but not great.    This is an experience but DO NOT go unless you are in the right frame of mind to wait and then be rushed like you've never been rushed before.,We really just want to be able to serve everyone waiting for a bite, Joyce -- it's awesome to know that you understand that. Thank you very much for reaching out with advice to our future customers, and I certainly hope I'll be welcoming you back to the restaurant again one day.

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"You´re spoiled for choice with Chinese meals in SF´s Chinatown, but if there´s one place you HAVE to try if House of Nanking. There could be a bit of a wait (we queued up for about 10 minutes for a table) but the wait is worth it.

Dish selection is for everyone, and the service is fast. The house noodles, sesame chicken and fired pork potstickers are something else.

From now on there´s no real visit to Chinatown if not grabbing a bite at House of Nanking.

It closes 9pm so get there early!,Thanks for that passionate recommendation straight off the bat, Chur -- you just made my day! I certainly hope I'll be getting the chance to welcome you back sooner than later.

Hope to see you soon!
Kathy, Manager"
"If you want true authentic Chinese food this is the spot! Great food, quick service and excellent house of nankin sesame chicken. Make sure to get there early there is always a line outside during dinner. You must go to this place to see what I'm talking about.,I appreciate the support, Kelly -- nothing beats knowing you enjoyed your meal with us so much. Thanks for the awesome advice, and I hope to see you again one day, if just for our signature Sesame Chicken!

Warmest regards,

"We wanted to have lunch in Chinatown, and House of Nanking did not disappoint.  The foot was delicious and the atmosphere was authentic.,Thanks for choosing us, Amy -- I'm pleased to read there were no disappointments with us! I very much appreciate your kind words, and hope to welcome you over from Alabama again one day!

"We went with a party of 5. We all love this restaurant. We had a short wait to get in at about 5:00 pm on a weeknight. The server gave us a menu, but when I went to ask questions, he said ""Just choose your meat and we will bring you something you will like."" We chose beef, shrimp, and chicken and we loved what was served to us.,I'm glad the wait wasn't too long, and that you let us do the ordering! Nothing beats knowing you enjoyed your entire meal so much, and I sure hope to welcome you back sooner than later.

"My daughter and I recently ate at House of Nanking and both had food that was not good.  My sesame chicken and vegetables were covered in a sauce that was overwhelming.  I wished I could have just washed the sauce off of everything.  My daughter ordered ice tea but they served her hot tea, instead.  They don't care if the orders are correct.  I paid $39 for a lunch for two and had to leave the food on our plates.  The restaurant cured me of ever wanting Chinese food again.,Nancy, it's disappointing to hear the food didn't quite live up to your expectations. We never want anything leaving our kitchen that isn't seasoned and cooked to perfection, and I'm sorry if that wasn't the case -- you must have caught us on an off night. I do hope you'll consider joining us again in the future so we can show you what a meal with us is truly like.

Kathy, Manager"
"We went to house of Nanking after a suggestion by an Uber driver. Big mistake!  Restaurant was crowded and very loud. Food was not good. Their signature dish is sesame chicken and I have had better at an all you can eat Chinese buffet. The service was also bad and our order came out wrong. When questioned about the order, the server was not helpful. I would not recommend this restaurant with so many other choices in San Francisco.,I'm very sorry you just weren't impressed by us, Mindy. You deserve to enjoy delicious dishes with us in a fast-paced, yet animated environment, and I'd like to sincerely apologize if this just wasn't the case. All I can hope for at this point is a second shot, so that I can show you what were capable of, going forward.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"I've had Chinese food from take out that tastes better. The service was horrible. Crowded, loud..... Not good. Sorry did not enjoy it. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody.,I'd like to personally apologize on behalf of the entire establishment for falling short of your expectations. The truth is that we're a very busy restaurant, and naturally, we serve big crowds on a daily basis. That should never, however, affect the quality of the dishes we serve you, and I'm sorry if you just weren't impressed with your food.

I hope you may consider returning one day to try some of our other menu items, because I'm positive we'll blow you away.

Best regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Food is good as others have said and quite reasonably priced. We tried the pork dumplings, sesame chicken and the Bao bing wrap which were more than enough for two people, all cooked and tasted good.  

The only downside is the service is a bit hit and miss as well as the setting the place is what I would call a bit ""rustic"" and old fashioned. The place could do with a bit of an update but maybe that's the look they are going for. 

Worth visiting if you want to spend some time in Chinatown like we did going through all the colorful shops.,It sounds like you knew exactly what to order, Spyros -- thank you for stopping by! It's true, we really do want to keep that rustic look up, simply because we want our ambiance to stay as traditional as possible. Thank you for your recommendation, and please know you're always invited back for more of your favorite dishes!

Hoping to see you again soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant has an amazing menu of regular and gluten free items. Everything we had was delicious. The sesame chicken was a real treat, and we enjoyed the scallops in eggplant and the stuffed mushrooms. This is a must go to eatery in San Francisco.,I'm so glad you enjoyed each dish you ordered, Keith! Thank you for your fantastic recommendation, and I hope to welcome you back one day -- hopefully sooner than later!

Warm regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"This place may not be for everyone -- no white linens, hustle and bustle and as crowded as a Parisian bistro.  This is my kind of the place as long as the food is good!

Made reservations for 5 people at 7.30 PM -- but I'm not sure how much that would have mattered.  Seems like one has to stand outside in the line for your table to open regardless.  Luckily we were fairly early .. and got a table within 5 minutes. 

Had a couple of Tsin Tao beers (there were everywhere) -- and started having them bring us food.  Did we order? Nope -- just staid bring some appetizers .. then later bring us some other food .. with just a bit of scallops .. 

The two apps were good.  One I never had before -- a scrambled egg and bean sprout thing wrapped in a dough (think beignet) and fried.  NOM!  The other was a good sample of a steamed dumping.  Good flavor -- nice little black vinegar sauce to go with it. Good start!

We then had the famous sesame chicken (well earned, delicious), some pork spareribs that reminded me a lot of the Buk Kuh Teh of Singapore.  We also had the aforementioned scallops (perfectly stir fried!) .. and finally some ""thing"" that reasonable chopped up meat in a meatball served with a perfectly cook Gai Lan (Chinese Cabbage of a sport).  We devoured everything!  

Price is good too!  

So -- if you don't mind a bustling crowded but delicious outing for non-standard Chinese (meaning not Hunan, Sichuan or Cantonese) this is a great place to try.,Thanks for being a fan -- there's nothing I love more than reading about your experience with us. It's customers like you who make what I do a complete joy, so thank you so much for reaching out! 

Hoping to welcome you back again soon,

"This was a recommendation from an Uber driver last year. We ran out of time to go. House of Nanking will be a regular stop every time we go to The City. Only complaint was not having the beverages we wanted that were on the menu. That really wasn't a big deal since I normally drink water when we go out anyway. Four of us ate, all of the variety of food was delicious.,Kurt, I sure am glad your Uber driver recommended us, and that you finally got the chance to stop by! Nothing beats knowing you had such a great time, that we'll now be a regular spot! Sorry about not getting those drinks to you -- this most definitely isn't the norm for us, and I know the next time you're here, we'll have 'em for you!

Hoping to welcome you back sooner than later,

"Went to this Chinese restaurant as it was highly recommended. 
Saturday night at around 7pm. We managed to get a table for two and ordered Wonton soups, Nanking chicken, mushroom beef, chow mein,rice and some beers.
The food was excellent and was served quickly.
The reason for only one star was that no sooner had we finished our food, that we were presented with the bill.
We were going to order sweets and more beers but were taken aback by the complete rudeness of the staff as the person serving us just walked off.
We got up and paid the bill and left.
The place was in such turmoil that I could have walked out and not paid, which I could have easily done. But I am not that type of person
Apparently Jamie Oliver, Keanu Reeves have eaten there, I'll Guarantee that they would not have been treated like that,Richard, as glad as I am to know you and your group enjoyed your meals with us so much, I'm very sorry for the impression we left you in terms of service right at the end. It's true -- we're a very busy restaurant, and our waitstaff focus on getting your dishes to you as fast as possible so that the next table can be seated. That said, you definitely shouldn't have to deal with rude treatment, and I'd like to apologize that your visit was cut short because of it. 

I hope you may consider giving us another shot one day.

"recommended to us by our grey line tour guide. Said it was the best restaurant in china town. WE agree.

tables are set up ""family style"". you have other guests in a table for 6 or 8. great way to meet people. Couple next to us were from Germany.

Place is busy, noisy, and fast paced.  Great experience. Food was terrific, prices were good, ambiance was A +++. Tight and compact with a lot of character.

Great place to have family see a different side of Chinese restaurants from the usual hum drum Chinese restaurants in other parts of USA.  Quality of food is superior, service is NY style (no slow mo here).

Loved it.,Michael, thank you for agreeing with your tour guide in that we're the best restaurant in all of Chinatown! Your satisfaction is my number one priority, so it's seriously fantastic to read that you enjoyed our food, ambiance, and prices so much. I very much appreciate your kind comments, and hope to welcome you back one day.

All the best,

"Sesame chicken, Bao Bing, and garlic poached scallops were ordered by the table. EVERYTHING was awesome. Glad we made the trip.

"It had been at least 15 years since we'd visited San Francisco and House of NanKing...still just as amazing. This time we had our 4 kids with us and we were able to share the experience with them. As we'd done before, we let the server order for us. Every single thing was amazing. We had Sesame Chicken that was to die for, and I believe a prawn and apple dish. Every thing that came out was incredible and gone within two minutes. I will never go to SF without visiting this place. And I don't even like Chinese food....,Wow -- what an honor to know you returned with your whole family after fifteen years, and enjoyed your experience with us just as much as the first one!  Thank you for letting us do the ordering, and please know it's the ultimate compliment to know you enjoyed each dish you were served. I can't wait to see you again.

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"

"We found this place thanks to TripAdvisor and what a treat it was!  Not just any ordinary food. Great service and was welcomed upon entering. Luckily we got there early enough to beat the long line that we read about around 6pm....hint hint. We asked the chef what he recommended to which we had a yummy salt and pepper shrimp and mushroom. Mmmm!  We also had the salad with fried sweet potatoes on it (amazing), the house favorite sesame chicken, and an order of steamed dumplings. Their hot fruit tea was delightful.  Only one bathroom stall but not a negative.  This place was awesome and we will definitely go back again!!!,How awesome it is to know you found us right here, on TripAdvisor, and decided to give us a shot! I'm glad you arrived at the perfect time to enjoy some great service, and of course, some awesome food. Thank you for taking the time to write to us, and I certainly hope you'll be back soon.

That's all I want for you!

Hope to see you again,

"My family of 4 with me included decided to eat there on a recommendation. I had the calamari which said highly recommended on menus but nothing special cheap strips. The rice is extra if added pork fried rice no where on menu does it say. Sodas in a can over priced and on top of all that if you put less than 15% tip they demand you pay 15%. There are far better places. We do not recommend or will ever go there!!,Martin, sorry that we didn't impress you. You deserved to enjoy five-star food with us, and I'd like to apologize if we fell short of your expectations. 

We take pride in offering our customers a complete value-for-money experience, so it's a shame you just don't agree. That said, I'd like nothing more than to show you what we're capable of, going forward. 

Hoping to get that second chance from you,

"I had fond memories of House of Nanking from my college and grad school days and visits to SF.  The salt and pepper squid was especially good.  I came here while on business dining solo on a Sunday night.  It was a different experience, not as good as I remembered.  Hostess was kind of brusque but that's ok I guess.  It's a good place but there are probably better restaurants in Chinatown.  I just wasn't sure where else to go so went with a standard.,Thanks for returning -- it's a complete honor to know we're responsible for those fond memories from back in the day! Sorry that you feel we've slipped since your college days, but I sure hope I may get the chance to welcome you back for some more of that comfort food you used to enjoy so much -- I know we still have what it takes.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were told to visit House of Nanking by two of our friends & it did not disappoint! The food came out super fast after ordering & it was great! Wish I had room for more!,Thanks for taking your friends' recommendations! I hope you return someday to enjoy more of all your favorite Chinese fusion dishes with us!

"We were told not to miss this restaurant and we took that advice.  We stayed in San Fran for a week and ate there for three meals.  Chef Fang is there at lunch.  He has a crisp charming personalty and will take your order.  Kathy Fang, his daughter, is the owner.  Always have the market greens.  It is whatever is available on the day you are there.  Try the house noodles.  We also tried the salt and pepper Shrimp and mushrooms.  That was our last meal.  We will be back soon.  it is a busy restaurant but they will make sure to find you a seat.,Three visits in a week? You just made me a happy lady. Thank you so much for being such an awesome customer -- it was an absolute pleasure to serve you, and I hope to do so again sooner than later.

Warm regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"It's noisy, it's crowded, you sit cheek by jowl on rickety chairs and on shared tables, but frankly who cares! Food is SENSATIONAL. We had the Green Beans, Peanut Tofu, Sesame Chicken and Calamari - all were fabulous. We had a little wait for a table but once seated service was super quick! It's not fine dining but by golly it is tasty!!,Mary, nothing beats knowing you think of our food as SENSATIONAL! You ordered an awesome bunch of dishes, and it was an absolute pleasure to serve them to you. 

Thank you for reaching out, and I hope to welcome you back again one day!

"Had no clue about this place, asked taxi driver and this is where he took us. We arrived and there was a que of about 20 people to get in but don't be put off by the wait. We were in and seated within 10 minutes. The quality of the food is incredible and for such a small price. They could raise the prices 300% and it would be justified. The place is incredibly busy and you get incredibly quick service. People do finish their meals very quickly as there is always a que to get in. Highly recommended, a must eat.,Kristopher, sometimes spontaneity is the best thing ever! Thank you for your patience while waiting in that line, and it's seriously awesome to know you thought of us as a complete value-for-money experience. I appreciate your recommendation, and can't wait to welcome you back for more of your favorite dishes!

"If you are looking for soy sauce and your food swimming in sweet salty goo like was are use to when Americans order Chinese, then this place is not for you.  The food was perfectly seasoned, had the right amount of sauce and had a freshness from the herbs.  We got there right when it opened.  The line was already halfway down the block.  By the time we left the line went around the block.  My favorite thing I ate was the soup - I am posting a picture - not sure what is was called but very good.  Chinese staff is blunt and too the point. No frills, no soy sauce, just good food.,Thank you for appreciating our flavors! It's awesome to know you enjoyed our Sizzling Rice Soup so much -- it sure isn't going anywhere, so I hope to invite you back for more soon!

Best regards,

"Referred by a local in China Town - Was not disappointed! The menu is a bit limited but be sure to ask about their 'Specials!!!! They had at least six on the evening we were there. If not for friendly dining neighbors, we wouldn't have known. That would have been disappointing for sure. 

We started with delicious pan fried pot stickers w/peanut sauce, spicy and tasty hot & sour soup and for an entrée, we fell in love with their Honey Apple Shrimp! The place was packed with close quarters to your dining neighbors but still had a good, kind of neighborhood feel to it. The wait staff was attentive but a bit harried. That was understandable, given how busy they were and noting the line waiting outside for a table. We arrived at just the right time, about 5:30 p.m. and were promptly attended to. The food came out quickly and was hot off the stove. Highly recommend!!!

This place is all about the food, not the ambiance!,Thanks for being a fan! It's fantastic to know you were referred to us, and that you were far from disappointed! You did a great job of ordering, and I'm so glad you enjoyed everything so much. 

I appreciate your recommendation, and hope to welcome you back for more one day.

"We asked 4 different localsthe best place to eat in Chinatown and everyone said The House of NanKing. We got a cab and told him we wanted to eat in someplace in Chinatown and he said he knew a place right outside of Chinatown the had the best food... The House of Nanking. 
They were all right!!!! This had to be one of the BEST meals I ever had in my life!!! If you did not eat at the House of Nanking when you were in San Francisco, you missed alot!!! 
I can not wait to go back!!!!,Glad we were recommended by five different people, Noel -- what a compliment! Knowing you enjoyed one of the best meals of your life with us is simply fantastic. \

Thank you for your awesome recommendation, and I can't wait to welcome you back, either!

"Our waiter comes by and we ask some innocent question about the menu. He says, ""don't worry. I'll take care of you. I'm chef. Do you have any food allergies?"" We told him that was great and we were in his hands.
What a terrific meal! We were brought 5-6 dishes almost in a tapas style and they were each terrific and thing we would never have ordered on our own. 
A wonderful meal and evening.,David, I'm so glad you let us do the ordering, because we sure love surprising you with spontaneous dishes the chef cooks up! Thank you for your kind words -- it was an honor to serve you, and I sure hope to invite you back soon.

"Very good food and service.  Reasonable price.  Quality of food was excellent and very different in that the seasoning and herbs were different than what I usually experience in Chinese cuisine.  Want to go back before my vacation end.,I'm delighted to have left you with such a great impression of us, Regina -- a complete value-for-money experience is all you deserve! It's always wonderful to know you enjoyed our unique flavors, because we definitely take pride in the Chinese fusion dishes we serve up.

"Count us as one the families that ""don't get it"". Came because highly recommended. We happily waited in line with high expectations and were seated faster than expected. Our server was very nice and helpful. We ordered dumplings - decent, beef wraps -ok, and the highly acclaimed Sesame Chicken - awful. The chicken was like hard fried chunks, could hardly taste the chicken, and was drowned in thick sweet sauce. The beef was also very sweet and not so great. Reminded me of mall food court chinese.  The owner took our order and was very curt with us. He spent most of his time schmoozing another table. 

Our server acted afraid of him. Our perception was that its the kind of place where staff are not treated well. I hope we are wrong about that. Overall, we were very disappointed  as have generally had much better food in Chinatown.,Your disappointment's my disappointment -- you should have enjoyed consistently delicious food with us, and I sure wish you'd been more impressed with our signature items. That said, please know that we very much appreciate and respect all of our hardworking employees. We're a family here at House of Nanking, and it's always been that way.

I hope you may consider returning one day and trying some of our other dishes. I normally recommend letting us order for you, because we know exactly what's in season, and love serving up a surprise spread.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant is a decent choice when visiting China Town.  Prices are good, food is good, but service and atmosphere is ok.  A crowded old little restaurant, with food to fill you up.,I'm glad you feel you enjoy a value-for-money experience with us on your visits to Chinatown, and that you're a fan of our food. Thanks for reaching out!

Hope to see you again soon,

"Go with an open mind and you will totally enjoy this place.  The waiter/owner asked ""are you hungry"" we said yes and the food started coming.  We brought leftovers back to room which was great for next night meal in the room and some needed downtime.,Thanks for understanding what we're all about! It's awesome to know you enjoyed a great meal with us, and that you were able to indulge in some leftovers the next day. I hope to welcome you back one day!

"The sign in the window said something along the lines of sit down, shut up, eat quickly and get out.... we waited a short time to be seated, but the line grew much longer behind us, when we hesitated with the menus, the manager offered to serve us family style, which turned out to be a great way to sample much of the menu.  Our son has a peanut allergy and the staff were very careful, they brought us, snow pea salad, pork dumplings with an amazing sauce, a mushroom dish, a garlic fish, delicious calamari, steamed rice, spicy beef, and of course...the NanKing sesame chicken.  The food came at a very fast pace; all of it was wonderful and we did our best to keep up, shockingly we cleaned the plates!  Would definitely recommend this restaurant.,Lynn, I'm glad you ate family-style the way we recommend you to, and ended up enjoying a wonderful meal with us. It was an honor to serve you, and I hope to welcome you back for more sooner than later.

"There is always a line here. Have eaten here on my last two visits to SF because so many locals say it is the place to go. I don't get it. The food is OK. And only OK. Both times. The menu features several unique dishes and we tried a couple each time and they were meh. They are known for their sesame chicken which we have had 2x and it too is meh. Nothing wrong, but nothing right either. Also, the tables are always sticky and the chairs are dusty and not very comfortable. I will try somewhere else next time I am in SF. Suggest you do as well.,Sorry you aren't a fan -- I sure wish you were! We definitely take pride in the quality dishes we serve up, and you should certainly have enjoyed a five-star meal with us. That said, I hope you might give some of our other menu items a shot one day -- we sure offer a lot more than just our Sesame Chicken!

Thanks for reaching out,
Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant was recommended by my hotel's concierge. The food was good. But I was just a little disappointed in the available selections. I ordered their sesame chicken. And it seemed that it was the only chicken entree on the menu. Unless it was just a lunch menu. Service was fine and the price was right. It does get a little crowded during lunch time however.,Bryon, I sure am pleased you took that recommendation, and gave us a shot. That said, I sure wish you'd enjoyed our selection more -- it definitely sounds like you stopped by for lunch. I'd love nothing more than to invite you back over for dinner one day, because I'm sure we'd blow you away with our variation!

Best regards,

"Just ate at House of Nanking in San Francisco.  I should have left when I saw how dirty it was.  Crowded into a sticky table in front of the kitchen.  When they served the food, it was almost as if they tossed it at us.  One person ordered egg roll and hot and sour soup and the calimari entree .  ALL arrived at the same time while the rest of us waited > 10 minutes for our food to be served.  The fried calamari was served in a freshly rinsed and WET bowl.  The waiter used his ungloved fingers to garnish the food AND handle money.  The ""pancakes"" for the mu shu were room temperature crepes served out of a bag and stacked on the food.  I am AMAZED at the line out the door!!!!,I'm disappointed to have fallen short of your expectations, and sure wish you'd enjoyed yourselves more. Sorry if the service experience we provided you with just wasn't to your liking -- I understand it might not be something you're used to, but as you mentioned, we're a very busy establishment, and our priority is getting your food to you as quickly as possible. This should never, however, affect our hygiene standards or the quality of our dishes. I'd like to personally apologize for the impression we left you with, as it couldn't be further from what I'd want for you. 

All I can hope for at this point is a second chance. I'd love to show you what we're capable of, going forward.

"A must when visiting China Town in San Fran. Fast, delicious, and quite an interesting experience! Not the friendliest wait staff, but they are accustomed to quick ordering (know what you want; quickly), and delivering.. almost throwing the food at you.. lol. It was all good though because the food was excellent, reasonable, and the service just made things more interesting.,Leigh, we love being ""a must"" in your book! I'm so glad you really get what we're all about -- knowing you enjoyed your experience with us overall is enough to make my entire day.

Come back soon!
Kathy, Manager"
"We had a very nice experience here. The restaurant is not big so tables are very tight. Get there early or prepare to stand in line outside. We arrived at 6:30pm and waited about 10 minutes. The line quickly grew behind us. The signature Nanking Chicken is delicious. Highly recommended. The won ton soup is a congee base with won tons in it. A fabulous variation from what I'm more accustomed to, where the won tons are usually in a clear broth. Sauteed sugar pea vines are another must. Be sure to ask the owner--the elderly gentleman who takes your order--what he recommends. You might get a smile.,Todd, I'm so pleased to know you enjoyed yourselves so much. Thank you for appreciating our fusion dishes, and I sure hope to welcome you back one day.

All the best,

"I researched to find this place prior to arriving in San Francisco and was double sure we'd try it when my SF friend also said to give it a go. We arrived not long before their closing at 9pm and were reasonably quickly seated next to friendly  regulars David and his son who gave us some tips and pointers. 

We clearly over ordered; onion pancake, aubergine in garlic sauce, fried vegetable noodles, sesame chicken and rice. All were good (especially the chicken and aubergine), except for the slightly greasy noodles. 

The owner plays along with the approaching curt service but he soon warmed to us when we told him we'd met Jamie Oliver who once visited his establishment, then suddenly everything was 'pukka'.

The shared tables and sometimes cramped seating arrangements all add to the theatre, the food is more than solid. 

Don't miss..,Thank you for coming to see us during your trip -- it was wonderful to have you over. I'm glad you enjoyed your dinner with us, and that you'd recommend us to others. Please, do, return sometime soon!

Warm regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were led to believe that the food was excellent, but the service was brusque. Sure enough the food was excellent (and plentiful), but the service was good too.
This restaurant is extremely popular, so I would get here early, or allow for a  wait for your table. Contrary to our guidebook, they do take credit card and not just cash,I'm so glad that you not only enjoyed your meal with us so much, but that we exceeded your expectations in terms of service, too. Thank you for writing to us, and I hope to invite you back sooner than later.

"This is not an elegant restaurant to take your significant other for a date. This is a casual restaurant where you come to enjoy great food. Service was fast. Food was delicious. You may be sitting at a table with other people (long tables). I consider this Chinese fast food .... except that the food is actually good. Vegeterian options are available too (tofu/veggies).
When you walk through the restaurant, you can see the kitchen area too.,Thanks for understanding and appreciating what we're all about -- serving you great food. Knowing we have customers like you is a reward unlike anything else! Thank you for writing to us, and I hope to welcome you back soon.

"This place seems to be a San Francisco institution. We arrived for lunch shortly after midday, 15 mins later the place was full. A cheap and cheerful type of place but the food was fantastic. The house special sesame chicken was very tasty as were the pork dumplings. A gem amongst the many restaurants in Chinatown. Definitely worth a visit.,A fantastic meal is all you should ever expect from us -- I'm so glad your taste buds were so satisfied! Thank you for calling us a ""gem"" among the other Chinatown restaurants. I really appreciate it, and please know you're always invited back.

"This Chinatown eatery is a must visit.  They have a limited menu but everything they have is delicious.  We started with the tofu hot and sour coup and corn chowder with fresh.  For our main's we had the scallop stack and the salt and pepper shrimp, which still had the tails on.,We love knowing we're a ""must visit"" in your book, Ashish!

"This place was highly rated by most reviewers and I can't understand why?? When you go in there it is very dirty. The floors, tables and chairs look worn and unclean. I am actually surprised the health department hasn't shut it down. We went in the bathroom to wash our hands before our appetizer came and it smelled of urine and was so dirty. My 5 yr. old wanted to immediately leave. I thought no lets give it a try because the food was supposed to be good. The menu was somewhat limited. We ordered the onion pie which was supposed to be fabulous. It was so greasy and disappointing that we knew we could not stay to actually eat a meal there!! The wait staff was ok. All in all I am not really sure why people rave about this place. The food didn't look that great either.,So sorry to have fallen short of your expectations. It's true that we've been around for a while, and we enjoy keeping things as traditional as possible so that return diners can feel ""at home"" with us each time they're over, but in no way does that mean we're tolerant of anything less than optimal hygiene. Cleanliness of of the space is expected in every hospitality establishment, including ours, and I apologize if you felt differently. 

In terms of food, I'm sorry you weren't impressed by our Fried Onioncakes. I sure wish you had given some of our other menu items a chance, because I would have loved to show you why our customers keep coming back.

"The food was delicious and the best value even though this is one of the most popular restaurants. The seseame chicken was amazing but be warned the appetitizers are huge so I would just order a main in future at lunch.,I'm so glad you feel you enjoyed such great value with us! You deserve to be served fantastic food every time you're over, so it's simply awesome to read just how much you enjoyed your experience here. Come back soon for that main!

"We decided to stop and eat there when we noticed that it was the only restaurant crowded while the other ones beside it were empty. We weren't disappointed. Since we couldn't decide what to order (we were a group of four) the waitress suggested that she'll bring us different things to try. Again, we weren't disappointed.,Pedro, I'm glad you decided to let your waitress order for you, and that you enjoyed her chosen selection of dishes! I look forward to welcoming you back sometime in the near future.

Warm regards,

"Small restaurant near the Hilton Financial District.  Always crowded but the service is fast and efficient.  Food is excellent and great value.  One main course will serve two people.

"Noisy, dirty, crowded and non-existent service. And that was our thoughts BEFORE we got the food. Chicken dish was awful. Beef dish tasted ok, but was served with noodles that hadn't been soaked 2 seconds. Really. They were as hard and crunchy as they are in the pack. We didn't even get a menu until a nice man on the next table (who seemed to know about the problem) grabbed a waitress and told her we needed menus.,Sorry for leaving you with a subpar impression of us -- I sure wish you'd had a better experience. We're a busy restaurant, so we do tend to be on the more crowded side, and we understand it can get quite noisy, but hygiene is extremely important to us and we take it very seriously. 

You most definitely should have enjoyed a great meal with us, no matter what it is you ordered. The beef noodles you ordered are actually crispy noodles -- they aren't boiled the same way soft noodles are. That said, there's nothing I'd like more than to show you that we can do a lot better than this.

"The waiter recommended their best fish dish- fried pieces of fish filet with strange flavor, their egg plant was good.  large quantity and not expensive.  their onion cake was not good.,Joseph, I'm glad you enjoyed your eggplant dish, but I sure wish you'd enjoy the remainder of your meal as much. That said, I'm glad you thought highly of our portions and prices, and sure hope you may consider returning and trying some of our other menu items -- I'm sure there are several dishes that you'd be pleased with.

"How is this Chinese food? How is this edible?? For the most reviewed restaurant in Chinatown, this was such a HUGE letdown. Really? The sesame chicken and the fried calamari are the most recommended dishes on their menu? The appetizers were awful, the recommended dishes were awful, the service was awful. I couldn't even finish half of any of the dishes because they were just so bad... How did House of Nanking get so popular?,Tunaidi, as mentioned on Yelp, I'm definitely taken aback by your review, as this is just not something we're used to reading. We're proud to serve a wide array of Chinese fusion dishes so that everyone can find something they enjoy, but I'm very sorry if the ones you chose just weren't to your liking. All I hope is for another chance to show you what we're capable of, going forward.

"This place is a bit of an icon, but travelers looking for more personal space beware - you'll be told exactly where to sit and its usually at a longer table shared with several other patrons. Like a Seinfeld soup kitchen experience, you'll have just brief moments to get your order across or ask for additional items. I don't mean to sound so bad here, it's actually fantastic food, it's just that every visitor seems to want to go here, at all meal times. Always crowded, but the lines move fast. If you're up for an experience, do it. If you are looking for a long leisurely high-service lunch, skip this one.,Justin, thank you for taking the time to write to us. It's true, we tend to be on the busier side for the majority of the week, but I'm glad to know you're up for the experience, regardless. Thank you for appreciating the food we serve up -- it's always a pleasure to have you over.

"Been finding reasons to fly into SFO for the past 10 years since we found this place. Some folks gripe about them taking your menus and just bringing you food. To them I say find another place to eat. I've brought dozens of relatives, clients and associates here over the past decade and have NEVER been served a single dish that wasn't culinary PERFECTION. 

Even 10 years ago there were lines out the door of a place you'd miss if you blinked as you walk by.,Your review is like poetry to my eyes! It's a complete honor to have you think so highly of us, to the point where you'd bring family and friends over for more than ten years. 

Please know that you never need another reason to come visit the city -- we give you permission to come just for us. 

Warmest regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Best Chinese food. It has a different taste than others. Ordered hot and sour soup fantastic, sesame chicken, chow mien and goji tea. Everything was delicious and great.,What an absolute compliment it is to know you think of us as the best Chinese food! You ordered a great variety of dishes, but I hope to invite you back one day so you can try even more!

Thank you so much,
Kathy, Manager"
"Food was yummy, service good. Conley downside was sitting by the door on a chilly night and having people not shut it behind them.,What a compliment it is to be awarded five stars from you -- it's awesome to know you enjoyed some great food and service with us. I'm so sorry that you were seated by the door, but I know the next time you visit, that won't be the case!

Best wishes,

"Came here on the recommendation of two friends.  It was everything they said.  The food was fresh and delicious.  We order the sizzling rice and pot stickers to start.  Both were great.  The sesame chicken was a must and a restaurant favorite.  Also ordered the pancakes with beef ( I can't remember the exact name).  It was great.  Fried rice was good but if you don't like egg do not order as this had a lot of eggs in it.,I'm pleased your impression of us matched your friends' and that you ended up enjoying a wonderful meal with us, from the soup, to that beef Bao Bing Wrap! I hope you may return sometime soon to try out some of our other menu items.

Warm regards,

"My wife and I went for dinner on a Saturday night at the recommendation of our hotel concierge.  After about a 5 minute wait outside ( cause your not allowed to wait inside) we were seated at a table for four with another twosome at the same time.  No big deal, that's how you meet people.  When our waiter came over after a quick 3 minutes, we ordered fruit tea, he told us in very broken English that they were out of it.  He then told us what he had instead of that and neither one of us understood what he had said.  We apologized and asked him to repeat it.  Again we had no idea what he said so we both smiled and said ""we'll take two"". What came was a hot tea in a beer mug with something floating in it that we didn't know what it was.  But it was very good. The beef with veggies in the plum sauce was great as were the lettuce wraps and the chicken and rice chowder. Don't come here expecting a leisurely dining experience, or well dressed wait staff addressing you politely.  Instead come here for a fun authentic experience with very good food and large portions at very reasonable prices, served by real people in tshirts.  Lighten up and enjoy.....life's too short.,I'm glad you took that recommendation, and didn't have to deal with too long of a wait. Sorry about the language barrier, but it's great to know you enjoyed your Hot Blossoming Flower Tea all the same! It's truly an honor to know you felt you had a fun, authentic experience with some great food -- that's all I want for you. 

Thank you for reaching out,

"We were lost in Chinatown and came here after looking at the reviews. 
  Packed during lunch, but it's great Chinese food.   You can't go wrong with the steamed dumplings (awesome sauce) and the sesame chicken.   They're sweet icef tea isn't sweet,  but that's not what I'm here for. Not expensive either.,Jerry, I'm glad our reviews got you to try us out. It's wonderful to know you enjoyed a great, value for money experience with us, and I sure look forward to your return.

"The best recommendations for restaurants come from friends. Or in my case, my sister who has lived in San Francisco for 25 years and who works nearby. 

My wife and I were staying in San Francisco for the first time. When I told my sister where were staying, she recommended this restaurant. She met us there for dinner. 

Our party of three simply told our waiter to bring us the best food he could. We wanted three different entrees and no rice. He brought us out a beef dish, a chicken dish and a shrimp dish all served family style. They were steaming hot when they arrived. The servings were huge and the price was minimal. With a couple of Tsing Tsao beers, the total was less than $40.00. What a deal. Highly recommend.,Ken, I'm grateful to your sister for having recommended us, and sure am glad you took it! I love that you trusted us to bring you what we knew you'd enjoy most, and ended up considering us a complete value for money experience. Thank you for your recommendation, and I hope to invite you back over sometime in the near future.

"I loved the food I had Bao Bing Wrap. I have never seen this on a menu before.  It was great.  I have never had anything like it before.  The service was very fast and although it is a small.place it was packed.,We're so glad you enjoyed our Bao Bing Wrap and efficient service, Mary! Thank you so much for writing to us, and I hope to see you again soon.

"I had read a lot of good reviews about this restaurant prior to my visit to San Francisco, however I was a little concerned when I arrived to see their very 'rustic' exterior and interior.

I decided not to let this put me off as this was all about the food! I'm so glad I didn't, as both my husband and I thought that this was the best Chinese food that we had ever eaten (and he can be quite fussy).

We had the noodle tower with beef along with the sesame chicken, both of which were absolutely delicious. The portions were huge too.

So glad that I decided to eat here!!,I'm glad your visit ended up being all about the food, Nat -- knowing you and your husband enjoyed our Beef Noodle Tower and Sesame Chicken so much is enough to make my entire day! I'm pleased you decided to eat with us, too, and I'd love to invite you back for another five-star meal.

'Til then, take care!

"This restaurant in China Town is fabulous.  Might not be much in ambiance but the food more than makes up for it.   Very inexpensive and the portions are generous.  Keep an open mind when visiting as they are very busy and the service may not be what many people expect but it will not disappoint.,Nothing beats being described as ""fabulous,"" and I'm so pleased you think our value-for-money dishes made up for anything else. Thank you for acknowledging our fast-paced environment, and that we really do try the best we can to be as efficient as possible -- I want you to be seated and served quickly, and leave with a full belly and a smile on your face!

Please come back soon!

"Went here after getting a recommendation from a friend and also by the hotel.  
The food was great and very reasonable.  The interior would possibly put people off as it is not high end decor more rustic I would say.  
Well worth the visit as food amazing although be careful as the portions are large!!,Thank you for those five stars of yours, and for being such a big fan of our food! I sure am grateful that your friend recommended us to you, because it got you over! 

Hoping to welcome you back soon,

"The service was surly. The place is just a shabby storefront. The meal was one of the best I've ever had! Thinly sliced thin scallops in ginger sauce, topped by the freshest baby spinach leaves I've ever experienced. I also had the noodles with black bean sauce and enjoyed that as well. The server could not have been colder, but I was there to eat, not to make friends!,John, I'm beyond ecstatic to know your meal not only made up for everything else, but that it was also one of the best you've ever had! Great choice of order, and I hope you come back soon to try another of our tasty dishes.

Take care,

"I travel a lot for work, all over the World and often eat out with colleagues.

This restaurant came highly recommended but none of our party know why.

The much talked about food was an incidental. And very salty. Huge portions might be enjoyed by locals but we Europeans all struggled.

The highlight of the evening was an example of how good staff are so important to the reputation of any business. Our company takes pride in this, this restaurant does not.

We were served by the rudest waitress I've every met, she argued with us before she'd even taken orders which when they turned up sporadically over the next 45 minutes were regularly wrong and served out of sequence with no apology. 

Despite gentle suggestions that orders were wrong and the fact that one colleague finally received their meal after everyone else had ground to a halt with their food mountains (but not long after the world's most expensive egg fried rice had arrived) the waitress was very offended when I suggested that in our country we tip for good service and we wouldn't be following the tip suggested on the bill. 

I have a better tip for her. Take a few days off. Preferably when we are next in town.

None of our party will be returning and will be spreading the word to other colleagues in town every night to avoid.,I'm very sorry for the subpar treatment you received on your group's visit with us. We might offer a service experience unlike one you've had before, in which we prioritize getting dishes out as quickly as possible due to our fast-paced environment, but there's absolutely no excuse for the unprofessionalism in which you described. I'm definitely sorry to have left you with this impression of us. Please know it's the last thing we wanted, and I'd love nothing more than to welcome you back and show you that we can do a lot better than that.

Warm regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Stopped based on TA reviews and would say very good Chinese at decent prices.  The fried pork pot stickers were the only let down, a little over done.  Otherwise the salt and pepper shrimp and sesame chicken were very flavorful with only moderate spiciness.  Service was efficient at 11:45am.,I'm so glad TripAdvisor got you over to visit us! Sorry those pot stickers weren't cooked to perfection the way they usually are, but I'm glad the rest of your dishes made up for 'em! I look forward to welcoming you back for another complete value for money meal with us.

Regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"First, the food was great. The place had been highly recommended and the food did not disappoint.  I had the sesame chicken - very crisp, excellent sauce.  It was served with sliced sweet potatoes.  A little unconventional, but delicious.  My friend had something I couldn't pronounce - slow simmered beef, wrapped in a pancake.  Also delicious.  The egg rolls come with a special sauce, not the usual duck sauce and mustard.  They were very meaty.  We wanted to try the fried bananas for dessert, but the waitress bluntly said they didn't have any.  My friend and I both sensed that they just wanted to clear the table for the next diners.  And that brings me to another comment about the service - when we first arrived, we were seated at a table for two in the window in the first room.  After we had placed our order, and after we had been served our drinks, we were told we needed to move to another table in another room -no explanation.  Our food came out randomly - the appetizer, which we had ordered long before our main dishes, came out after my main dish.  Then my friend's main dish arrived after that.  And no one ever came back to ask if we wanted anything else to drink, etc. They just seemed to be rushing us through.  They were very crowded with a line waiting out the door.  We were there on a Monday night; a Friday or Saturday would have been crazy.,I sure am delighted that you took that recommendation you were given, Marianne! Great choice going with our signature Sesame Chicken -- I'm glad you enjoyed it so much, in addition to the rest of the dishes you and your friend ordered. That said, the kitchen prioritizes getting the food out as quickly as possible, so I'm sorry if our timing wasn't spot on. Of course, it's always wonderful to know your meal made up for that.

I hope to invite you back sometime soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were waved in and suggested to sit at a table that clearly hadn't been cleaned. Using a rag that I wouldn't have said was much cleaner, the staff person then proceeded to wipe the table down brushing rice and other parts right onto the seats. Yuck. I wouldn't have wanted anything I was eating with (like a chopstick or silverware) to touch the table. 

We had an appetizer and the others liked it and I thought it was just OK. Something with a peanut sauce (I think the only thing that had flavor was the peanut sauce which didn't taste any better than the bottled stuff I buy for home).

We ordered from the menu and all of our meals were OK, but not noteworthy. I had a salt and pepper shrimp meal. It was alright. Peppery. Had some shrimp and mushrooms. But, other than leaving with a mouth full of pepper stuck to every tooth (which was really nice by the way), it really didn't taste all that great. My coworkers had other things, and each said they weren't all that impressed. 

One had a iced tea that must have been warm tea, with a lot of ice, and seriously -- at least half a lemon had been stuffed in the glass. You'd think that they were trying to make lemonade. 

The bill was brought over to the table and the waitress expected immediate payment. It was all very weird.

As this was on a business trip, I won't be returning any time soon. But, if I'm in the area, I would find another location to try rather than returning.,Aaron, I'm sorry we hardly impressed you and your group on your business lunch -- your experience with us couldn't be further from what I'd want for you. We take hygiene very seriously, and because we have so many customers coming in and out of the restaurant every single day, we try to get things cleared off as quickly as possible. That said, there's no excuse for that method of cleaning, and I apologize that you had to see that.

In addition, it's a real shame you weren't blown away by our food -- I'd like to think we do a pretty good job of serving up great-tasting dishes as efficiently as possible, and I'm sincerely sorry if you just don't agree. I know we can do a lot better than this, and I'd love to invite you back so that we can show you just that.

Thank you for reaching out to us,

"Took our 2 teenage boys to House of Nanking on our recent visit to SFO. It was delicious! We ordered a bunch of appetizers and 2 meals to share. We highly recommend this restaurant for families. We were told that it is the most ""Americanized"" restaurant in Chinatown. Our only regret is that we arrived at 8pm and Chinatown really closes down at 9pm so we didn't get to do the shopping or get the full Chinatown experience. If we ever visit the Bay area again we will make a day of it.  Definitely worth the time!,I'm glad you and your boys gave us a shot during your trip to town, and that you ended up enjoying your meal with us so much! I appreciate your recommendation, and sure hope you'll be back for that full Chinatown experience you mentioned. All of us look forward to welcoming you over once again.

Best regards,

"Too crowded, loud and not clean. It feels like the owner has lost his steam. The first time I ate there  I thought that the food was out of this world, after the last time I was there I don't think that I will ever go back. There are better option.,I sure wish we'd left you with a better impression of us, especially since you used to be such a fan. It's true, we get busier with each year that passes, but I sincerely hope that won't stop you from giving us another chance to prove to you that our food is still as outstanding as you remember it being.

Fingers crossed,

"We stopped in for dinner on the recommendation of a friend who is native to the Bay Area. While it didn't quite meet the expectations of his rave reviews, we had a great time and enjoyed our meal immensely.

House of Nanking is not a huge place, nor is it overly glamorous, but it's got a bit of character and was a fun spot to eat in Chinatown. Seating is family style, so we were seated between other diners and enjoyed conversation about the food with them. My wife and I ordered the sesame chicken, shrimp and mushrooms, and pork potstickers. All were delicious. Not life changing, but very tasty and generous portions served family style so sharing was easy and expected. No regrets about our order.

Just a note, I think there was an additional charge to have steamed rice with entrees, but it was only $0.75 each. Even so, this was the most economical meal we shared on our weekend on San Francisco. Great value to taste and enjoyed our visit immensely.,Luke, I'm so glad you took your friend's recommendation, because it got us a visit from you! It's a compliment like no other to know you appreciated that ""character"" you noticed we had. We want to be able to offer you a complete value for money experience each and every time you're over, so it's fantastic to know you feel that's what you received.

I welcome you back with open arms,
Kathy, Manager"
"So, we decided to try Nanking based on the reviews. 
When we arrived, there was a line out the door. We were surprised at how quickly the line moved, and we were seated after just a short wait.
This is a small space, not really anything special as far as atmosphere or,Shelly, I'm so glad that line went quickly -- I would have hated to have you waiting for too long.  It appears as though your review might have been cut short, but I'd like to thank you for taking the time to review us, regardless. It's great to know you enjoyed a good meal with us! Please do return sometime soon.

"I can honestly say that if our tour guide didn't highly recommend that we try out this resaurant we would have walked on by. Are we ever glad we went in. The chef/owner, Peter Fang, took our order and helped us through the menu. The food was excellent and we got a view of the real China Town!,In that case, I'm grateful for your tour guide, David!

"There is an overwhelming amount of Chinese spots to choose from, however I was recommended and now I recommend house of Nanking. Sandwiched between Chinatown and the financial district, this place is efficient, authentic and delicious. I didn't think I was too hungry, but entered and immediately took a window seat and was immersed in the wafting scents of Chinese food. After a spicy wonton soup and dumplings, I was content. The bill came out soon after and I was ready for sleep!,Aman, I'm honored to not only have been recommended to you, but to know you now recommend us after dining with us! Efficient, authentic, and delicious are the words we hope to be described as, so it's awesome to know you think that of us. Nothing beats knowing how satisfied you were with that wonton soup, and I hope you may return to try some of our other signature dishes sometime soon.

Thank you and best regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Highly recommended and I can see why! This was so good! I would have ordered seconds of everything if I wasn't completely stuffed, the portions are huge! Everything comes out as its ready so it's the kind of place that you end up sharing your food, but you will want to try everything so this is a good thing. Make sure someone gets the sesame chicken and sweet potatoes, it's delicious! I've seen a lot of bad reviews about the staff, to be honest I found it funny. They don't fall all over you, they get you seated when they can and they can come across as blunt but that's just their way, didn't bother me at all.,I'm so happy you enjoyed you dining experience with us so much, especially our signature Sesame Chicken, Noelle! Thank you for acknowledging our fast-paced work environment, and accepting it for what it is -- at the end of the day, our priority is serving you fantastic dishes as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

Please do return soon!

"It's a real shame that the house of Nanking clearly hasn't learned anything from previous reviews regarding the way the staff speaks to the PAYING customer. I was asked one question when I walked in and because the lady who couldn't be bothered to either look at me or leave the seat she was sitting on, didn't hear what I said, I got scowled growled and treated with utter disdain. Up the road in little italy, north beach, people go out of their way to look after you, a lesson china town could learn! I even got a better welcome in a help yourself buffet 300 yards away!
If you can't be bothered to be nice please don't expect nice people to part with their hard earned money. I won't be back, there is a lot of competition in your area and I'll enjoy going to it.,I'm sincerely sorry for the complete lack of service you've received. There's no excuse for the kind of treatment you received, and I'd like to apologize for leaving you with a subpar impression of us -- that's far from what we'd want. I will be speaking to my team about this, and I hope you may consider giving us the opportunity to show you that we can do a lot better than that.

"We were rushed to place our order (waitress checked on us 5 times before we had enough time to look at the menu).  We must have offended them when we asked if they had any sweet and sour dishes because they continued to look at us and glare throughout our entire meal.  They made my 17 year old son very uncomfortable.,I'm sincerely sorry that you felt so rushed on your visit with us.

"It was suggested  by tour guide as well as a shop keeper from china town. I thought of tryin with my wife.
Its ambiance is very ordinary. But i saw it was full all the time.
We ordered  nanking chicken & hot n sour soup. Quantity was sufficient & taste was awesome. prices are reasonable.
Only one annoying this is the waiter. He was expecting a lot o tip. For a bill of $19.24 i paid $5 tip. Still he was annoyed. Plz suggest ,me how much too keep tip LOL,I sure am glad we were recommended to you, because it got you and your wife over to enjoy a complete value for money experience with us!

"During a recent trip to San Francisco we ate at House of Nanking.  We were referred by a friend and were told they are famous for their peanut sauce.  Well, we were not disappointed.  We ordered fried potstickers and steamed pork dumplings.  The peanut sauce was awesome!  We then shared an entree and for less than $20 we had an authentic chinese dinner that was delicious and right in the heart of China Town.  What more could one ask for?,Lisette, I'm so glad your friend referred us, because it got you here! You ordered just right for the two of you, and I'm so glad your expectations were met, especially the ones you had of our peanut sauce!

"I giv this 5 stars basedon the quality of the food and the oveall ""Nanking"" experience. 
The good we ate was fantastic and seriously considered eating there a 2nd straight night.  The seating, like the food, is family style.  You might sit next to strangers,   But that adds to the experince.     You simply cannot go wrong if you seek authentic chinese food. 

Arrive early.   Otherwise there will be a line.,There's truly nothing better than knowing you enjoyed your food so much -- it's especially wonderful to read you got that ""Nanking experience"" I hope to provide you with. I know you only considered dining with us again on that second night, but please do come back and make that happen! 

Thank you for a fantastic review,

"Food was so, so and service was disappointing.  Felt like our food was almost thrown at us.  Not welcoming at all.  Only saw the waitstaff smile at each other; not at the customers.,Susan, I'm very sorry to have disappointed you. We hold high expectations when it comes to our food and service, and I'd like to apologize for dropping the ball. I hope you might give us the chance to perhaps try some other dishes and see what we're all about.

"I lived in San Francisco for 4 years and I miss a lot of the food there, but mostly the Asian food and House of Nanking specifically. There is mostly always a line outside, which is a compliment to its food and service. One tip - let the waiter decide what you eat. Just say ""food for four people, we prefer chicken and beef"" or something along those lines. Just let them bring you food - it's all great and a good way to try something new!,Please know we miss you, too, especially seeing as you seem to be a House of Nanking expert! Thank you for your excellent recommendation -- I appreciate your review, and hope to welcome you ""home"" soon.

"We recently took a customer and his wife to this gem in Chinatown.  They are locals and had never been, due to the fact that they were mentally challenged by letting them order your food.  Wow, they were truly excited after they finished their meal and are now taking all their out of town guests to this jewel.  There are none better if you are looking for authentic chinese food at VERY reasonable prices.  How can you go wrong when the owner picks your dishes based upon what is fresh!

Have a little fun and check them out.  You can buy your beverage of choice next store and drink it while you wait in line.  It is worth it!,Jen, I'm so flattered to know you brought a customer (and his wife!) over to visit us, and that you all enjoyed your meal so much.

"We stayed near by and was given the recommendation to eat here. We went for dinner and we were seated right away. We had the potstickers for an appetizer which were delicious! My wife had the nanking chicken and I had the house noodles with chicken. The portions were large! The food came quickly, which was nice. We both loved what we ordered and ate all of it! The flavors of everything were fresh and delightful. I would recommend eating here when you're in the area.,Grady, I'm definitely grateful that we were recommended to you during your visit to the city! It's great to know you enjoyed your quick service, and savored every mouthful of your dishes. Thank you for passing on that recommendation -- it means the world to me!

Hope you'll be returning one day,

"We went for lunch and had their dried braised green beans, which ate in a sauce with garlic (easily serves 3-4) and their sessame chicken, which comes with thinly sliced sweet potatoes and I thin celery root in a sweet sauce.  The beans are always excellent.  The sweet potatoes were excellent but some of the chicken were more crisps this time we had the dish which is very popular and serves 2-3.  Very reasonable and homestyle seating, long tables for two touching each other,Linda, thanks for your fabulous descriptions of our dishes -- what a joy it is to know you enjoyed the flavors and portions so much! I hope you're thinking about returning soon, because we miss you already.

All the best!

"The food here is great.  The sesame chicken is always good, and the eggplant appetizer is excellent.  Friends had the salt and pepper shrimp, which was surprisingly good, and the fresh fish (very good, too).  
There is often a line to get in, but it moves fast.  Seating can be at a table for 6 shared with other, which is part of the atmosphere.  
Expect that they might need more than one try to get the drink orders right, and that the entres won't come after you've finished your appetizers.  The food simply comes out of the kitchen when it is done!  
One of my favorites in Chinatown.,Charlie, there sure is nothing like knowing we're one of your favorites in all of Chinatown! From the Sesame Chicken, to the fresh fish, I'm so glad you enjoy our dishes so much -- our main priority is definitely satisfying your palate. 

Come back soon!

"We came here for dinner with our family.  We had read the reviews, so we were prepared to be encouraged to eat and go.  This was not the case, though.  Maybe it was the time of day, but they weren't too crowded yet.  We ordered the sesame chicken, fried peanut tofu, steamed dumplings and fried rice.  The sesame chicken was the best!  The sweet potatoes were thinly sliced and covered in the sauce.  The dumplings were great too!  We also had the goji berry tea and it was so good!  I loved the berries floating in the top.  It was a unique experience and so glad we went!,Monica, I'm so glad your first time with us went so well, and that you visited at such a perfect time. Great choice going with our signature Sesame Chicken -- it's fantastic to read that the dish lived up to, if not exceeded, your expectations! I can't wait to welcome you back for another unique experience with us. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"This is a hole in the wall that gets a flood of people who come from all over the world to eat. It is shabby but the food is great. The service is efficient and abrupt. A terrific experience.,Thank you so much for writing to us, and more specifically, for appreciating what we have to offer -- we guess that's where the expression ""never judge a book by its cover"" comes from! You deserve nothing short of an experience, so it's a huge compliment to read that we gave you one.

Looking forward to your return,
Kathy, Manager"
"This place was recommended to us by a local, and it was so good. It doesn't look like a place you would eat at, nothing special from the outside. We both ordered hot tea and it came in a huge beer mug, which was kinda different and it had goji berries floating on top, very flavorful and fun. Started with wonton soup, which looked different than the normal, looked kind creamy because it had crunchy rice in it, I was actually a little unsure about it at first based on how it looked, but oh man, it was SO delish! Everything tastes so fresh and flavorful, not just salty like most Chinese food. We got the pork egg rolls, which were perfectly fried with a yummy dipping sauce, again clearly freshly made, no bright red stuff like at your usual Chinese food place. For entrees we got the sesame chicken (ask for a bowl of rice because it doesn't come with rice) and we got the house noodles. Both entrees were amazing, super fresh taste. Sesame chicken came with thinly sliced sweet potatoes, which was a fun and different twist. The house noodles are homemade and served with shredded pea shoots (I think that's what they're called?) on top. Both dishes were so good, best Chinese food we've ever had! If you're in San Fran, go here! You won't be disappointed!,Your review was an absolute delight to read -- thank you so much for the awesome descriptions of your dining experience with us! From your tea, to your appetizers, to your mains, it is absolutely flattering that you enjoyed your meal so much. There's honestly nothing like knowing we exceeded your expectations, and I hope to continue to do just that. Thanks for your recommendation, and I can't wait to welcome you back for more of the best Chinese food you've ever had!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Rudest waiter I have ever experienced.  They automatically added a mandatory tip in front of us. Said it was going to be added regardless of # of guests. Will not recommend.  Food was just ok. March 19, 2015.,Brock, I'm very sorry to read of your dining experience with us last Thursday. Serving you fantastic food is our number one priority, and it should blow you away each time. I apologize on behalf of the restaurant for missing the mark, and I'd love to welcome you back for a second chance.

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"Delicious Chinese food! My group shared all our meals, so I was able to try many different items including the dumplings, sesame chicken, and potstickers. All were fantastic! 
It was very busy when we went by, but we only had to wait outside for a few minutes. The waitstaff gets people in and out very quickly- don't plan on sitting around after you eat. 
I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!,I'm delighted to know you enjoyed your meal with us! You did a smart thing by ordering a bunch of dishes and sharing them family-style -- that's the exact way our servers recommend doing things. I'm aware of how busy we get, but I'm glad you didn't have to wait long at all to be seated. Come back soon!

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"Best chinese food I have ever had! GREAT DUMPLINGS, great noodles, melt in your mouth fish. I can't wait to go back again!!!,Allison, what a compliment it is to know we're your favorite Chinese food ever! Can't wait to have you back for those dumplings you love so much.

Come soon!

"I live in San Francisco and try to take friends and family here when they visit. The service is fast so it's good to know what you want. Everything is delish. Don't think about hanging around after you eat. They get you in and out quickly. I like the whole experience. Best things to eat: Garlic Fish, Pan Fried Potstickers and anything with the yam.,I'm so glad to know you're a local, and I'm especially pleased that you try to bring a group with you when they're over visiting. From the service to the food, it's completely flattering to hear you enjoy the entire experience we offer. Hope to welcome you back soon for more of those yams!

"We were visiting SF from Scotland in December '13 (sorry, a while ago!) and are now planning our trip there in late spring. We loved House of Nanking! Service is 'brusque' (not relaxing - but you can always choose somewhere else if you want to relax - food might not be as good though!) and you are seated at mainly communal tables. The place was packed, great atmosphere. No wonder - the food is quick, hot & super-tasty! So delicious. We loved it & can't wait to return in early June, keep 3 seats for us, cheers! ;-),Keriza, better late than never! Thanks so much for leaving us a review, and we hope your next experience with us in late spring will be even better than the one you had two years ago. Since you're coming all the way from Scotland, we'll definitely have to make sure we have three empty seats waiting for you.

See you soon!
Kathy, Manager"
"We stopped and asked if we could get a table for 3, including a child in high chair or stroller (it didn't really matter to us, he just couldn't sit in a regular chair.) They said they wouldn't accommodate and were happy to turn us away without hesitation. It's quite a small place, so it's understandable but still frustrating.,Bryce, it sounds like you may have caught us at our busiest, and I'd like to apologize on behalf of the restaurant for not being able to accommodate you the day you stopped by. I'd like nothing more than to get a second chance from you, so I hope you may consider coming in a little earlier, so that we can guarantee you and your family a seat with us.

Warm regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Visited with our two sons (age 14).  All thought the food was fantastic.  Service was good despite it being busy.  Crisp fresh vegetables, tasty dishes.  What more can we say?,Ed, we're so glad you and your entire family enjoyed your food so much. It's true, we tend to be quite busy, but it's wonderful to know you still thought highly of our service. I hope to welcome you back for more of those crisp, fresh vegetables and tasty dishes you loved so much!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"We ate some good Americanized Chinese food here.  What made it fun in a weird way was the highly brusque service and the communal feeling tables.  We were pretty much ordered around by the Chinese woman in charge and it cracked us up!,It was truly refreshing to read your review, since it's clear you understand what our unique service experience is all about. I'm so glad you had an entertaining visit with us, and can't wait to welcome you back.

All the best!

"No trip to San Francisco is complete without a trip to Chinatown.  They have some of the best food available in the city.  It can get crowded towards 8pm and on.  The wonton soup is really good.,Tim, we love being part of the completing factor to your trips to the city -- knowing you think we have some of the best food in San Francisco is the ultimate compliment. Thanks for taking the time to review us, and I hope you may return soon.

Can't wait to have you back for that wonton soup you love,
Kathy, Manager"
"inexpensive cheap chinese...plain and simple. some shared benches so 8 or (2x4) can be accommodated. no dish was great . run down and on the dirty side...certainly not for everyone.,Charles, I'm sorry to have left you with a subpar impression of us -- that's certainly not something we're used to giving our customers. You should enjoy fresh, delicious dishes whenever you visit, and it's a real shame that you didn't find any of the ones you ordered great. We do, however, take hygiene very seriously, and would never compromise your well being. That said, we'd love it if you'd consider giving us another chance, to prove to you that we are in fact worth coming back to!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Our first time to have Chinese in San Francisco & in Chinatown no less. It's a crazy busy restaurant with little or no ambience. The food was pretty good but not the best we've ever had. The potstickers were over done and too crispy for our liking so we should've had the dumplings. The melt in your mouth calamari didn't melt in your mouth but was a nice change from deep fried and battered squid most other places crank out & the sesame chicken was pretty good. The fried rice was probably the best dish we had. Service was all right but hectic. We certainly wouldn't linger here & suspect that is just fine and dandy by the restaurant.,Patricia, as glad as I am to hear you were a fan of our House Fried Rice, Sesame Chicken, and calamari, I'm disheartened that you felt we lacked ambiance. It's true, we're more of a no-frills place, and most of our days tend to be busy, but that should never take away from your overall experience. I'd like nothing more than to prove to you that we're better than that, and hope you may consider returning to Chinatown to pay us a second visit.

Fingers crossed that you'll be coming to try those dumplings,
Kathy, Manager"
"This was recommended by one of our tour guides.  If you like Chinese cuisine, ya gotta check this place out.  We ordered some of the pot stickers, hot and sour soup, chow mien and sesame chicken.  The portions are large enough for two to three people, so we were able to share.  The food was absolutely awesome! The restaurant was clean and very busy.  We had read other peoples reviews that their service was not good or the staff seemed unfriendly.  After having been there, my take on it is they are busy serving good food and don't have time to pull out your chair for you or pat your butt.  They were prompt taking our food and drink orders and prompt in the delivery of our food.  I will eat there every time I come back to San Francisco..NO QUESTION!!,The title of your review alone is enough to make my day! I'm so glad you took your tour guide's recommendation, and ended up having such an enjoyable experience with us. It means so much to me that you seem to understand the way we do things -- and for that, I thank you! Hope you'll be returning soon for some more of that sesame chicken.

Can't wait to welcome you back,
Kathy, Manager"
"If you come here try the chicken, which is amazing, and the melts in your mouth calamari.

For drinking get the tsingtao beer.,Five stars, Murad? I'll take 'em! It was truly an honor to serve you, and I'm so glad you enjoyed your chicken and calamari dishes so much.

Hope to welcome you back for another Tsingtao,
Kathy, Manager"
"I went for dinner with a colleague on Thursday evening. The restaurant was very crowded and we had to stay in a line to get a table. I consider this a good sign consistent with the high rating on tripadvisors. Not huge but interesting menu. The waitress was incredibly rude and didn't even leave the time to complete our order. Isn't in the interest of the retaurant that the customers order food??
The vegetable dumplings were very average, with little savour. The fried eggplant who was supposed to be spicy was not spicy even at the slightest. I asked for some chilly sauce and the rude waitress threw on the table a quite dirty jar collected from next table. The jar was totally empty (!!).
When it came time to pay they told us that they don't accept cash and we have to pay by credit cards.
I don't understand how they can score so high on tripadvisors with all the better restaurants in SF,Daniel, I'm extremely disappointed to have left you with a subpar impression of us. You should enjoy excellent food and efficient service with us each time you visit, and I'd like to sincerely apologize for falling short of your expectations. We tend to be rather busy, but that's absolutely no excuse for the way you were treated by your server. Please know that I will be discussing your experience with my team shortly, and I speak on behalf of the entire restaurant when I say I hope you may consider giving us another chance to prove to you that we are indeed worth a second shot.

Best regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"I was here recently and ordered mu shu pork. The only way I would have identified it as mu shu was that it came with wraps. The wraps were as thick as tortillas. The mu shu had corn, peas and pineapple in it. It wasn't anything like I have ever had. Maybe it is to someone's taste, but we found it way too sweet.

Service wasn't great, but not anything different than I would expect.,Cece, I'm disappointed to hear you weren't a fan of our Mu Shu Pork. The truth is, our recipes are actually based off Chinese fusions in line with the history of the restaurant, so certain dishes we offer may not taste like what you're used to. That being said, we sincerely hope you may consider returning once more, so we can show you what we're really about.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"The food at House of Nanking is amazing especially the steamed dumplings and sesame chicken. The service is quick and good value for money.,I'm so glad to have left you with such a wonderful impression of us! Those dumplings and sesame chicken sure aren't going anywhere, so I hope to welcome you back soon for your favorite dishes, speedy service included!

Warmest regards,
Kathy, Manager"
"Found recommendation online.  Walked up no reservation!  Small and tight space but seated shared tables.  Very quaint and cozy.  The menu is small but everything was absolutely fabulous!  We had the steamed dumplings, sesame chicken, beef wrap and scallops.  A-ma-zing!  Will go again!,Arnold, I'm delighted to know you enjoyed both our cozy atmosphere and dishes so much! You made some excellent choices on your visit, and I look forward to welcoming you back for your absolute favorites again soon.

"We stumbled upon this restaurant by chance.  It seems the restaurant has two dishes that are quite popular and every table seems to be ordering one of the two dishes.  One if the chicken with sweet potatoes and the other is the lettuce wraps with chicken.  I liked that both dishes were different from what I usually see on a menu in a Chinese restaurant.  This was our last meal before leaving for the airport and we still needed to ride our bikes back to the hotel.  We told the server that we were on a schedule.  Our meals were brought out quickly, water glasses were replenished regularly.  Food was great.  This was a fun find.,And I feel so lucky that you stumbled upon us! I'm delighted to know you enjoyed the diversity of our two most-loved dishes, and on top of that, that you were so well taken care of before your flight. We hope to welcome you back sometime in the future, whenever that may be!

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"Regardless of what you hear about this place, avoid it.  Food is mediocre at best and the service is absolutely some of the worst I have experienced.,Scott, it's quite devastating that we've left you with a subpar impression of us. You should enjoy delicious dishes and attentive service with each visit, and I'm so sorry if this just wasn't the case. Please do not hesitate to contact us at (415) 421-1429 should you wish to discuss this matter further -- I'd love to show you what we're really about.

Best regards,

"Family style seating, there is usually a wait around the building and no reservations but it's SOOOOOO worth the wait!!! The view isn't bad outside either -- take it all in! Sesame Chicken👍👍👍,Jessica, knowing you think we're SOOOOOO worth the wait is an an absolute honor! I can't wait to welcome you back for that Sesame Chicken and view.

Take care,
Kathy, Manager"
"The Good - food was quite nice, no complaints

The Bad - just about everything to do with the service - long wait once seated before order taken (at least 20 mins). Friend's food arrived 15 minutes before mine, and he finished his main course before his rice arrived 30 mins later.
We were not going to warrant this worthy of any tip at all, but left $5 for a$59 bill, as a basic courtesy only, only for the waitress to argue with me that I MUST leave much more, at least $9.
I tried to reminder her that the tip was at my discretion and as the service was really bad, that was my choice to leave $5. I have never ever been to any restaurant in my life that has questioned the amount of tip given, even when I have left nothing. Very irate, would advise people to stay clear unless they are happy to be on the receiving end of this behaviour !,As glad as I am to know you enjoyed our food so much, I have to say I'm pretty bummed to read about your disappointment in our service. We're generally a very busy restaurant, but it looks like our servers could've had better timing, and I sincerely apologize that we dropped the ball. 

There's also no excuse for the way you were dealt with at the end of your meal. Our servers work hard to bring you a unique dining experience, and I apologize that this wasn't achieved, but you should always feel comfortable coming to me, or anyone on my team, if there are any discrepancies. Overall, I speak on behalf of the entire restaurant when I say I'd love the chance to welcome you back once more to show you what we're really about.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"Loved the food here and was one the best meals we had in San Francisco.

We were recommended this place and the food did not disappoint.

The soups and the chicken were excellent.,Vikram, reading we were one of the best meals you had during your visit to the city truly means the world to me. I'm so glad you took that recommendation, and can't wait to have you back for some of our signature chicken and soups. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Was taken with business associates who knew the restaurant. In general the food missed the mark unfortunately. We ordered a variety of dishes. All were only OK. The sauces were heavy and favors were a bit bland. My hosts were disappointed based on their previous experiences. 
The restaurant would be described as 'in the rough', nothing fancy.,It's a shame to see you and your business associates were let down during your last visit. It looks like you probably caught us on an off-day, especially since your hosts have had much better experiences with us in the past. It's true, we don't describe ourselves as ""fancy,"" but we enjoy offering great food and experiences to our guests all the same. I hope you'll be returning so we can show you what we're really about.

Fingers crossed,
Kathy, Manager"
"We shared three plates and everything was great. Sesame chicken tower with sweet potatoes was the best chinese food I have tried in years.  

The place is small and the line to get in requires most people to wait outside.  We were lucky to get a table without waiting next to the window.  A street person came up to the window by our table and started to harass us, but I guess that is just San Francisco.  we mostly ignored him.,The best you've tried in years? Now there's a compliment I won't soon forget. Hope we'll see you back in SF soon! 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"We were a large party and were able to book a table without having to wait for too long in the snakelike queue outside.  The hostess took our preferences and brought us a choice of food - the aubergine, taro and green beans were amazing, but all the food was good in general.  We had a blast.,So glad you loved your eggplant, taro, and beans, Aberanda! It's always a treat to meet folks from out of town, and it means a lot that you'd touch base after your visit. Hope you'll stay in touch the next time you're headed to SF! Take care.

Best wishes,
Kathy, Manager"
"Honestly delicious! The lines tell the story. No frills, but all good. We loved the sesame chicken, the rice soup and the sesame noodles. We didn't find service brusque as noted in other reviews...just busy. Go!,Thanks for the shout-out! This review is everything I could hope for, so I'm glad you sent it our way. Stay in touch the next time you're in the neighborhood! 

Cheers,

"A family member recommended we try House of Nanking. We went for lunch and were serviced straight away. The staff were not at all friendly, but the food was delicious and very reasonable.
Would recommend to visit this place.,Thanks for giving us a shot and recommending us to friends, Katrina! Hope we'll have a chance to see you the next time you're in town. 

All the best,

"We stopped here to eat while visiting Chinatown, and loved it! It wasn't touristy, just a good restaurant that's been there for years. Everything was so good, but for us the highlights were the onion cake and also the Sesame Chicken! Definitely recommended!,Breanna, so glad you loved your sesame chicken and onion cake! You'll have to come back and see us the next time you're traveling outside of Texas. Stay in touch! 

Cheers,
Kathy, Manager"
"Used to come here back in the 90's for their onion cakes and peanut sauce, but then I realized there were better options that did not require a line out the door for service with a frown.  I recently went back for lunch and nothing has improved.,I'm saddened to see this, Steph, especially since you've been one of our fans since the 90s. While our service may be a little different than many other restaurants, it should never come with a frown. I'll touch base with my team on this, but I hope we have a chance to earn your trust back going forward. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Food was great, place was basic, waitress a total character.  The food was not only very good, but most dishes were not greasy, which is rare for Chinese.,Happy to hear the food was as great as you'd hoped, Peter! Stay in touch and let us know the next time you're headed our way. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"We asked our hotel which place is best to eat in Chinatown and this is what they recommended. When we got there the line was long outside but it moved super quick. The service is far from friendly or personable but the food is delicious.  You are seated close to people you don't know but it's kind of fun to meet new people and see all the different food. Highly recommend this place.,Glad our unique take on dining was just your style, Lori! I really appreciate you getting in touch with this wonderful review after your visit. Hope you'll come back to see us again soon! Take care.

"Be ready for a long line that moves quickly. Seating is cramped but food is excellent.  Hostess is a little reminiscent of the soup nazi, but part of local color.  Service was quick an efficient. Be prepared to make new friends with others seated around/with you.  Overall a place to experience.,Thrilled you loved everything, RangeGuy! We know we're a little quirky, but that it just added to your experience. Doesn't look like you're too far away in Sacramento, so let us know when you make it back down -- we'd love to have you in again. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"After hearing such rave reviews I was very disappointed in the food. The service was average and the restaurant did not feel clean.,Well this certainly isn't what I like to see, chauvelise! You should be more than happy with both the service and the food, and cleanliness should never be something you should worry about. We follow all food safety guidelines down to a tee, so I just wish I knew what exactly made you feel uncomfortable there. I do hope you'll give us another shot to prove we can bring a 5-star experience to the table for you.

Cheers,
Kathy, Manager"
"This has been my favorite Chinese restaurant for years. Every time I visit SF I come here.  Don't let the lines deter you, it's worth the wait! Highly recommend the Nanking sesame chicken, the calamari, and the dumplings. We brought 10 people and sat together comfortably. Let them help you order and you'll get it right.,Exactly what I like to see, Carl! Thanks for your constant support over the years -- hope you get to make your way out to SF again soon. Let us know when you do!

All the best,

"Visiting friends back in California I was taken to this famous restaurant. Since we could not make up our minds we were treated to owners pics and favourites. I would recommend this to anybody, unforgettable!,It's great to see you had a chance to pay us a visit while you were in town! So glad those picks were spot on, and your recommendation is much appreciated. Looking forward to welcoming you back next time you're in town! 

Take care,

"Title says it all. The food is amazing. Yes, it's crowded, loud, cramped, and the service is surly.  But that's all part of the experience- enjoy it. No take-out, no reservations, no outdoor seating. Just great food at reasonable prices. My ""Scallop Tower"" was delicious, as was all the other items we had. There seems to always be a line, so just wait for a table. Right down the street from the Hilton Financial District and across the street from Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope restaurant.,You just made my day. I'm thrilled to hear our character made for such a stellar experience and that the Scallop Tower could really blow you away. It's great to know we've got a fan like you, and I hope it won't be too long before we see you in again.

Take care, 
Kathy, Manager"
"House of Nanking was recommended to us so we decided to try it.  It's definitely a No Frills place.  We got there right after opening, and within a half hour there was a line waiting outside for a table.  We ordered the Hot and Sour Soup, which was really good, lots of flavor, but if you don't like spicy, I wouldn't try it.  The pot stickers were wonderful, crunchy, and lots of filling.  Then we had to try the Sesame Chicken.  We got one order and shared, and it was plenty of food, along with some steamed rice.  The chicken was so good, again, lots of flavor.  It came with sweet potatoes, nothing like I'd had in a Chinese restaurant before.  Service was fast, but don't expect the servers to stand around a talk, they are extremely busy. Prices are reasonable and the food is served hot.  I don't think the place is heated, so if you go, try to get a table away from the door.,You'll have to tell those friends of yours thanks for recommending us, Sandy! So glad our flavor-packed dishes could really blow you away, and it's great to see everything was well worth the short wait. Hope you'll have a chance to eat with us again soon!

Best,
Kathy, Manager"
"I have been coming to this establishment since it opened in 1988. Though I don't live in San Francisco anymore every time we visit this place is calling. It has grown and expanded but the wait and lines remains. I feel it has become a tourist destination filled with people from various countries complaining about the tight spaces. However I feel the food is still as flavorful and great as the day they stared. The orange chicken is a must with the sides of Japanese sweet potatoes and chilled chayote. The veggies are fresh and there is little salt added. The fish is fresh and the pork chop is very tender. And the rice soup is freshly made and go with the fish as it adds more flavor. I have to agree this is a must visit even after all these years and though I hate the tourists that adds to the long lines any great place deserves the wait. Oh yeah get the fruity hot tea.,Wow, I don't know if anyone can top this review. After almost 30 years of eating our place, you definitely know us inside and out. Hope we'll have a chance to serve up some orange chicken for you soon! 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"This is a must stop for us every time we go to San Francisco.
Down and (not really) dirty, no nonsense. Fast service, NOT FANCY, very good food at a reasonable -yet not cheap"" price.,It means a lot that we're a must stop for you! Thanks so much for taking the time to leave us this review. Hope we'll have a chance to cook something up for you again soon! 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"I think that the food is good, I did like it, we ordered the house fried rice which was really good. then the tender calamari, also good. The house noodles, and the sesame chicken. was on the good ok side. The place is little, and nice. However the service, is horrible. do not expect a friendly server, or hostess. The bathroom needs a lot of nice remodeling, The back gave me a bad impression of cleanness. So if you are picky about places, this may not be your place. We ONLY saw tourists, no chinese people eating here. there were many other restaurants in the area with Chinese people eating, but choose this one because a friend recommended it.  Based on the service and the cleanness  I would not go back here.,I'm so disappointed to see you got this impression of us -- I can assure you we take cleanliness very seriously. This isn't feedback we receive often, but I'll keep it in mind going forward. I can only hope you'd be willing to give us another shot when you're in the neighborhood -- I know we can serve up more dishes like our fried rice that you'd love.

"My colleagues raved about this restaurant so I went along with them to try it.  There were 6 of us and we waited a long time for  a table, even though it was only early evening on a rainy Tuesday.  The restaurant was very crowded and the decor is mostly non-existent.  We didn't order from the menu -- we just told the manager to bring us a good meal and she gave us a price of $20, which we accepted.  Some dishes were good, some were less so.  A vegetable dumpling was so-so.  A large square vegetarian spring roll was good.  The sesame chicken was good.  The fried tofu was not -- we didn't even finish it.  A (Mongolian?) beef dish was mediocre.  Fried calamari was good but it appeared that I was the only one who thought so -- the others didn't finish it.  Shrimp in some kind of mayonnaise sauce was so-so.  Portions were modest so we each got only a good taste of each dish.  I went back to my hotel hungry.  Drinks (mostly non-alcoholic) and tip brought the bill to $29 each.  On the way out I saw dishes on tables that I would have preferred to what we got.  I wish we had ordered from the menu.  What I learned mostly from this visit is that my colleagues really didn't know what good Chinese food is like.,I'm so disappointed to hear you say so, Paul -- we pride ourselves on a rich history of dishes that reflect Chinese flavors and our restaurant's past. It sounds like you might have come in with specific flavors in mind, and I hope we have a chance to show you our best sometime. I know we have what it takes to impress you, if you were willing to give us another shot.

"I come to this place every time I am in San Francisco. It is a small restaurant, cash is recommended, and the waitstaff are very to the point, but the food is amazing. They will hand you  a menu, but the first time I went, I ask the waiter for a suggestion, and he asked if I liked steak, seafood, or veggies. I said all of the above, and he took my menu away and started bring me food! This was a fun way for me to try some food that I probably wouldn't have thought to order. I went back the next time with a big group, and they brought out food that we ate ""family style"". We each got a plate, then we passed around the rice and entrees. It was a great place to go with a big group. The food is really good, I highly recommend it.,Every time you're in SF? That's quite a compliment! I'm glad the surprise of ordering through our staff is just your style, and I hope we'll have another chance to see you again soon. Stay in touch!

"Our server was brusque but made great recommendations. We had the sautéed mushrooms, honey garlic beef, and sesame chicken. It's not fancy but the food is definitely delicious!,You can't go wrong with that combo -- mushrooms, honey garlic beef and sesame chicken! I'm so happy you enjoyed your visit, and I hope you'll come back to see us the next time you're in town. 

Happy holidays,

"Was recommended this place by a local cab driver. Very limited menu, which is unusual for Asian restaurants. Had Dim Sum and the sesame chicken, which turned out to be great choices. One of the better Chinese dinners I have been to in San Francisco China Town. Worth a visit for the food, but don not  expect warm friendly service, although Its efficient.,It sounds like we owe you and your cab driver a big thank you! Hope you'll come back for more Dim Sum and sesame chicken the next time you're in town. Take care.

"When we arrived the hostess asked if we had been before, to which we replied no. She then proceeded to bring out all of their specialty dishes, with allergies in mind, until we could take no more food. It is a very busy restaurant but when you taste their food you will understand why. Amazing!,It sounds like you were a real trooper, Ryan -- trying everything we could throw at you! I'm so happy you loved all the flavors we had to offer. Hope you'll come back to see us the next time you're in town!

"After hearing and seeing how busy this place can get, we opted to go for an early lunch. Almost empty, sat down immediately, ordered and got our food all within about 10 minutes! Having never been to House of Nanking (and having never even heard anything about it) did not know what to order. The waiter suggested I let the chef create something for me and I agreed. We were not disappointed. Food was incredible! The staff was friendly and helpful. Give them a try when in SF.,Thanks so much for the recommendation! You can't go wrong getting the chef to choose for you, and I'm happy you got the full HoNK experience while you were in. Hope you'll come back to see us the next time you're in town! Stay in touch.

"I'll start off by saying I am no connoisseur of Chinese food. I typically try a few different dishes at a restaurant, find the dish I like, and stick with it until the end of time. Despite this, everyone I knew that had been to San Francisco suggested that we stop at The House Of Nanking.

My wife and I arrived at approximately 6:00 on a Tuesday, just before it got busy. They seated us quickly (luckily we were only two, as there were two or three groups of 5+). The staff was not overly friendly, but I did not feel they were rude, as other reviews have stated. They were simply there to bring us the food, make sure we were taken care of, and not much more. Fine with me.

The ambiance felt like I was in a run of the mill Chinese restaurant. There was no extravagance; in fact my memory makes me think things were messy behind the register (not food everywhere, but maybe papers, like a messy desk) and wear and tear was hidden in plain sight.

The price of dinner seemed consistent with what we had been having in San Francisco. Not cheap but not prohibitively expensive. No problem.

I had previewed the menu at our hotel, secretly hoping it was out of date since I didn't see a list of dishes I typically see at local Chinese places. I was wrong, so I went with the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken. I had no idea I would be tasting the best Chinese food I have ever had.

The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. The sauce was not thin, and not too thick and sticky. Also perfect. The veggies were great too. The taste of this combination was a revelation to me. I doubt I will ever have Chinese food this good again. A sad thought, but I'm glad I experienced it. We had white rice along with the main dishes, and it mixed well with what I had. I am slightly frustrated because that is all I can say about the experience, but when I think about the dinner, my mind explodes. You have to go there at least once, and I hope you have the same experience.,Whoa, Juan, this review hits it out of the park! I can't thank you enough for this great review. It means a lot that you'd say we were the best Chinese food you'll ever have. Let us know if you're ever headed back our way -- we'd love to have you back for round two! Take care.

"An unpretentious restaurant with family-style seating serves delicious Chinese dishes.  Service is nearly instant, though your table's dishes may come out at different times.  Two appetizers is almost a meal.  A meal is almost two meals, so don't be shy.  Share.
Older reviews rank this place higher, so they may be living off their reputation on Roadfood.com.
But it is still good food and no atmosphere.,You sound like an old pro, Odis, and I appreciate you reaching out with this great review! Hope we'll have a chance to see you again the next time you're in SF. Stay in touch!

"Okay, this isn't for everyone, but waiting in line on the sidewalk, being brusquely shown to a table and given a minimalist menu, and then being hurried to order your drinks (beer or wine) and meal are part of the Nanking experience.  The food is dramatically good and comes in huge quantities all designed for sharing.  Order what you think you want to eat, and always make sure that you are not ordering too much for the size of your party.  The place is fun, but I didn't really notice because I was too busy stuffing my face.  When the meal is concluded, pay your check and get up so that some of the other poor bastards waiting in the rain on the sidewalk can get a chance at some really good Chinese food for rock bottom prices.  Okay, maybe not rock bottom, but very reasonable.  Then, you can head up Columbus for a cocktail at Vesuvio to compare notes on dinner.,Ha! I love this review, Nevadama -- you've captured our need for speed and obsession with serving great food in one hilarious review. Thanks so much for sending it our way! Hope we'll have a chance to see you again soon. Take care!

"Yes it is true that this place is very unique in that they seat you with other diners and they want to get your order as quickly as possible, but that is the fun in this restaurant.  I think you have to roll with the way they do their service and even though they are wanting you to order,the servers were very nice and pleasant to deal with.  Our food came quickly and everything was so delicious.  We never felt rushed out of there, but then it was after the noon rush so lunch was quite pleasant. We had the salt and pepper mushrooms. They were fantastic.  As was our main entrees. Very memorable and I can't wait to go back for more.  Don't pass on this delightful experience. You won't regret it.,I certainly don't regret reading this wonderful review, Vicki! Thank you so much for sending some love our way. It sounds like the salt and pepper mushrooms were a real hit, and I hope we have the chance to welcome you back for another plate again soon. Take care!

"I visited House of Nanking ten years ago with my family and all I remembered up until we visited again tonight was how lovely it had been. I now regret visiting again as it has tainted my memory of what was an awesome, fun place with great food. 

We were rushed in tonight and as soon as we sat down I felt the staff couldn't wait to get us out. I was looking forward to having our server choose for me, as last time, the man serving us had gently taken our menus from us and told us he would sort everything - which I loved! Instead, this time, we were asked brashly three times if we were ready to order and I had to prompt our server to pick for me. 

The food was great, it came very quickly and was enough to give us leftovers to take home. We were done within half an hour - I felt like if we had tried to stay any longer we might have been kicked out. 

The worst of it was that our bill came to $48 and we only had $20 notes (not because that's how we roll, but because we had just taken cash out!!) the lady who had seated us grabbed the €60 and said 'ok, all set?' And when we asked for $5 back she actually TUTTED! Now we don't mind tipping, we do it for every meal we have, but for someone to assume that they deserve a $12 tip after rushing us through our meal is rude. We've been travelling around the USA for three weeks now so we are on a tight budget, but we always give as much as we can. 

Such a shame about tonight, my good memories are spoiled! Perhaps going on a Saturday night just isn't a good idea.,It's so disappointing to hear this, Elizabeth -- I can imagine you came in expecting the kind of experience you'd had the first time you were in, and it sounds like we missed the mark entirely. While the dishes impressed you the same way, our service should have been excellent to match. You know the spirit behind our restaurant and know we can do better than this -- I can only hope you'd be willing to give us another shot to show you what we're really about.

"We are during the slow, lunch period. After being seated we waited for 10-15 minutes to order. People were getting served and completed meals while we waited. Finally, someone in our party walked over to the hostess to order. The only dish enjoyed was the sesame chicken. Otherwise, the dumplings were bland, and so were the noodles. Rice never came. Really irritating.,I can completely understand why you'd be frustrated -- we're known for getting dishes out in a flash, and it sounds like we really missed the mark when you came in to see us. I can only hope you'd be willing to give us another shot to show you what we can do. I know we can do better than this.

"Came here as it was recommended by a friend then when I read the reviews on here also I decided to give it a go. You don't come here for the ambience, although is was bustling when we can which was atmosphere enough. Service is unbelievably fast (making the most of flipping tables I guess). Portions are HUGE so be warned, the black pepper shrimp is great, as is their sesame chicken. 2 of us ate for under $50 and couldn't finish all the food. Would definitely come back,It sounds like we owe you friend a big thank-you for the recommendation, Mohammed! I'm happy to hear that the black pepper shrimp and sesame chicken were a hit, and I hope we'll get a chance to see you again when you're back in SF. Stay in touch!

"We visit San Francisco often and always go to the House of Nanking.  We have tried other Chinese in the area and it is the best. We have had Chinese in China, New York and many places in between. There is no comparison.  I really like the Hot and Sour soup. Awesome!!
We also just tell the waiter some of the things we would like and the chief make a wonderful meal.  We have never been disappointed there.  It is always a safe place to take guests also.  The only way it could be better is to be in Atlanta where we live.,Rob, thank you so much for this incredible review! It means a lot to hear we're the best Chinese you've tasted across the country. Hope we'll be seeing you for more Hot and Sour soup the next time you're in town! Safe travels back home.

"A short walk down Columbus ave from our hotel was this chinese/asian restaurant. We looked it up in Frommers easy guide to San fran 2014 and we were not disappointed. It opened at 5pm we got in at 530, the place was busy. Efficient staff (no chit chat) showed our table and we were eating within 5 mins of ordering. House noodles outstanding. Sesame chicken great. Pork sticks great. Melt in your mouth calamari was wonderful. Prawn pockets tasty bites! Good atmosphere, we had our 3 kids and no bother for staff. We ate enough for 6 people and paid $55 including pop and a beer. No regrets about this place.,Happy to hear you loved our fast and furious style! It sounds like the sesame chicken, pork pot stickers, noodles, and calamari really won you over. Hope we'll see you back the next time you're in town! Safe travels back home.

"Fun, good energy, great food.  We weren't sure which restaurant to choose in China Town. Good reviews led us to House of Nanking. We were not disappointed! We were seated and served right away. When we left there was a line down the block. With what I know now, I'd gladly wait in a line.,There's nothing better than hearing our line is worth the wait, but it sounds like we've won you over! Hope we'll see you back the next time you're in SF. Stay in touch, and safe travels home.

"If you can get over the service or lack thereof you will be pleasantly surprised by how good the food is. As you walk up you will notice a line at the door of people waiting to be seated. Don;t be picky once it is  your turn. Just sit down where they seat you. When ordering be prepared to know what you want. Dont expect any pleasantries from the waitstaff and dont expect your questions to be answered. Everytime I go I get the Chicken and eggrolls.You cannot go wrong with those two dishes. Also try the team. It is out of this world.,Thank you so much for this wonderful review, Taimata -- you've given a lot of great details for our newer guests who might need a guide to how we work. As for your meal, I hope you have a chance to stop in for chicken and eggrolls again the next time you're in town. Stay in touch!

"This is the best! House of Nanking is my go-to Chinese restaurant. The portions are large, tasty, and super flavorful! Bring your appetite. Don't expect the most hospitable service, but it's a great atmosphere and I would recommend to anyone--we bring all of our guests from out of town here.

It used to be cash only but I'm not sure if that is the case any more so come prepared. Also, if you don't know what to order ask the owner! He is usually there and will send out plates of deliciousness!,It sounds like you know exactly what we're about, Sasha -- customizing meals and bringing out hot and tasty plates of deliciousness. Thanks so much for this wonderful review. Hope we'll see you again soon!

"They were so rude!!!! I did not like the way they spoke to us. An older woman kept putting plates of food on our table that we did not even order and was rude when we asked her to take it away. As she handed us the bill she stood right at the table and DEMANDED a tip and the service wasn't even good, actually it was terrible. My aunt had a very expensive wallet taken from the restaurant and when we asked for it they yelled at her in front of the whole restaurant and pushed us out and told us to leave when we are absolutely certain we left it there. We will never be returning and I will NEVER RECOMMEND this restaurant they are thieves and extremely rude. The whole episode ruined our trip.,You're right, Krista -- there's no excuse for any of our staff to act this way, and frankly, I'm shocked to be hearing about this. We should have been able to help you find your aunt's wallet, and I'm so sorry if this wasn't the case. If you'd like to touch base so we can work on this together, I'd be happy to help: (415) 421-1429.

"I go to SF just to eat here!! Don't make the mistake of asking for a menu, just say, ""I want chicken"", or shrimp or whatever meat you feel like eating that day. Owner takes a look at you and somehow figures out what you'd like! Get over the ""hurriedness"" or lack of smiley service, food makes up for it. I heard the owner personally goes to the farmers market twice a day to get his supplies fresh. EVERYTHING IS YUMMY! Go with a group so you can order one of everything and sample as much as you can!,You've really got the right idea!

"Recommended by our hotel as a good Chinese in Chinatown at a reasonable price, all true. In fact the portions are large and best to share only one or two.

He immediately removes our menus and asks is there any food you do not like or have an allergy to we say no, he says I take care of it, within 5 minutes the soup arrived amazing within 15 minutes we had 4 main dishes on the table within 20 minutes we had 6 + rice he said is that enough food, each dish was enough for all of us to share it was amazing. We all had quite a few beers and our bill was $45.00 per head Just goes to show not everyone's out to take advantage of you fantastic place will definitely return. Just awesome.,Trevor, what a story!

"Went to the famous House of Nanking. The food was wonderful. We tried the popular sesame chicken. Delicious. Got 2 appetizers and a plate of noodles with 2 sodas and it was around $32. You can't get a meal like that in SF that reasonable anywhere else. There is usually a long line outside. We got right in. Came out to a very long line. The place is small and they seat you next to other people if they need the room. Highly recommend! I will be back.,It's wonderful to see that your first visit was such a success!

"As a San Fancisco Local this was one of my go to spots for some really good Chinese Food.  I can only describe the Food as an explosion of flavors - none of which one would ever experience eating plain old American Food.  Yes, the service can be less than stellar - unless they know you.  But it's a one of kind when it come to the Food!,An icon? That's quite a compliment, Chad! Thanks so much for the kind review.

"Many of the reviews rate this restaurant as excellent or very good. I agree that it is good value but the food is very average. All the soups appear to use the same stock - it's more like a chowder, even the won ton! The pulled beef was soaked in garlic. The honey chicken was fine but a bit tired -  possibly all pre-cooked? The service was efficient. Expect the atmosphere to be that similar to a canteen.,John, it's a shame to see our dishes didn't stack up to your expectations. We cook everything to order, so I'm surprised to hear you felt there were uncanny similarities between dishes. Your meals with us should always be hot, fresh, and unique. I can only hope you'd be willing to give us another chance to show you our best.

"You know how divey places have a special flavor all their own? That is Nanking. We got the recommendation to go here in a roundabout way, my friend thought he should call a Japanese American friend for a rec in Chinatown LOL but he was right... go to Nanking. We just beat a long line, had sesame noodles and famous sesame chicken and a type of fried rice. All were delicious and the dollar value is excellent. After this I see lots of recs for Nanking, I concur!,Thanks again for this fantastic review!

"Didn't look like much....but boy, was it good!

Went there for lunch today. We were in San Francisco for a little couples vacay time. Great meal! We didn't want to eat a ton, so we shared wonton soup & Nanking chicken. Both were excellent! The chicken was served with parsnips---I've never had before, but they were great!

Only complaint---you basically share a table with people you don't know. Oh well---if the food is this good, I can deal with that.,You've got the right idea -- if the food is delicious, that's all that matters!

We had appetizer, calamari, soup, rice, fish, chicken, beef, and vegetables.   The beef was absolutely the tenderest beef I have ever had.   You could cut it with a fork.  We had ten people that were all happy with the food.,Ten people? That's quite a group!

"We went to this location based on tips, great authentic food in a great location in Chinatown. The dumpling soup was so fresh and hot, that it takes a while to eat. The nanking chicken was really good, open kitchen, hot and fresh. Would recommend to anyone as a good experience for lunch in Chinatown.,George, it's great to hear that you loved your visit!

"House of Nanking is a nice little Chinese restaurant that obviously has a good reputation as there was a lot of people queuing to get inside when I visited. We got there just in time before the main rush so we only waited 5 minutes.

My starter was amazing - pork dumplings with black bean chili sauce. It was so tasty! highly recommended. Though I was disappointed with my main course of Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken. And the portions were enormous. I finished off all my dumplings as they were so nice so was kind of full when my main arrived and couldn't manage that much of it.

Service was a bit funny - the food was just dropped on the table with no words spoken or effort to get the right dish to the right person.,It's wonderful to see you loved your pork dumplings, but I wish you'd been as impressed with our service. While we do strive for an authentic Chinese dining experience, there's no reason our staff should be anything but friendly. We're working on this, but thank you for bringing it to my attention.

"A San Franciscan friend of ours suggested this as one of her favorite Asian restaurants. We were so glad she did! Five of us went to lunch there and feasted on great food--rice with calamari, Nanking chicken (yum), Mongolian beef, rice noodles with vegetables. Everything was delicious. The only negative was the hot tea, which was rather dreadful, but the rest was not only great, but also an incredible value for money. Can't wait to go back.,Happy to hear you were a fan of our food! You'll have to thank your friend for sending you our way. It sounds like the rice, chicken and Mongolian beef were favorites -- hope we'll see you back the next time you're in SF!

"Well worth waiting in line for - the line moves quickly. Excellent value, good service. My only complaint would be that the drink menu is very small, regardless I will go back next time I'm in San Francisco.,Happy to hear you're a fan! It sounds like we got you in quickly, which is great news. Hope we'll see you again the next time you're in SF!

"Great Food and large portions, I did feel a little rushed but since it was just me dining I didn't mind. Go when they first open at 12pm or you'll be waiting a while.,Thanks for touching base after your visit, Gigi -- it's great to see that you were a fan of our food. As far as your tip on hours -- it's a good one! Our wait can get a little crazy on the weekends, but we like to think we're worth it. Hope to see you back the next time you're in the neighborhood!

"Recommended by our taxi driver, we pull up to a line outside. Always a good sign! Taken in pretty quickly we glance at the menu when an older woman comes up, takes our menu and tell us she is gonna feed us. SCORE!!! Amazing flavors! Calamari, dumplings, beef , pork and shrimp dishes. I thought the beef was the best. If you're looking for delicious Chinese this is the place!,It sounds like you understand what we're all about, Geri, and I couldn't be happier. Hope you'll stop by for more of that beef the next time you're in San Francisco!

"Had been looking forward to going hear on a recent holiday.  It was clear when we arrived the atmosphere of the place had changed since we were there before, admittedly that was 15 years' prior. But we went in with an open mind.

Anyway we didn't have to queue and ordered, the food was nice- squid, rice and beef.  Squid wasn't quite as melt in the mouth as stated on the menu, bit milky, I liked it but it started to go a bit soggy.  The rice was greasy, not a patch on what we'd had in mission Chinese food the night before.   Beef dish was good.  

We were then barked at by a very rude woman when we tried to order something else.  We waited 20 minutes and nothing arrived, so we cancelled the dish.  We left no tip, the only place we didn't tip during our 3 week stay, the woman that served us really ruined our meal. 

Pity as we were so looking forward to it.,It pains me to see you felt this way, Ciaran, especially since you'd been looking forward to your visit so much. There's no reason for your server to treat you that way, and I'll be following up with my team on that. I can only hope you'd be willing to give us another chance someday.

"This restaurant was recommended by a co-worker (TU JOY!) so this was our 1st dinner in SF-love Asian food!  We were not disappointed.!  We got there before any line formed and enjoyed a true chinatown adventure in food and atmosphere!  The restaurant is electric! and everyone was very friendly and fun! We ordered dumplings, rice/chicken soup, awesome ""tower of scallops"" complimented with a unique bean stalk and leaves vegetable (tasted like sprouts-clean and refreshing) and a few other things- we got more than we expected;  sat and watched other unique dishes being served-my husband is not shy and the ladies next to us were treated to a ""chef's creation"" that they said was devine! (Thick wonton stuffed with fresh vegetables and chicken that looked and smelled heavenly!)  It was a great place for all - couples, families with kids, friends meeting up.  A true SF experience to enjoy and very reasonably priced.  We're from LA and I can tell you what we ordered would have costs twice as much and only tasted 1/2 as good. SO FRESH and DELICIOUS! Highly recommend it!,Glad we could give you and your husband a true Chinatown adventure when you were here in SF! Thanks so much for letting us know you truly enjoyed dining here. Be sure to pass along thanks to your friend for sending you our way.

"We have visited this location several times while in San Francisco and have always enjoyed the delicious, unique flavors of the dishes offered here.  We had Sunday lunch and ordered garlic shrimp and their house chicken with sizzling rice soup. All was delicious except there was a little surprise in our shrimp dish.  The item seemed like a fried piece of fiber or twine. I showed the waitress and she made a funny face and took it back to her colleagues were they all examined it for awhile. Then she brought back the same dish and said it was fried basil...WHAT? If you have ever cooked with basil, it will not turn into what looks like numerous fried fibers with clumps.  The waitress insisted it was cooked basil and I said we would not be finishing the dish.  The waitress apologized and did not charge us for the dish.  They offered to prepare a new dish but we opted to pass and enjoyed our remaining dishes. 
I'm still giving this a very good because the dishes that were prepared (minus strange additions) were very good but the experience did slightly tarnish my excitement for this restaurant.,What a strange and unfortunate story -- I'm so sorry that this happened. Since you've been in to see us multiple times, you know this isn't our standard. All of your dishes should be well-prepared and delicious. I hope we'll have another chance to show you our best and regain your trust.

"Always a good sign when there is a line waiting to go into some little restaurant. The couple waiting in front of us raved about the food and they were making a mandatory stop before heading back to Los Angeles. 2 of 3 diners had the house chicken dish and it was excellent. I had the tower of scallops that was also excellent. Good house wines at great city/SF prices. Service was good and fast. Never an empty table while we were eating there. We had appetizers of potstickers and eggrolls.,Glad you found us, Norris! It sounds like our chicken and scallops blew you away -- hope you'll come back to see us the next time you're in California!

"Usually there is a not too long waiting most times of the day.
The interiour is a little crowded but very atmospheric.
The food is unbelivable good!
I never had a calamari even nearly as tasty and as tender;
Also the other two dishes we had were really excellent.
The only negative thing here is the very speed-orientated service.
Still: do not miss this!,Thanks so much for the kind review -- it sounds like you were a real fan of our food! I'll keep your feedback about our service in mind because we'd never want you to feel rushed. Hope we'll see you back for more calamari soon!

"If you are ever in San Francisco, this should be on your to do list! Went there twice while having a weeks holiday in San Fran, what a truly amazing place to eat , you have to go reasonably early as it's so busy, they shut the doors on our last trip at 8:30 and still people were trying to get a table.
If it's your first time, tell the staff and they will help you on what to eat. It's quirky, fast and the food is freshly made, don't go if your looking for linen table clothes and silver service, you won't get it! It's a very quick turn over so be prepared not to spend the whole night there,  give it a try you will not be disappointed,Kendyl, it sounds like we understood each other perfectly, and I'm so happy you got the chance to dine with us twice! You've given some great tips for first-timers, so thank you for taking the time to leave this review. Hope you'll come back to see us the next time you're in town!

"In San Fran for a five day visit and two different people from back home recommended Nanking.  We went for a late lunch and scored a table for two by the window with no wait because it was 2 pm. At peak times you may have to wait in line. It is worth it!  We had the shrimp/mushrooms that were crispy and served with lots of fresh basil and onions. My husband loved the crispy ribs and we both loved the won ton soup. At most places back home the soup is ho-hum but this soup is so good it left us craving more so we canceled our reservations at a high end restaurant the next night and took our friends to Nanking instead! They agreed, the wonton soup, with a milky base and crispy rice added, is memorable. We also had an eggplant & sweet potato dish and sesame chicken. Everything was great and it came out fast. The chop suey is more like lo mein, delicious noodles in a brown sauce. The seating is very tight and you should know you will probably sit with other patrons at large tables but we think that makes it fun if you know to expect it.,You've made a great point -- doing something different is part of the fun! I'm so glad that our restaurant could be a highlight of your trip, and I'm flattered that you cancelled reservations to come visit us a second time. We'd love to have you back the next time you're in San Francisco. Stay in touch!

"I travel a lot on business and its always nice to go to place like House of Nanking rather than the sterile restaurants you end up in on business trips; I enjoyed this place so much I took my family there when we were pasing throughSFO on vacation.  This is a great restaurant if you are not to precious about yourself - the manager usually offers to choose the food for you, so its always a nice surprise!  There will often be a queue and they will want you in and out quickly - but its well worth it.  The food is excellent, the atmosphere is bustling  and value for money is a bonus.  Everything I've ever had there is good.,One of your favorites? We're honored. It sounds like you've had a chance to stop in a few times, and we can't wait to have you back for more. Be sure to say hello the next time you're headed our way!

"We ate here for lunch one day because we read that if you are visiting Chinatown this was the place to go for noodles in the city.  We were not dissapointed.  Saw some complaints on trip advisor about the service but given the crowds and the turnover I thought the service was fine.  I would recommend the chow mein - it was delicious with just enough spice.  The sizzling rice soup was also very good and very spicy.  The portions were huge.  I would definitely recommend as a great place for a quick lunch.,It's great to see that we lived up to (and exceeded!) your expectations! Hope we'll see you back for more chow mein and rice soup -- stay in touch when you're headed back to San Francisco!

"Visited here after reading some reviews on tripadvisor, and must say we really enjoyed it. We arrived just before 8 and managed to get seats on a table (with strangers, but they were ok!) Food arrived quickly, was piping hot & lots of it. 
By 8.50 there was a queue down the street for seats, as we left full & satisfied. Great authentic experience,So happy we could get you a meal you loved, Jane! It sounds like you were able to beat the lines, which is great news. Hope you'll come back to see us the next time you're in town.

"The food is fresh and hot here.  A concierge told us that this is the best food in Chinatown, and he also said this is the place where all the locals eat.  The tea is unusual (served in a beer stein - type glass).  This isn't a place to go for service or atmosphere, but every dish we tried was delicious and even those we just saw prepared for others looked spectacular.,Elizabeth, it's great to see that you were such a fan of our food! It sounds like you're in tune with our goals as a restaurant -- serving  wonderful dishes -- and I hope we'll see you back on your next visit to San Francisco. Stay in touch.

"Our porter at the hotel had recommended this restaurant as we said we wanted to experience a good china town restaurant but not OTT posh. We wandered through China town which is just brilliant and found Nanking easily - it borders the Italian area - it's very ordinary to look at, which makes it such a great surprise. At 730 we went in and the place was packed but a table by the front windows was free ... But over the course of the meal we noticed there was a massive queue of folks trying to get in... We had fab food, really different to usual English Chinese restaurants, and good sized portions. 
So glad we found it - when we left we looked closely at a photo on the wall behind where we had sat ... And there was a certain 'naked chef' visiting the Nanking.
A great end to a perfect 16th birthday for our daughter.,Ruth, it's great to hear we could be a special part of your daughter's 16th birthday! It sounds like your hotel porter pointed you in the right direction, and we thank him for it. As far as Jamie being one of our past visitors, you're right -- along with Keanu Reeves and Martha Stewart! Maybe you'll do some star gazing the next time you stop in. Stay in touch.

"You will have to wait in line for a table especially early evening, but later on (8.00--9.00) you can probably get straight in. Menu is quite short but many dishes are available as beef.chicken. pork or shrimp.

They won't let you order too much. Two mains and some rice is ample for two of you if you are hungry. Recipes are really tasty and portions generous.

Tables are close together and this isn't the venue for private or personal conversation.

The service is quick and food tastes fantastic.

Best of all its very reasonably priced.,Thanks so much for this great review -- these details are always helpful for our first-timers! It sounds like you had a chance to check out some off-menu items that the chef prepared for your table, and I'm happy to see that you enjoyed all of them. Hope we'll be seeing more of you on your next trip to San Francisco!

"China Town was definitely on our radar on our recent trip to San Francisco...but where to eat? With so many choices we were truly overwhelmed. On the advice of our concierge, we settled on House of Nan King. What a find! It is just a little "" whole int the wall"", which we probably would have passed right by, but clearly not many do, as a line on the sidewalk grew as we dined. The Chinese beer was ice cold and very tasty. As we pondered the menu, a woman we believed to be the owner approached our table. She asked if we were hungry, did we like chicken, beef, and shrimp? When we responded ""yes"" to all the above, she said she would take care of us...and did she ever! The 3 appetizers were great, followed by shrimp and mushrooms, a beef dish, and their signature sesame chicken. There were 4 in our party, and none of us were able to pick our favorite dish...it was all delicious! This was probably the tastiest meal we had in San Francisco and as a bonus, the most reasonably priced. I so wish this restaurant was located around the corner!,Bonnie, it's great news to hear our food was your favorite meal of your trip! It sounds like the dishes all came out on point, enough to keep you from picking a fave -- hope we'll be seeing you back on your next trip to San Francisco!

"Very unique style of dining.  Don't come here for the atmosphere, or for a quiet romantic dinner.  But if you want to try something new and don't mind sitting with strangers, try house of Nanking.  They ask what you don't like, and the chefs decide what to serve.  You never know what you're going to get, but it's always good.

One observation.  This is the only restaurant in the area with a line. Most others are empty.  That says something.  Don't despair, it moves quickly.,What a review! You've captured us perfectly. It sounds like you're right on board for our adventurous style, and I hope we can welcome you back the next time you're in town. Stay in touch!

"Ate here last night, the restaurant is always busy so be prepared to wait for a table but it is certainly worth every second of the wait. This no fuss restaurant has a fantastic and well priced menu, I highly recommend the Sesame chicken and the fried calamari entrees both of which are delicious. The portions are huge and the taste and flavours are divine. You won't be disappointed if you eat here!,Sarah, thank you so much for the kind review! It sounds like you were happy with the sesame chicken and the calamari, and we hope you were able to pick out some things to try for your next visit. Stay in touch!

"We followed our guidebook to House of Nanking. Surrounded by hip San Franciscans and walls filled with rave reviews we looked over the menu.  Interesting. Before we ordered the owner came to us and said, ""Have you been here before?"" We nodded no, and he said, ""Forget the menu, I'll take care of you."" Wow - the owner was going to take care of us and our two small children. We ordered some beers and then out came a plate of fried eggrolls. This was followed by something very akin to general tso's chicken - deep fried and covered in a gooey, sugary sauce. Then came a plate of fried, desiccated beef with a couple of pieces of sliced endive. This was followed by pan-fried fish - not seasoned - just fried.  Ugh. 

We looked around and quickly noticed that almost every other table of tourists was having THE EXACT SAME MEAL.  Deep fried and deeply unsatisfying.  Not only was this meal nasty, it was not at all suitable for small children with moderately health conscious parents. If I were to guess, the ""forget the menu"" shtick was just the the owner's way of making the kitchen run more quickly, avoiding having to cook to order, and plow through the line of tourists piling up outside the door. 

Desperate for something fresh for our kids we ordered a ""small"" side of steamed broccoli. 

The bill? $76 for their trouble - including $8 for a stupid plate steamed broccoli. 

The owner didn't take care of us - he treated us like rubes and gave us rotten food.  My advice - pick a place not in your tour book - avoid the lines and the insult to your intelligence.,It's so upsetting to see you left feeling this way, especially since you made a special trip to see us while you were in San Francisco. I can assure you that tourism was not top of mind when the owner -- my father -- served you. We often choose our most popular and requested dishes to introduce new faces to our cooking style. That said, it sounds like these dishes may not have been exactly what you were expecting, and it's fair to say that they may not have been to your taste. Please know that while we only had the best of intentions, we would have been more than happy to work with your family to find a meal that was both tasty and fit your needs. I can only hope you'd be willing to give us a second chance to show you what we're all about.

"Went yesterday to House of Nanking. Also went last year when food was chosen for us. Chose off the menu this time. My favourite was the sesame chicken. Superb value.

"this place is a hole in the wall but it was pack with locals and tourists; a sure sign the food is good. Only so many people can sit and eat at one time so you might have to wait to get in. Try everything!! Yum,Your title says it all -- I'm so happy to see that you felt we were worth the wait!

"We were at SF last August. This restaurant was packed with people and a long queue of people waiting out site for their turns. We did not succeed to book a table in advance, so I did not know if it is possible. 
We had the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken. This dish was awesome, warm, tasty and crispy. Glazed Eggplant and dumpling were also good choices. 
I ate too much but believe me, you could not stop. You will be super thirst after this meal, but it is worth it.,I'm so glad that you had a chance to make it in while you were in San Francisco! It sounds like you really enjoyed your meal, which is always what we want to hear.

"We had no idea of the restaurant, until the lady of hop on off suggested this restaurant. It was our first time, and the owner came to see us, we didn't had to order; he had set up an order for us and a special price! Ridiculous price!
So enjoy the food there! All good! We will return for sure!!!;),You'll have to give our thanks to your tour guide! It sounds like we were able to take great care of you, and I'm so happy you had a chance to come in on your visit to the city. Stay in touch for your next trip!

"I've been to House of Nanking many times for both lunches and dinners. My wife and I decided to try it on a Saturday night. We'd arrived around 8:15pm and found out that the 4 gents standing outside is the last group that the restaurant would take. OK, diplomatic (meaning begging) time; after pleading my case with the lady owner, she was kind enough to make us the last group. Yes.

Whenever I am at House of Nanking, I will go ""chef choice"" style. In this case, the elder gent who is taking our order. We told him what style and food we like but will leave it up to him to come up with the foods for us. Again, he did not disappoint me.

We had soup for appetizer; the soup was awesome with mushroom, fish, tofu, wonton, a few other things and all of them in a creamy perfect tasting coconut soup. The 2 of us finished a big bowl that fitted for 4. The pot stickers were ok not great so avoid them if you can.

The next 2 dishes were great. The first was the 5-hour cooked beef that tasted so good and tender like pork; I swear it was pork until he told me that it was beef. The bok choy were sweet and crunchy, which is a surprise. Make sure that you try this interesting and great tasting 5-hour cooked beef. The last dish was the baby peashoots with minced meats. My wife, who is very particular about Chinese dishes, had gone nut over the sweet and lightly crunchy baby peashoots. Either Bok Choy or Baby Peashoots was a great dish that we did not expect.

You can always order many of the good-tasting dishes from the menu: however, why would you? Have fun and go wild by asking the (elderly) gent to order for you. Sometimes, you do want to be surprise with some great food.,So happy we could get you in and curb that craving for Chinese food! It sounds like you've tuned in to our chef's style many times before -- we can't wait to share many great dishes with you in the future. Stay in touch!

"We have just had a wonderful tasty meal with our 2 children. Our sometimes picky 11year old even devoured a delicious spring roll with egg in it, something she would never do at home. The service was quick and efficient similar to restaurants we have been to in our home town london. We felt that we were eating the real deal in a cosy authentic Chinese restaurant and not a sterile chain. My vegetarian dish was very tasty and the overall experience was thoroughly enjoyable and the kids were made to feel at home.  I would thoroughly recommend it.,Amanda, I'm so glad that we were able to make the visit special for your family -- it sounds like you really tapped into the authentic Chinese vibe we have here in the restaurant. Hope we'll be seeing you the next time you make it across the pond!

"We were walking thru Chinatown and trying to figure out which chinese restaurant to have dinner.  A friend of mine emailed me and told us to go to Nanking!  That was the best move we made all week!  We had to wait about 20 minutes outside for a table for two (the place is small) but the weather was nice and lots of people to chat.  We were seated at a table for two right by the front window. We started with the best hot and sour soup we ever had!  The calamari and the Sesame chicken were absolutely wonderful!  A couple of taotsing beer topped of a perfect evening.  Go and enjoy the best Chinese food!,Happy that your friend sent you to our place! Thanks for letting me know how much you enjoyed everything from the hot and sour soup to the sesame chicken -- it means more than you know.

See you next time you're in Chinatown,

"The best restaurant in chinatown san francisco
Good food, excellent prices , good quality!
The potsticker for me is the best dish ! If you go to san francisco dont miss go to this restaurant!!,It means a lot that you think we have the best poster stickers in San Francisco, Hernan. Thanks for an amazing review!

Take care,

"I am not Chinese, but I can cook better tasting Chinese food than we had tonight. I rather think the overuse of sugary sauces (plum and black bean for our meals) fools many American palettes into thinking they are having something ""good"". A bit of average spicing, and the illusion is complete!  Added to which the coating on the ""signature""  sesame chicken was a floury, salty KFC like crispy affair, designed again, I believe, for the average, undiscerning collective US taste bud.  Throw in the legendary rude service, and cheap prices, and I guess you get exactly what you pay for.  A pretty average overall experience.,I'm sorry to hear our sauces and spicing weren't your style, David. Technically, we do consider ourselves Chinese fusion, which may account for why our dishes weren't quite what you expected. That said, if something isn't to your liking, let us know and we'd be happy to take care of it. Again, thanks for the feedback. Even though we are an award-winning restaurant, we would never want to rest on our laurels.

Hope to see you again,
Kathy, Manager"
"I really liked this restaurant. We had the waiter/owner bring us whatever dishes he decided and ALL was delicious. It was a  great experience and the food was great.

"Walked past this restaurant on a few occasions and there was always a queue so we tried it.  20 minutes to get in and well worth the wait.  Try the chicken and sweet potato.  Really great value.,Glad you finally got to check us out! It sounds like the chicken and sweet potato were a hit, although I'm sorry it took 20 minutes to get it. We can get pretty busy, but I like to think we're worth it! Hope we'll be seeing more of you this fall.

"While waiting in line, a local advised us to let the owner order for us.  Being adventurous, we agreed.  Sure enough, the owner came out and asked us if we had ever eaten there and we answered ""no"".  Then he asked if we were hungry, we answered ""yes"".  Next he asked if we had any food restrictions, we answered ""no"".  Saying nothing further, he proceeded to scribble down some Chinese on a pad, turned and walked away.  Minutes later we received the first of four courses, all wonderful including the main course, their signature sesame chicken.  Sure, no one smiles or asks you how your day has been but the food is worth coming back for.  Best meal we had during a week long stay in San Francisco.,Sounds like you really got the full experience, and I congratulate you on being so adventurous and jumping right in! It's great to see that you loved all of your food and that we could be a special part of your trip to San Francisco. Stay in touch if you're ever in California again!

"I notice that other reviewers suggest getting the servers to suggest what to eat. I find it hard to imagine anyone I saw working there take the time to do this! The place is ok and the food is ok but I really can't understand what all the fuss is about. After queuing for ages to get in, it would be nice not to feel like the staff can't wait for you to get out!,I'm so sorry to hear that you felt rushed or unwelcome during your meal with us. Our take on dining definitely mirrors the Chinese restaurant style -- busy, no-fuss, and efficient -- but we can always take a moment to talk to you about getting you the best meal possible. On that note, it's a shame to see that you weren't thrilled by your order. Like I said, serving great food is our claim to fame -- I can only hope that you'll be willing to give us a second chance to show how great we can truly be.

"The sesame chicken and garlic fried fish were deliciously prepared. We also had the steamed pork dumplings to start. The problem that puts a question mark on the ownership and staff is the service! 5 tables seated after our party of two were catered to before I had to waive someone down and ask them to take my order! They didn't apologize, even though others that arrived after us had already received their first dish. The saddest part was the lone diner that was seated next to us that entered right before us didn't get any food for over 30 minutes! We left the restaurant at the same time and chatted for over 20 minutes after exiting. We both agreed that the food was great but the service left a lot to be desired! Bring you patience for a great meal!,I'm sorry to hear you were disappointed with our service, especially since you enjoyed our food so much. We offer a traditional Chinese restaurant experience, which does require a different set of expectations. That said, you should never feel ignored. Know that I'll take your feedback into consideration, and I hope you'll be back to see us again!

"We avoided the lines by getting there early (about 5:20) but it was also starting to be crowded inside.  Fortunately, we knew to let the owner order for us.  He asked us a few questions about what we liked and we let him do the rest.  (I did mention soup, which was a great idea.)  The beef short ribs are possibly the best Chinese dish I've ever had, bar none.
By the time we left, the evening line had started to form.,Wow, the best Chinese dish you've ever had? That's high praise! Thanks so much for the compliment. You definitely had good instincts letting our owner order for you -- it often results in happy surprises (like that soup you mentioned). Coming early is a great tip, too -- we can get busy, but we like to think we're worth the wait. Hope to see you when you're back in California!

"I don't feel like I've been to San Francisco if I don't get here for dinner. The food is great - sesame chicken is my favorite - and there's usually a good mix of tourists and locals.  The space is cramped and, if I hadn't been warned the first time, I might have thought I had the wrong place.  I'm glad I stayed.,Glad to hear we're part of your quintessential San Francisco experience! As far as our sesame chicken goes, you're definitely not alone -- it's one of our most popular requests. Look forward to seeing you the next time you're in town!

"We had several people recommending this restaurant. We've tried to have dinner one day bu the line outside the restaurant was pretty long. So we arranged to have lunch a couple of days later. It was a very tasty lunch. The menu is not that big but certainly everything looks very good. We enjoyed every dish we ordered. Service was not the best: Chinese waiters impatient to explain what every dish was and anxious to get the order done. But that did not jeopardize the experience of having Chinese food in Chinatown in San Francisco. I do recommend and will go back if I have the chance.,I'm glad you were able to catch us before the end of your trip, Ricardo! It's great to hear that you enjoyed your meal, but I wish our service had made a similarly good impression. We pride ourselves on offering an authentic Chinese experience, which understandably is quite different than most restaurants. That said, you should never feel hurried to make a decision on what to order. I'll take that feedback to the team. Hope to see you on your next trip to San Francisco!

"We had to queue which was fine but we were lucky as they sent people away at 8.30 ish who had been queuing. It is Chinese food as it should be served with a no nonsense approach. Don't expect normal American service we basically had our food and drinks thrown at us and then they waited over us for payment when we hadn't finished. Luckily the food made up for the service!,I'm thrilled to hear that you're a fan of our food, but it's a shame that our service was a lackluster part of your meal. As you've said, we are ""no nonsense,"" but we still want to make an honest effort to make you comfortable. Please know that we'll take your feedback to heart and that we hope to see you on your next trip to San Francisco!

"I got the beef wraps and my wife for the ginger chicken.  All the food was good but the wraps (tortillas) broke apart. Lines can get long but we lucked out.,Glad to hear our food hit a home run for you! I'm sorry that your tortillas broke apart -- hopefully it didn't inconvenience you too much as you ate your wraps. I'll check in on that for you. As far as our lines go, you're right -- we can get busy! That said, we like to think our food makes the wait worthwhile. Hope to see you around! 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Food was good but the wait for 8 people was very long. Once we got it & ordered the food, it was fine. It's not your typical Chinese food. Best entry: calimari. Enjoy it!,I'm glad you got the chance to visit us on your trip from New York! It sounds like you may have caught us at a popular time, and I really appreciate your patience as we worked through the crowd. We can get a little busy, but I like to think we're worth the wait! From the looks of your review, you agree -- I can only hope that we can show you an even better time on your next visit. 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"Best Chinese food I've ever had. Communal seating was a little tight, but no big deal. Owner made outstanding recommendations for what to order. Was really excellent.,Wow, the best Chinese food you've ever had? That's great news! So glad we were able to give you a great experience while you were in town. Stay in touch for when you're back in California!

"I taught English in Taiwan long ago and this place reminds me of restaurants there.  My family of three was seated, then another diner was seated next to us.  The place is small and popular, and seating is communal.  The food is amazing.  I make marinated mushrooms regularly, but after eating salt and pepper mushrooms at House of Nanking my home cooked will not suffice.  So good.  We also tried Tofu in black bean sauce and market greens.  Also eggplant.  That’s a lot of food, but my son had only a small container of left-overs to take home.  We arrived at 6 pm and were seated without a wait, but there was a line waiting to be seated as we left.,We're grateful for your review here and on Yelp! Thanks for coming by to see us, and I'm looking forward to seeing you again soon. (Our salt and pepper mushrooms won't eat themselves!)

All the best,

"We've visited this restaurant with a 8-year old kid, and even she was delighted:) everybody recommends chicken in sesame, but if you really want something authentic, try hot and sour soup as an appetizier and shrimppockets with a remarkable sauce. It is a family restaurant, and the owner is always somewhere around to help with a choice. Awesome!,We're so happy the entire family loved dining with us! Hot and sour soup, shrimp pockets -- you've made some wonderful recommendations. The next time you're in San Francisco, I hope you won't hesitate to swing by!

"I'm a native New Yorker and as such I always ""knew"" that we had the best pizza and chinese food in the US.  

I still know we have the best pizza... But the House of Nanking proved me wrong about the Chinese food.  My first visit here was about 15 years ago and have made it a point to come back with each subsequent visit to the Bay Area.  Nanking has, by far, the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. 

This is a small place with a big menu. The food is just spectacular. I strongly suggest you don't miss this San Fran gem.

Favorite dish:  pork stuffed mushrooms... Simply delicious.,This review made me smile from ear to ear! We're honored to have changed your mind about Chinese food in San Francisco. Thanks for making it a point to come see us every time you're in the city. Pork stuffed mushrooms are a fabulous recommendation and a great change from our sesame chicken! We can't wait for your next visit!

Thanks again,
Kathy, Manager"
"Heard about this place in a wine bar in Temecula and had to visit when we were in town and so happy we did...this place was truly authentic and delicious.  Had the owners recommendations for first timers and oh my, yumm!  The line is always out the door and you may have to wait, but WAIT, it is that good.,We love when people come to us through word of mouth! Thanks for this wonderful review. I especially appreciate what you've had to say about our dishes and authentic atmosphere. Hope we'll see you again in the near future!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"I had been to this recommended restaurant in 2008 and had a wonderful time. On that visit, the owner waited on us. We were a bit overwhelmed with the extensive menu and he kindly said he would order for us. He had a twinkle in his eye and we felt especially welcome and special and then the food came...dish after dish of wonderful Chinese dishes...OMG he knew our taste buds. Everything was exquisitely prepared down to the cold, barely blanched asparagus with sesame seeds and an amazing sauce that I have tried to recreate at home to no avail. Fast forward 6 years to Saturday, a lunch with my husband. We were shown to our table by a waiter who did not even look at us. I thought we had incredible luck when the owner (I assume he is Peter Fang) again waited on us. I ask about the asparagus and he says ""out of season"" while looking out the door at people passing by on the street. I ask about green beans and said ""Just order for me"". My hubby ordered Pepper shrimp. Soon the green beans appeared at our table. We thanked the delivery person and again received no eye contact. Rice followed in a few minutes. The beans were amazing with a dark sauce laden with minced garlic, sesame seeds and soy. Next came the pepper shrimp...so-so. Nothing special and we won't order it again. Maybe I'm needy but I appreciate when people look at me and acknowledge my presence. The gal who collected our money finally looked at me and said, ""sign here..."",I'm sorry we didn't live up to the memories you previously had. But we'll be sure to work on making eye contact -- it's definitely not too much to ask. I'm at least happy to hear you enjoyed your dishes. Hope you'll come back to see us again the next time you're in San Francisco!

"Twice a year for almost 8 years we have visited this restaurant.  I have recommended it to many friends and have never been told it was off.  I had the scallop tower which is my favorite.  No other restaurant that I have visited has this on the menu. If you like scallops, you will love this.  Big fat juicy scallops on a slice of eggplant.  It's 6:30 a.m. And I wish I had some now!!,Love this review! We're honored to be your must-visit spot in SF. Great recommendation with our scallop tower -- it's one of my favorites, too. Thanks for coming to see us over the years, and we're looking forward to the next visit!

See you soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"Learned of this place from a local and it did not disappoint.  The 2 appetizers and 4 entrees were so good.  (Potstickers, Pork Eggrolls, Pork Stuffed Mushrooms, Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Sesame Chicken, Jade Spinach Salad with Pork.)  We got lucky with a short wait time but it would have been worth our time had it been longer.  Don't expect super friendly service - the culture is not the same as American establishments.  You will get efficiency and really good food.  It is not in the middle of Chinatown but rather on the edge so it's not in the hubbub of all the touristy stuff.,No one knows us like the locals do! Thanks for following the advice and coming to see us. I'm happy to hear how impressed you were with all of your dishes and grateful that you get our authentic charm.

Come back and see us again soon, OK? 

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"There was a sizeable queue when we arrived but they move people through very quickly. Drinks for kids came like lightning - can and a straw basically. Food was excellent - and although a bit surly, service was good - certainly quick. Worth the queue.,We pride ourselves on our quick service and delicious food, Neil. Thanks for noticing and pointing it out in this review! Glad you all enjoyed your time with us, and I hope you'll come back and see us again soon!

"Had to wait for a table and the service was a little confusing. But felt like an experience food was amazing, best chineese I've ever had and really cheap. If you're in san Francisco eat here.,Sorry if we confused you, Dominic. But it sounds like we made up for it in delicious food! Happy to hear you had such an outstanding time with us. Come back and see us again soon, OK?

"You can't book, so you need to line up outside or be really early to get a table. When you get in, service is extremely quick. Food is quite ""simple"" but very, very well cooked. You will finish a 3-4 course meal in 45 minutes. Then you need to give space to new guests. It is a family business and you can feel it. The oner himself seated us and served us. Lovely visit. Will absolutely return.,Sounds like you get us, Maria! Thanks for the 5 stars. I couldn't be happier to hear how much you enjoyed your time with us! We are family, and I'm so glad you could tell. Come back and see us again the next time you're in San Francisco, OK?

"Dear Kathy F, Manger of House of Nanking: Since this is my ONLY avenue of communication I apologize for the public forum BUT, in all fairness you've left me no options. As you can see by my credits and if/when you read my many reviews I REALLY do love to be positive and help businesses since I've been in the business world myself and count on client referrals.SO, why this review? Your website says to CALL you for reservations but I called for hours and nobody answers. I researched for months including asking CA clients for THE best Chinese restaurant in SF and you came up time and time again so, of course, I wanted to come here with husband and extended family in September. Having a group of 10 means that we really need to make a reservation but if I can't get hold of anybody...well? What to do? Send a carrier pigeon?! I even tried the email in your Contact but it sent me back to CALL! SO, that said, can you please make us a reservation for Thursday, September 11 @ 6 p.m. for 10 people under my Tripadvisor name of Lili1012.? I look forward to hearing from you...and, especially to being able to write my usual positive review after actually eating at House of Nanking!,Hi! Thanks for getting in contact with us. We have you down -- Sept. 11, 6 p.m., party of 10. 

See you then,
Kathy, Manager"
"i came saturday around 3-4pm, no wait for me, single diner, but a few people had to wait here and there, but it moved pretty quickly. no lines down the sidewalk that time of day. good food. good list of items to choose from for less than $10. it was really good. i ate it all.,Sounds like you picked the right time to come see us, Rachel! Thanks for swinging by. Was this your first visit with us?

I couldn't be happier to hear how much you enjoyed your time with us, and I hope you'll come back and see us the next time you're in San Francisco!

All the best,
Kathy, Manager"
"This wasn't our first choice... But not to say our first choice would've been any better... I just refuse to wait in line for more than 15-20 minutes for a table when on vacation... This place is for tourists who want to play it safe. 
Pass on the won ton soup... Or I should say milky won ton soup... Pass on the pot stickers... Egg rolls were great... House special chicken was fine and the house noodles also fine. They wouldn't let us order the salt and pepper shrimp because they said we ordered too much... Which we didn't... But anyway... Don't regret coming here- all of that was 40.00 including a tip but I would try somewhere else next time.,We're glad you gave us a try during your time in San Francisco. We like to think we're a spot for both tourists and locals! In fact, one of our favorite things to do is order for our guests. Next time, I'd suggest letting us do that for you. You won't be disappointed -- promise!

"Had lunch here in early July.  Was as good as we remember the food being 25 years ago, when we last visited. Would've returned for a second meal but there are just too many great places to eat in SF.  We'll be back on our next visit!,We are so excited about this review! It's been 25 years, but we're so happy we've stood the test of time. We hope you come back and see us soon! No more 25-year drought, OK?

"Went to this restaurant based on lonely planet recommendation and worth it - authentic Chinese food not westernised stuff which you get in lots of other places. Service really quick and we ate for about $25 including tip. A great place to eat.,Thank you for spreading the word, Rebecca! It's great to hear that you enjoyed everything from our serve to our food. We hope to see you again sometime! 

Sincerely, 
Kathy, Manager"
"This came recommended form one of our cab drivers, with all the places to eat in China town, this was the only one with a line out the door on a Monday night.  The line held locals and tourists alike.  The food was great, we tried 3 items and could not decide which was the best because they were all so good.  I would describe the service as very attentive, nice way of saying they want to turn the tables quickly so the folks waiting inline can get in to eat.  This is not the place were you are going to linger over an after dinner drink, do that some where else, but come here to eat great Asian food.,With a line like ours, it can be hard to find time to linger after dinner. I'm sorry if you felt rushed, Kevin, but I'm thrilled that you loved our dishes! What did you order? Come back and see us during your next trip to San Francisco, but until then, thanks for the wonderful review!

Kathy, Manager"
"Let me start by saying I really wanted to enjoy this restaurant. The food reviews are all really tip top, and it was close to our hotel too. We love Chinese food and were excited to try it.

On arriving there was a queue outside - fair enough, it's a popular restaurant and you expect this. I saw a waiter come out of the door to look at the line, and asked how long the wait would be for two people. He BARKED at me ""BACK OF THE LINE"" like I was a death row inmate.

When we did get inside, drinks were literally thrown onto the table, food order was taken and we settled down to enjoy dinner. The food I have to say was good, on par with any other good Chinese restaurant in town but what has let this place down is the breathtakingly rude attitude of the serving staff. The only person who seemed to care about the patrons was what I assume was the owner, slowly going from table to table, talking with the diners. Everyone else was rude, brusque and offensive.

I've read some of their responses to reviews over the last few months/years where service is criticised and it is clear they don't care to change, citing ""genuine Chinese restaurant"" experience. Guess what, you're charging a solid price for your food and experience and you're in San Francisco, you need to at least pretend you care about your patrons.

Be warned, food is good but expect service with a snarl.,Thanks for the feedback, Rob. We do promote an authentic Chinese experience, though we certainly don't intend to be rude. We've just found folks like to enjoy their food, so we don't want to intrude on a meal by being overly talkative or anything like that. I appreciate you leaving a review, and we'll use it to improve.

Sincerely,
Kathy, Manager"
"It was Great food but we were very rushed through the line. People were standing out the door and hovering over us for a table. It was clear the staff was rushing us to eat so they could seat the next person.,Sorry to hear you were bothered by the rush, Ben! We have a lot of customers daily, and so we do try to get everyone in an out in a timely manner. Thanks for your kind words on our food, and we hope we'll see you again soon!

"Sort of a whole in the wall but those are the best places.  Food was excellent and reasonably priced.,Don't sleep on us hole-in-the-walls! Thanks for the 4 stars, sounds like we really impressed you. Come back and see us again the next time you're in San Francisco!

'Til then,

"Not on Grant, just one block east on Kearny between Pacific and Jackson. Almost always a line, always a good sign! Have a Tsingtao with your meal!,Great advice on the Tsingtao, Donald!

"We were recommended this restaurant by the taxi driver as we arrived in San Francisco. As we walked in the rudest waiter was saying ""no"" even before we spoke. I asked if we could reserve a table for later and he said ""we don't reserve"" so I asked what time could we come back later as it's only 7pm, he waved us out and said ""no"" again. Extremely rude man! Very disappointing! Went to the China Town restaurant in Washington street and received great service and excellent food.,Apologies for any rudeness. It sounds like you caught us at an hour when we were closing. Either way, we should've been more clear and kind about our hours. I hope that the next time you're in San Francisco, you'll consider giving us another try.

Kathy, Manager"
"You don't go to the House of Nanking for atmosphere -- or maybe you do. The interior is warehouse-funky, the walls piled high with beer crates, the diners squeezed into side-by-side tables, long lines of hungry wait-listers lined up outside the door. The wait staff and cooks are Chinatown-brusque, and the din is non-stop. All of which you're willing to bear -- repeatedly -- for the best Chinese food in San Francisco, if not the entire West Coast. The dishes come out fast and piping-hot, and it's all delicious. Small wonder the House of Nanking has been until recently the best-kept secret in San Francisco, known primarily to locals aware that behind its unprepossessing -- make that vaguely threatening -- exterior lurks a culinary palace.,We love it when customers like you truly get us, Kirk! We're honored you think our dishes are the best on the West Coast. Thanks for the 4 stars -- we couldn't be happier to be the best-kept secret that finally got out!

See you soon,

"We went here for dinner tonight and it was one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to, and they custom make dishes if you want something that's not on their menu.,Thanks for the 5 stars!

"Arrived late into SF and had been recommended this place. Some reviews made us nervous, however we though we would try regardless. We ordered 2 appetisers and 3 mains between the 3 of us. Pork potstickers were good, chicken dumplings, personally didn't like the sauce. Mains were sesame chicken, beef crispy noodle tower and melting calamares. All good, though fried rice a bit steep compared to plain boiled. Would we go back?  Yes. Worth the 20 minute wait outside. It was mobbed, what better recommendation do you need!,Thanks for coming to see for yourself! Glad we could be a part of your visit to San Francisco. How about coming to see us again before you head back to the U.K.?

Hope to see you soon,
Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant has come so recommended to us from other friends in New jersey, We only have I night in san Francisco (this Sunday the 29) and really want to eat here. Any suggestions, Thanks, the reviews and staff sound amazing. How can we get through to them?????

"True to description about their Fried Calamari - they melt in your mouth.  We also had potstickers, fish with balsamic vinegrette, crispy rice noodle tower, and house fried rice. We ordered a second plate of their calamari at the end of the meal... it was really good.  Worth coming back for!!!,Sounds like our calamari was the star of the show! Glad to hear you had an awesome time with us. Thanks for taking the time to rave about our dishes here on TripAdvisor. Hope we'll see you again soon!

"We were visiting San Fran on our travels around the States and after having a drink in a bar we were advised by the bartender there to give Nanking a try.
We must have walked past it three times until we saw the multi-coloured sign! It's a small place with crates of beer piled up at the back infront of a busy steaming kitchen area! Aspects like that give this place its atmosphere.

We didnt really know what to order, so we asked for a recommendation telling them we liked chicken & beef. We got our food pretty quickly and it was absolutely fantastic food! One of the best dishes I have ever had! I couldnt even tell you what it was, we had one beef dish with green vegetables and one chicken dish with sweet potatoe I think it was...??

If I was ever back in America again I would come to San Fran JUST for this food!,We're as happy as you are that you finally found us, Laura! Thanks for the 5 stars. We love that you let us take care of you and order for you -- it's one of our favorite things to do! (I believe one of the dishes you had was our sesame chicken, by the way.) Don't hesitate to come see us the next time you're in San Francisco!

Thanks again,
Kathy, Manager"
"Would have been 1* except for the wonton soup which was good. Wait staff was rude and impatient. Obviously more concerned with getting everybody in line served so they could go home. Interrupted my wife- saying "" that is enough."" I didn't even get to select my entree. He was right- we didn't totally finish this poor to mediocre food. And this was after a >20 minute wait in line. Forgot my wife's tea and he was in such a hurry to close the tab, we didn't get to review the bill to see if we were charged. Seemed upset at his 15% gratuity. He should be glad my wife handles the money- I wouldn't have given him a fortune cookie.,I'm so sorry you mistook our service for rudeness. We're all about having the atmosphere of an authentic Chinese restaurant, so often times our service is rushed and to the point. Apologies if we upset you in any way. I'm disappointed you didn't enjoy your dishes, save for our wonton soup. Usually we get wonderful reviews on our food, so I'm a little disheartened to hear you weren't blown away. If you give us another try, you won't be disappointed. I promise!

"Went there at a friends suggestion.  It is not in the center of Chinatown but on the north eastern edge on Kearney St. The decor is a bit tired and the place needed a good cleaning.  The table behind ours had food spilled in the backs if the chairs which had not been wiped up and had hardened there.  The food was good an our waiter, a mature gentleman suggested that we ordering too much and might want to cut back a bit.  He was right and we appreciated it.  I think it is probably a very good neighborhood restaurant but I would not consider it to be a fine dining destination .,I'm sorry to hear we didn't leave a better impression on you, Warren! However, I appreciate you taking the time to provide this candid feedback. This is the kind of review that lets me know we can do better, and we will!

Thanks,
Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant is amazing! Go early because it is popular & they do not take reservations. Eating is communal, so be prepared to share a table with some strangers! The best bet is to ask the server to bring you the specials – you won’t be disappointed. The tea is a must – the tea blossoms as it steeps!,Thanks for stopping by to see what we're all about, and thanks for following up with such a delightful recommendation afterward! We're thrilled to have a new tea fan in you. Hope to have you back next time you're in SF!

"On our first trip to San Francisco, we ate at this little restaurant at the suggestion of a friend of ours. It is a perfect non-touristy place with the best Chinese food I've ever eaten!  We weren't sure what to order so asked the waiter to pick for us.  He brought out two dishes that were excellent choices.   I would go back to San Francisco just to eat their again!,Please be sure to thank your friend for recommending us -- we're happy to have you! I couldn't be happier to hear how much you love our dishes, and we're honored that you think our food is the best Chinese food you've ever had. We can't wait to see you on your next visit to SF!

"The food (sesame chicken and house noodles) are incredible. Yes, the staff is not the friendliest, but they were also not rude. I made conversation with the owner and told him that I saw him on tv and he warmed right up. Just go for the food. It was the best Chinese I've ever had. Seriously.,You get us! Thanks for your kind words on our dishes. You're right: It's all about the food! Hope we'll see you again soon.

"We have been going to the House of Nanking for over 20 years. During our recent visit to San Francisco we had lunch and dinner there. I was a little bit disappointed by the selection on the lunch menu, but wanted to give the restaurant a second chance and go for dinner. The menu was the same, but had a larger selection of appetizers. We had sesame chicken (which was the best dish recommended by the waitress) salt and pepper shrimp and mushrooms and a spicy eggplant dish. To be honest with you it was nothing to write home about. I think that we will give the House of Nanking one more try and if the service and quality of food has not improved we will not return.,Sorry to hear we disappointed you! We appreciate your support over the years and hope we'll have the chance to show you why you loved us in the first place. If there's something you used to enjoy in the past, feel free to ask us if we'll make it for you again.

Looking forward to impressing you next time!

"The food was fine, but it doesn't sit well when the staff is so rude. There was no line outside so we walked in. Instead of a sign that said please wait to be seated or please wait outside to be served, we walked in only to be shooed out hastily by a waitress with no explanation. She shut the door in my face with my 7month old baby in my hands. I didn't know what I had done wrong and went to walk away, only for her to come out and holler at me to come in because she had a table ready. I thought to myself that maybe I am just unfamiliar with some sort of custom and wanted to give the place a fair shot because of all of the rave reviews, so I sat down.

We asked for tea and were told no, (how do you not have green tea in Chinatown?), and then we asked for cokes....we were brought water with not one cube of ice or a refill. The waitstaff seemed annoyed that we weren't ready to order right away and needed a few minutes to navigate the menu.

When we went to leave the manager/owner gave us the check and and then stood over us until we signed the paper and left a tip. We left a mediocre tip for what I considered a less than mediocre service, but apparently it wasn't up to his standard because we were given glares, stares, and they spoke under their breath as we were leaving. 

I have never been treated so poorly at an establishment that I was helping to support. This is one of the few times I have felt let down by my Trip Advisor research.,I'm so sorry to hear that you feel our service was so disappointing. Our goal is never to be rude, rather we're to the point and a bit hurried -- much like an authentic Chinese restaurant, in fact. The trick with us is to just go with the flow! Hope you'll give us another chance.

Kathy, Manager"
"This restaurant was recommended to us by many people. However the experience was laughable as the staff are SO shockingly rude. The food wasn't even worth bearing the poor service for. Most certainly won't be going back! Some people need to be grateful for their custom. I don't know where all the good ratings come from as it seems we're not the only ones to experience the bad attitude!,It's a shame to hear you feel this way! As you can imagine, we're never ok with unhelpful or down right rude service. Along with that, I'm shocked you didn't enjoy the food more. Just know we're always open to feedback and if there's ever an issue with your meal, we're happy to listen. I hope you haven't lost all faith in us yet, I know we can really knock your socks off.

"It's different for sure ! The potstickers and calamari are a must try. Not fancy at all but the food is incredible and the price is very reasonable for San Francisco .,Thank you for singing our praises here on Tripadvisor, Wes! We appreciate all of your support. Hope to see you in again soon.

"When we asked a local for a great place to eat in Chinatown, he immediately steered us to House of Nanking -- and thank goodness! Folks were lined up to get in when we arrived, but our group of four only waited about 10 minutes for a table. People move in, people move out. The atmosphere is busy, energetic, loud -- and really fun! We were seated family-style next to another couple, and everyone seemed to be having a great time.

The salt and pepper shrimp were absolutely fantastic -- some of the best I've ever had. We ordered family-style, and the chicken dishes were also great. The food arrived piping hot and tasted incredibly fresh. We had a team of servers (and the owners, I'd imagine) seeing to our needs and, though it was occasionally tough to catch the eye of anyone for a drink refill (seriously, they move like lightning!), I have no real complaints. Awesome meal!,Thanks for the 5 stars! I'm ecstatic to hear how much you enjoyed your experience with us. Our atmosphere is unique -- that's for sure -- but I'm glad you enjoyed it. Appreciate your kind words on our dishes, and we're honored you found our salt and pepper shrimp to be some of the best you've ever had! Hope we'll see you again the next time you're in San Francisco!

"This restaurant isn't going to win any medals for health and safety excellence; with barrels of oil and crates of soft drinks pilled up in the walkways. A trip to the toilet where the light doesn't work may put the gourmet diner off their food. However, what this place delivers is authentic, flavorsome food in an environment that perfectly encapsulates the chaotic atmosphere of SF China Town.,So happy you enjoyed your experience with us, Matthew! Thanks for the 5 stars and kind words on our dishes.

"A friend learned we would be in SF and suggested we try this out because his experience, food wise, was spectacular. He was spot on. Place has little ambience but the quality of the food was outstanding. My wife had the Mongolian beef and I the scallops in ginger sauce. Both were excellent. Apps were wonderful.,We're so glad your friend suggested us, Mike! Thanks for following his suggestion and coming to see us. I'm glad to hear you and your wife had such a wonderful experience with us! Hope you'll come back and see us again the next time you're in San Francisco.

"We were tipped to this restaurant on the edge of Chinatown where tourists seldom visit and locals fill the place instead. We only waited a few minutes for a table in this Chinese restaurant version of a Seinfeld episode. You don't have a server, you have servers coming every direction serving all tables in this simple and crowded atmosphere. The work flow was a thing of beauty to watch. We ordered ""family style"" off a recommendation because it's cheaper with more food. And, the food was outstanding. We ate shrimp and two types of chicken. I give the place a 10.,Ten out of 5 stars? We'll take it! Thanks for taking the time to rave about us here on TripAdvisor. We love being enjoyed by everyone -- locals and tourists -- and I'm so happy you were able to swing by and see us. Don't forget to come back and visit the next time you're in San Francisco!

"Maybe it was because we visited at the wrong time of day (7:30 on a Wedneday night) or perhaps it's always this busy, but we had to wait almost half an hour to get a table, probably the first time I have had to wait to get a Chinese.

I will start by saying the food is really good; much better than the take aways I have a home. Well done to Feng for his cooking recipes!

Unfortunately, the service was not got at all. The lady who showed us to the table was very abrupt, and the owner (I presume) stood over you to make sure you left a tip, and we weren't going to leave one but felt pressured to do so. Finally, there was a $1.50 inclusion on the bill that we had no ideas was for, defiantly not tax as that was separate. Best pay it and leave and probably don't go back unless I see that the service improves.,A line outside our door isn't uncommon, but the trick is to catch us on our off hours. Happy to hear we wowed you with our dishes, though!

You're right about our service, it can be abrupt at times, but part of it has to do with the fact that we need to keep things moving so your wait time will be shorter.

Thanks for the review, and I hope we'll see you again.

"We were  8 family members from Southern California celebrating the college graduation of my  son.  My son was determined to make his family experienced the ""Best Chinese Food."" So we tried to make a reservation but to no avail. So at 4:30pm we were in file to enter this small temple of good tasteful chinese cuisine.  We waited for 20 minutes to be seated.  Lucky us!! By 5:00 a small crowd was piling up on the sidewalk  waiting  to be seated.  The polite owner of the restaurant took  good care of us.  He placed the order for us….and the good foods such as calamari,sesame chicken and crispy noodle tower with pork….starting to fly in  one by one  and the only thing we were able to say is ""wow""…""wow""..the best chinese food we've ever eaten..,Looks like you caught us at just the right time! I'm so happy to hear that you all had a wonderful visit with us. Please extend our congrats to your son for graduating and thank him for suggesting us as a location to celebrate.

"We had this restaurant recommended to is by various people, it was tough to find when your not used to the streets but we got there. 

The menu was nothing like we'd ever seen before but when the food came it was extremely tasty. We had to ask for drinks as only water was originally provided. 

The only area that gave me concern was paying with my card, It was the first time I'd used it on this stay. I'd decided to give a tip in cash so I signed the amount and then he gave me the cash back and altered the receipt instead!! This alarmed us as I am now panicking that this could be re altered to any amount they fancy... 

For peace of mind pay cash!,Apologies for the miscommunication regarding the check. Sounds like your server was a bit confused. Nonetheless, I'm so happy to hear you had a great experience with us!

"My brother-in-law recommended this place, and he is usually pretty good when it comes to tips so my husband and I obliged during our weekend stay in San Francisco.  Well,  we were not disappointed, in fact we returned two days later.  Order the House Noodles, pork dumplings, sesame chicken, and market greens stir-fried.  That is enough for three people, though I have to admit we cleaned the plates and there was only two of us.  It is small and crowded, service is straight-forward and fast. Don't go for the experience, go for the food, which is really tasty.  It is worth the visit in my book.,Please be sure to thank your brother-in-law for the recommendation, Riosal.

"Although the staff was kind of strange; they asked us outside with how many people we wanted to eat and then just close the door leaving us outside. They also decided that we could just order two mains with two persons as that was enough. We were not allowed to order any more food, which was funny but strange.

"They don't take reservations but we joined a queue for an early dinner and were told it was very busy, we decided to wait anyway and were surprised to be seated within a few minutes. Very comprehensive menu and we had trouble deciding. The waiter was really helpful. Deliciousness followed: course after course. The only warning is don't over order. Our waiter actually advised us not to order another dish as she said 'too much'. Compact tables make for conversation with fellow dinners and everyone else seemed happy with their choices too. We were out within the hour but loved the meal and would definitely head back if we had the chance.,Thanks for joining us for dinner!

"We had been here with another couple on an earlier trip to San Francisco and enjoyed ourselves tremendously.  Our friends ordered the exact same dish and were told by our server ""No - you can't order same dish.  You have different ones and share"", which they did.  They were very happy with whatever they were brought (not knowing for sure since the second dish was chosen by the server), and this time I ordered dumplings for an appetizer while my husband asked for an egg roll.  He was told ""No.  You share her dumplings.  She'll get too many.""  We weren't going to argue, knowing he was probably right.  He was.  Again, our food was delicious, hot and plentiful.  I think anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy this tiny hole in the wall on Kearny Street.... you will not be hungry when you leave!,Hunger and humor -- they go hand in hand when visiting us.

"This place seemed to have a good reputation for its food but a bad reputation for the service. We went to check it out. We ordered two lunch sets: salt & pepper mushroom and Nanking sesame chicken. They came with steam rice and cost about $20 with drinks and tip. The dishes were well done even compared to those we've tasted in Asia, and it was quite refined for its scale. We were really happy with the find, though in the end, the dishes seemed a bit too much and became monotonous. Probably went better if we go in a large group and share a few types.

The place itself had the old style China look, with wooden benches and tables and earthenware pots on wooden shelves. The owner hung his culinary cert on the wall with a photo of his younger self, along with news articles praising the restaurant. He actually went to fetch our order himself, but another lady delivered the food. It was no nonsense service without smiles, but quick and efficient. It appeared that we were the last customers accepted, because after we sat down, we saw few other people got refused into the restaurant. I wouldn't know that they're closed after 2.30 pm and those people seemed unpleasantly surprised too. It did give an impression that the opening hours could be rather random at times.

I'd go back for other items in the menu if I'm in the area, and pray that they decide to open it when I visit!,So happy to hear you decided to check us out for yourself! Thanks for the 5 stars.

"We were seated right away as it was early evening: we shared good appetizers and 2 entrees!
The room was buzzing and lively. The service was fast but special for it's lack of charm and engagement? We loved what we ordered and had more than enough to eat.
We hoped that our young intern grandson could take home the left overs but there may have been an exchange of smiles and a language barrier, so we left without!"
"It used to be so good, and now is so average.  Terrible service was always part of the ambience, but now the food is very average - mass produced, greasy, and dried-out rice to boot.  Value still ok, so not what I'd call a tourist trap.  Disappointing just because of how good the food used to be.,Disappointed to hear you think we're not as great as we used to be, Oliver.

"Every trip to San Francisco means a trip to House of Nanking. We had our first meal here over 20 years ago when it was just a few tables and a counter with stools. We consulted our book of things to do in San Francisco on our first trip and it said to eat Chinese at House of Nanking. Our first meal her was ordered for us by Peter the owner and it was then and has continued on every visit to exceed our expectations. The glazed sweet potatoes and the salt and pepper shrimp are awesome. The staff can sometimes seem a little disinterested but I chalk it up to the eating experience.

"We arrived at the restaurant and were barked at ""HOW MANY?"" regarding number of patrons in our party. Our menus were frisbee'd across the table at us. After looking at the menu, my partner had a query regarding one of the dishes and whether it was spicy or not. He simply asked ""Is this dish spicy?"" when the waiter replied with a very disgruntled and abrupt ""WHATT!?"" We were quite shocked and he re stated the question to which the waiter replied with ""NO SQUASH!"" prompting us to feel as if we were inconveniencing her and to hurry up and order. I then had a question to ask regarding the menu and politely asked a passing waiter who blatantly ignored me and walked straight past me. 
We ordered our drinks that were slid across the table at us. When we received the food, the dish in which we asked whether was spicy or not did include spice, definitely had significance spice in it. The service was appalling and the environment was not to be desired- slabs of soft drink and beer stacked in the walk ways.,Sounds like there was some serious confusion during your visit with us, Alysha. Please accept my apologies for that. Did you end up enjoying your dishes, despite the spice? I'd love to hear more about that. Thanks for sharing your experience, and I hope you'll give us another chance to wow you. I'm confident we can next time!

"Had lunch at the House of Nanking. It was not packed at around 12:45 on a Wednesday, but was busy. We had the crispy spare ribs, the white fish, chow mein, mongolian beef and their specialy chicken. the spare ribs were crispy on the outside and slightly salted. The beef was served in a bed of dry noodles and the chicken was sweet and slightly sour. Flavors were not that very strong, nor were mild. Service was pretty fast, getting our meal in less than 15 minutes. Good value at around $8 per dish.,Thanks for joining us for lunch!

"Although not the traditional dishes like Kung Pao etc., the food is good although do not expect spicy dishes.

He took back the menus and said ""let me surprise  you"". He brought out three dishes, fish soup, garlic beef, and shrimp and pork tofu. All I can say it was a treat to our Asian pallets. The soup was the best I've ever tasted & the beef and tofu dishes melted in your mouth.

"This is a pretty unassuming double-storefront in Chinatown. We went  on a Sunday night and took our place in line on the sidewalk, but ended up getting a table rather quickly. Once inside, the lack of atmosphere was made up for by the fun and different food. We had calamari (lightly fried) in lemon sauce, which appears on the menu as ""Happy in the Mouth"" -- and it was. It was crunchy, not greasy, and the lemon sauce was light and complimentary to the seafood. We also had Scallop towers which combined large scallops, stewed eggplant and some  finely chopped greens. Again, the sauce (a brown sauce this time) accentuated the food. Both were under $15 and came with rice. A glass of the house Chardonnay was crisp and thrifty ($3.95). The hot flowering tea was not your typical Chinese restaurant tea -- in fact  it is served in a  plastic  stein that held at least 24 if not 32 ounces. My wife ordered it and was surprised when it arrived at the table, but after a few sips decided it was relatively bland but yet still interesting.,Sounds like you two had quite the visit with us! A fun and different experience is exactly what we're going for. Glad you enjoyed your dishes – from the calamari to the scallop tower.

Very simple interior and limited menu, which is always nice. Both soup and calamari were very good, although not memorable.
At the time of my visit, just cash was accepted, no credit cards.,Thanks for giving us a try! We often have a line, but I'm happy you found a time that was slower to visit. I hope you'll come back and see us the next time you're in San Francisco!

"We used to love House of Nanking. Best scallion pancakes around back then. This time we actually paid for our unfinished meal and went down the street to eat. We ordered several dishes: Hot and sour soup, potstickers, a wheat noodle dish and calamari. Everything was uniformly awful! Greasy, flaccid calamari. Soggy noodles. The soup and potstickers were just weird! Service was also very strange, the food and drinks came immediately, however the waitress kept trying to put uneaten food on our plates so she could hurry the platters off the table. When we paid and left most of our meal uneaten nothing was asked or mentioned. It was a total waste of calories!,I'm sorry your experience with us was disappointing, especially since you've been a fan of us over the years.

"Just recommended this restaurant to yet another friend today and, for the first time, peaked at the reviews on Trip Advisor.  I'm shocked by all the negative service reports.  We had an amazing experience thanks to a friend who's a San Fran native (we're from Seattle - Go Hawks!).  Our SF friend told us to go to the House of Nanking and ""tell them you don't know what to order.""  He told us the waiter will respond 'I'll take care of you' and will begin to bring food.  Well my Trip Advisor friends, that is EXACTLY what happened when we ate there.  The only difference we experienced from the exchange our friend told us to expect was that the waiter asked us if we had any food allergies.  Then he brought one amazing dish after the other.  My wife is not a big red meat fan, so when the honey glazed beef arrived she picked at it hesitatingly.  After trying it she proclaimed it to be one of the best dishes she has ever eaten.  Please give this place a try, and please allow them to choose your food for you.  You might discover something new and exciting!,We're ecstatic you decided to take the advice of your friend (please thank him for us, by the way)! Sounds like he knows us very, very well.

"The House of Nanking has a good reputation and there are stories about queues running down the street. The restaurant also featured in a Jamie Oliver TV show. 

We visited on a Monday in November and were able to walk right in and find a table for five of us.

The place is quite small and isn’t posh. The owner approached us and said we could do away with the menus and he’d just feed us – we agreed.

I won’t pretend to be an expert on Chinese food, or detail all the dishes that arrived. But I can say that everything was delicious.

We had plenty of drinks, including a few bottles of wine, but the bill was pretty reasonable – less than $30 a head I think.

I’d recommend a visit.,You don't have to be an expert to know what good food tastes like! Thanks for taking the time to share your experience here on TripAdvisor. We're happy to serve all five of you.

Thanks again for the recommendation, and we hope to see you soon!

"Rude older lady who I assume must be the owner since she was going around ordering us around like a dictator. Food was okay, but not worth the lack of respect that is shown to their customers. Menus were basically thrown at the table, and we weren't allowed to question anything. Needless to say, we will not be returning and we will never recommend this place.,I'm so sorry our service came across as rude during your time with us. It's never our intention to make any of our guests feel disrespected.

"This was the first place we ate at during our stay in S.F. It is in a great location and easy enough to find. We did not book. When we arrived it was super busy with people queuing to get in which is always a good sign in  my opinion. Inside it is noisy and dark with basic tables and chairs. Everyone sits very close together  The menu is simple but the waiter dude made some recommendations which turned out to be good. We liked the food a lot, is was also pretty cheap. But if you like to eat in a calm orderly place with a nice ambience pick somewhere else. I liked the buzz.,You're right – we're not your average restaurant.

"This place is a joke and should be out of business. The lady who runs it is rude impolite and racist. Don' t ever go there. The site states it is open until 10 pm,  we got there at 9pm. and this lady asked us how many in a very rude way. After that when we were ordering she refused to tell us how many people the soup would  serve. We ordered and when the food came we figured that we need more food for our party of 4( me,my wife, 15 daughter and 9 son).when the waitress that brought the food (only nice person there), asked if we wanted anything else before the kitchen closed, I tried to order another dish and more rice, when the rude lady rushed from the door saying the kitchen was closed and forbidden us to order anything else in a very impolite way. It was before 9:30. The result of the evening was that we left the restaurant starving and with my kids crying. This rude lady by the way was all smile with the chinese people there, showing that besides rude and impolite, she was also a racist. The situation was so awkward that the waitress that brought the food felt embarassed and apologize to us for the old lady behaviour. By the way, there was nothing special about the food.It was the first time in my life that I didn t tip at all. Don t go there unless you want to be treated like garbage. I wish I could give 0 stars.,Sorry you didn't enjoy your time with us, Luiz. I can promise you that our guests come from all different backgrounds, and we appreciate each and every one of them. We take claims like this seriously and have no problem refuting them immediately. 

I apologize that you felt our service was disrespectful and rude. It's never our intention to make our guests feel uncomfortable. We're an authentic Chinese restaurant in the fact our service is quick, focused and to-the-point, and it seems like some things were lost in translation.

Sincerely,

"House of Nanking is a quirky but fun restaurant in Chinatown with excellent food.  The interior hasn't been updated in decades and there's canned food and beverages stacked against the wall.  No pretense of decor here.  Went with a group of four on a business dinner.  One of the group had been here several times and merely requested of the waitress the ""Bring food!"".  They inquired about any food allergies and then proceeded to bring dishes until we were satisfied.  Brought a range of dishes (meat, seafood, poultry, etc) along with ad libitum white rice.  All were fantastic.  Really worth a trip here.,""Bring food!"" – we like it. Sounds like one of your group members really has us figured out! Glad to hear you all enjoyed our dishes and had a fabulous experience with us. Hope you'll come back and see us again soon!

Until then,
Kathy, Manager"
"A friend recommended this place having been before and the advice is to arrive early, so we did.

We were quickly seated and noticed the photos of celebrities who had visited - including Jamie Oliver, so we had high hopes.

We ordered mainly seafood dishes and were warned to stop ordering by the waitress - which was good advice.  plate after plate of different dishes were brought out, each delicious.  Beautiful, tender calamari.  Salt and pepper squid.  Scallop towers - fantastic.  Satay chicken (a house special)

Add in a few beers each (3 of us) and yet a bill of only $80 - fantastic value.  

If you are in Chinatown, swerve the street touts trying to haul you into their restaurants - head for Nanking!!,Please be sure to thank your friend for the recommendation. Paul! Glad to hear you enjoyed your seafood and poultry dishes.Thanks for taking the time to write this review, and we appreciate you letting us take care of you. The next time you're in San Francisco we hope you'll come see us!

Thanks again,
Kathy, Manager"
"The only regret I have is that I couldn't eat anymore! The best Chinese food I'e tried. We share a few dishes, and they were all excellent,Rach, it was our pleasure to serve you the best Chinese food you've ever eaten! Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts about us here on TripAdvisor. Next time, be sure to bring your appetite so that you have no regrets!

Thanks again,

"The food at this restaurant is excellent and that is why I tolerate the hostile service.  We go to House of Nanking every time we visit San Francisco.  Last year I made the mistake of trying to send back tea and was the recipient of a tirade in Chinese for five minutes.  (They did not take the tea back.) This year, I must report what I encountered.  I was very cold and wanted no more than hot, spicy wor dumpling soup.  I ordered it and other items for my family.  Plate after plate started coming out, but no soup.  When I mentioned that we did not receive the soup, the waiter said I did not order it.  I said I did, he said I didn't.  Then I went to who seemed to be the boss and she said I did not order it.  She asked me if I still wanted it.  I said YES.  Another tirade in Chinese. Be prepared to suck it up.  We ordered the infamous Spicy Wor Dumpling soup, Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken, Melts In Your Mouth Fried Calamari, all of which were outstanding.    The Bao Bing Wrap came with dried out tortillas and was not that great.,Apologies for the confusion, Alison. Since you've been here quite a few times, you know all about our straightforward and to-the-point service. Still that's no excuse to argue with you about what you did or didn't order. I'm happy to hear that your family enjoyed your dishes, save for the Bao Bing Wrap. We hope to see you again the next time you're in San Francisco.

Thanks for sharing!

"It was great, not the typical Americanized Chinese food. It has some great soups and the sliced pork was great. But get there early. It filled up fast, and I got there when they opened.,Smart thinking to get here early, Amanda. Thanks for pointing out that we're not your typical Chinese food spot – we're proud to be unique and different. Come back and see us again the next time you're in San Francisco, OK?

"Come on, folks. You've read the reviews so you KNOW what to expect. I've been here before and I'm from NY so I know exactly what I'm getting into. Wanted the wife to experience first hand.

Only waited 7 minutes Dec 30th at 7pm so was very happy.

We were immediately scolded. ""You order too much food!"" - we laughed. Food came fast, it was decent (I've had better) and when the wife went to compliment the old witch, she just turned her head away.

Of course, never one to shy away, as we were leaving, I gave her a playful punch on the shoulder (just enough to have a little sting) and said ""thanks again"", to the reply was ""Oh, ya, ya ya!"" with a smile.

Love it here!,Glad to hear you appreciate our unique style and charm. Thanks for taking the time to write this review! We couldn't be happier that you and your wife decided to spend your almost-last day of 2013 with us. Sounds like her first time with us was a hilarious one. Hope to see you two in here again soon!

"This is one of those reviews that's a bit difficult. The House noddles and sesame chicken are phenomenal, and unlike any other Chinese food I've had. That said, the service is terrible. Once you're seated, it's kind of a fen for yourself kind of event. Waiter comes over...No hello, welcome, or anything. Just pulls out a pad with a smile-less face for your order. Want water? Might have to ask a half dozen times. Box for left overs? Might want to bring your own. Here's the thing, though...The food is SO good, that I overlook the attitudes and just enjoy the meal.,Thanks for this honest review! Looks like our house noodles and sesame chicken are what keep you coming back for more – glad to hear it! Please accept my apologies for service that comes across as terrible. Our intention is to provide the atmosphere of an authentic Chinese restaurant, not be rude. That said, we can stand to work on things like getting you water the first time you ask. Thanks again for your feedback, and we're looking forward to your next visit!

Until then,

"I have been to this restaurant twice and just love it, last time we had wonton soup, pan fried pot stickers, scallops with vegetables and fried noodles, everything was delicious and service was great, a very good option for people who like authentic Chinese kitchen!,Thanks for this fabulous review! Glad to hear both of your visits were successful and filled with delicious food. How about coming to see us again soon? Our pot stickers won't eat themselves!

"Tour guide recommended while taking a tour and there was a line outside.  After our tour there was still a line.  The lady would come out and ask how many?  We only had to wait about 10 minutes as they get you in and out.  The tables a jammed in tight.  We were given menus and the older man came and asked what we wanted.  When we told him we needed more time as it was our first time, he promptly took up our menus and asked how hungry we were.  We said very.  Then the food for 4 started coming... first fried pot stickers with a delicious sauce, then a soup that was served for you at the table and was really good, then a sesame chicken dish with fried sweet potatoes that was perfect texture and taste, then another dish that I couldn't tell you what it was but it was very flavorful, and finally a fish dish with spinach and a sauce that was lovely.  Everyone was happy and we sorta wished we had said very, very hungry so we could have had another appetizer or entree served to us.  It was a fun experience to see what they would bring next.  Everything was hot and delicious.  Paid less that $50 for 4 people and two sodas. My only complaint was the rice came a little after the first two entrees had been served rather than with them. If it is your first time, be sure to tell your waiter and just let them put food in front of you, you won't be disappointed.,Thanks for letting us take care of the four of you! It's one of the things that make us unique, and it's one of our favorite things to do. Sounds like from the potstickers to the fish, we chose the right dishes for you. Glad to hear you had an experience with us that was exciting and delicious.

Come back and see us the next time you're in San Francisco!

"A group of friends (5 of us) including one Chinese food non-believer visited the House of Nanking on a personal recommendation in November 2013. We were initially slowed down by the fairly short menu, but then the owner (maybe) asked if we had eaten there before, took the menus away and brought us a fabulous taster meal of about 5 or 6 courses. Every single one was delicious, fresh tasting and completely different from any Chinese food I have eaten in the UK. There was a huge mushroom to start, 2 types of dumpling, beef with peppers, chicken and prawn dishes and plenty of rice. It was so good we started to worry about the price but when the bill came we were charged about $20 a head including a beer each. Could not fault our Nanking experience!,Thanks for coming by to see us during your trip to San Francisco, HappyLTraveller! We're happy to hear your group's experience with us was a wonderful one. We love being able to take care of our guests by ordering for them and appreciate you allowing us to do so during your time with us. Our goal is to give our guests a unique experience, and it sounds like we did so for you!

Hope the next time you find yourself in San Francisco, you won't hesitate to stop by.

"When I go I usually order the pot stickers and the scallops. Great seafood over a eggplant. Can't ask for much more, and reasonable priced too.,Thanks for this wonderful review, Andres!

"One of my business associates brought me here talking it up the whole time. He was right about one thing, it was truly an experience beyond the food. The attitude was tied with the whole experience. I let them choose my food. I got fried calamari and house noodles. The calamari was the best I ever had. The noodles were tasty, but like lo Mein. Make sure you get the flowering tea, it was fun to watch come alive and was good too. You will surely get the experience of Chinatown here. Make sure you get there before 6 pm, if you don't want to wait in line. Two thumbs up for dinner..,We wish you had a third thumb! Thanks so much for coming in and giving us a try, and I'm very happy to hear that you enjoyed yourself. We hope you'll come in again soon for some more of that calamari!

"This place was clearly a happening place.  Big crowds with tons of food was the story on a Friday night.  We ordered the won ton soup which was outstanding, highlighted by the crispy rice!  The pork fried rice was excellent with huge pieces of pork. The chicken chow mein was good, but had an overwhelming smoke flavor.  Go here when in Chinatown!,Thank you for recommending us, and I'm very pleased to hear that you enjoyed your meal. We work hard to make our dishes delicious and unique, and I hope you'll come again someday so that we can attempt to perfect your experience. I'm certain we can do it!

"I have tried it because some recommendation,I was lost in China town looking for a restaurant and found it, and remembered the recommendation, doo I went for adventures! 
First adventure, you share the table with others guest, be ready for that and be open mind! 
I ordered home noodles with chicken, enough for once guy! And a beer, they served Tsingtao.

It was ok, sharing the table with more people, and food and service was ok,too fast that's why the title good&fast! 
I'll repeat, but please I'm not in a hurry I'm on holidays :-),Thanks for this 4-star review. I really think you've found the perfect way to describe eating with us: It's an adventure. Great advice to keep an open mind. Many people aren't used to sharing a table or having the chef order for them, but it's all about the experience.

"Pescatorians and vegetarians will be very happy with this find, but a place with two dishes that were meat based, we walked away disappointed.,Uh oh!

"We wanted a good Chinese whilst in San Francisco and we resorted to looking on trip advisor. And I'm glad we did. What a place this was!

As recommended on here we didn't order a dish just ordered something chicken and something prawn. What came out was just so flavoursome and immense that I can still taste it now!

Don't expect luxury or amazing service, just good honest proper Chinese food. Terrific!,Sounds like TripAdvisor didn't steer you wrong. Thanks for coming to see us during your visit to San Francisco. I'm especially glad you let us take care of you and didn't order a specific item on the menu. It's what we do best!

"The food here was excellent and the entire experience felt incredibly authentic.  The flavors in the won ton soup, fried rice and the lettuce wraps were excellent and fresher than your typical Americanized Chinese food.  The sesame chicken was crispy and delicious - not the overly-breaded, cornstarch and sugar laden stuff you usually see.  And the coolest part of the meal was the Blossoming Flower tea.  Served in a big glass mug, you watch the flower bloom and unravel as it sits.  The flavor was mild, which I also liked.  I don't know if I'll ever have an experience with Chinese food that is as good as this one!
Also the atmosphere made you feel like you were somewhere different.  Small, somewhat dark but with character.,Thanks for this wonderful 5-star review! We're happy you found us during your trip to San Francisco. I'm so glad to hear we made a non-Chinese food fan leave happy and full. Your menu recommendations are great – especially the Blossoming Flower Tea, sesame chicken and won ton soup.

"Two people who've visited San Fran recommended this restaurant.  Granted my experience of Chinese food is usually the typical semi-seedy take out or local chain dining.  However, two things about this place: flavor and local color.

Flavor: My party tried a chicken dish with sweet potatoes and a noodle dish which was garnished with bean sprouts.  I don't recall the actually names but I definitely recall not being able to stop eating the bean sprouts on the noodle dish.  The sauce that was used made me keep subconsciously eating it in the midst of conversation.  Then I realized - ""wait a minute, this is good!""  And, the sweet potato dish was delicious.  Why was the food so good? Besides having supernatural prowess in the kitchen - the food tasted fresh.  I actually tasted all of the greenness of the sprouts instead of having overcooked, soggy veggies drowning in sauce.  The sweet potatoes and sprouts tasted as they should and made a sweet melody with the sauce.  The sauce wasn't cloying.  It was just the right texture.  The noodles didn't clump.  They were light, and melted in my mouth. Amazing.  

And despite a wait on a Saturday night, and it being packed, the food came out fast. 

Local color:  My San Fran resident/friend warned me about one of the servers/owners there: ""Watch out for that lady.  If you take to long, she'll just order for you.""  That same woman ended up taking my order.  I could tell she was slightly annoyed when I changed my drink order, but I already knew she was no nonsense.  The staff was in a hurry, friendly, but clearly their priority was getting us to a table and getting you to your food.  I didn't feel rushed or as if the staff was rude.  Outside, we were divided by a waitress into two lines, couples and groups of three or more.  No name taking here, someone comes out, points to you, motions you in, and the adventure begins.

I highly recommend this place. I'm still thinking about those bean sprouts on the noodles and sweet potatoes.,Thanks for taking the time to write this wonderful detailed review. We couldn't be happier to hear the recommendation led you to what sounds like an amazing time. The fact that you appreciate both our food (especially the bean sprouts) and our atmosphere. We're not your average Chinese food restaurant, and I love that you went with the flow! Your recommendation means the world to us, and we're looking forward to your next visit.

Thanks again.

"Visited based on other good reviews and had a great evening.  Fun crowd and good service with excellent Chinese food.  Won-Ton soup broth was just excellent and the vegitable lettuce wraps were also very good.  All at a great price!  Oh, and ice cold Tsingtao beer!,Glad our reviews brought you to us, Tom! It sounds like you had a fantastic time with us during your visit to San Francisco. I'm pleased you enjoyed your Wonton Soup, lettuce wraps and beer. Thank you for mentioning our great service.

"Been twice with friends and just love this place. Known by the locals as ""the house"". You have to go family style and FORGET THE MENU, don't even look at it. Just tell them the types of food you like (for example: ""we like chicken, beef, seafood, and we'd like at least one veggie dish"", that sort of thing) and let the chef pick for you and make special dishes for you. Everything they bring out is AMAZING. I eat stuff here that I normally do not like because everything is just so dang good!! In fact, I'm not a big fan of Chinese food in general and yet the two dinners I've had here have been some of the best dinners I've ever had. Definitely recommend!!,This was such a fun review to read! You hit the nail on the head when you recommended future guests forget the menu. After only two visits, it's clear that you understand and appreciate what we do. Since you're not a big Chinese food fan, we especially appreciate you giving us a chance.

"Visited this restaurant after reading a recommendation in a guide book.  Not sure exactly what to expect. The set up could be described as 'rough and ready', not particularly pretty, with bar supplies piled up adjacent to our table. However the place was packed, even early in the evening. As we perused the menu, undecided, the restaurant owner quickly identified us as Brits and said not to worry as he would 'take care' of us.  We were slightly disconcerted by this, but didn't need to be, as we were soon devouring starters of Portabello mushrooms, fried peppers and calamari and then won ton soup, followed by sesame chicken with sweet potato, beef with pak choi and shrimp with apple.  All delicious and very much enjoyed. When all was eaten we were asked if we would like any more food, but we were all full. Ah - you say - but what about the bill?  Well, at $120 for 4 of us including 5 x drinks, we didn't feel that we had been 'had' by any means.  Yes, the pace is brisk here, but we didn't feel rushed.  This is a business with limited space that depends on bums on seats, so you cannot argue about the efficiency of the staff. The owner pointed out a picture of one of his previous customers, a Mr Jamie Oliver, on the wall.  Cheesy, but we would agree that this place is full of character and, indeed, 'pukka'!!,Sounds like we really did take care of you during your visit with us, Lindy87. Choosing a menu for our guests is what we do best, and I'm glad you all decided to go with it rather than resist. Thanks for taking the time to share your experience here on TripAdvisor.

"We were exploring Chinatown one day last week, and on the recommendation of our Sonoma tour guide Adam, from Green Dream Tours, we stopped at the House of Nanking for lunch.  I wasn't sure we were in the right place, it wasn't high on atmosphere, but we were seated immediately, and were soon poring over the menu.  The owner came by and asked if we'd ever been there and we said no.  He collected the menus after making sure we didn't have any allergies or religious restrictions with food, and we were treated to the best meal we've ever eaten in a Chinese restaurant. I only wish I had more room in my stomach, because after what we did sample, I wanted to try everything on the menu.  We will definitely come back next time we are in the city.,Looks like you have at least one excuse to come back to San Francisco – us! We're glad you took the advice of your tour guide and joined us for lunch. Ordering for our guests is one of the things we do best, so I'm happy you took advantage of that.

"I've had the Sesame Chicken twice now, and I would not recommend it.  It's tough and sticks in your teeth.  The salt and pepper shrimp is excellent.  I recommend ordering it instead. The House of Nanking is a standard Chinatown experience, and is dependable for good but not great Chinese food.  It's cheap and they only take cash, no credit card. Service is harried and could definitely be more helpful.,The salt and pepper shrimp is an excellent suggestion! Thanks for making it, HolyBattGirl.

The service - leaves something to be desired - you get a feeling they just want you to get on with it; if you do happen to hem and haw over the menu -  just leave it to them - the recommendations are good! All in all a clean restaurant - not too high on decor; worth the visit for the food!,Glad to hear you paid attention to the advice of other reviewers and came by.

"We already know what to expect here.  A great place to have Chinese food.  The other reviews are right in that the wait staff appears to be rude.  What they are is efficient and they like to keep things moving.  If you are hemming and hawing about what to get, they will not hesitate to suggest something to move you along.  

But at the same time I have never felt hurried and linger over my blossom tea as we take in the atmosphere.  But we don't come here for the ambiance.  We come for their pot stickers with that ""to die for"" peanut sauce or the house special, the crunchy Sesame Chicken.  If in doubt, get two orders of the pot stickers.  Yummy!,When it comes to our service and food, it sounds like you really understand us! Our goal is definitely not to be rude, but efficient as you've said.

"I went here because the high recommendations I received from friends and the internets.

The food was ok. The service - could have been better. I get it, its a place that gets inundated with tourist and that might be annoying to the staff - get over it. 

The place was clean and the bathroom had a heavy bleach smell - I recommend lunch here. It was fast and there was no wait. 

IF you are looking for a better chinatown experience- get Dim Sum somewhere else... this place is not a Dim Sum place.,We're disappointed you weren't wowed by your experience with us. We wish we had lived up to the recommendations of your friends and others. Please accept our apologies for a seemingly annoyed staff. I can promise you we weren't annoyed, but we can do better about not giving off that impression. 

What did you end up having to eat? Did you let our chef take care of you? We'd love more feedback on what you thought.

"Found this restaurant in one of those best places to eat in S.F. books.  We tried to get  in a couple of times, but we were too hungry to wait in the long lines. When we realized it's always like this, we waited. and it was worth it!  The hot and sour soup is the best we have EVER had!  We were going to look at the menu, but then someone came up to us and ended up choosing for us.  It was soooo, soooo good!  It's a very small restaurant, with tables crowded together.  If you're in a hurry to eat the best Chinese food in town and then run, this is the place for you.  If you want to eat the best Chinese food in town in a relaxed atmosphere, over leisurely conversation, wait until you're in a hurry. There are too many hungry people that they have to service, so they move you along quickly.  I highly recommend House of Nanking for the delicious food and great service!,We're glad your persistence paid off and you finally got to dine with us. We can be hurried and hectic at times, but when it comes to our food we don't mess around!

"We queued, despite having booked, on a Friday night, chatting to lovely locals who obviously make a regular habit of the House. Tiny and packed with chairs and tables squeezed into every corner and busy servers desperate to get you seated and fed - great if you want quick eats, not ideal if you want a relaxed or romantic evening. Sesame chicken was superb, house noodles a little bland and not a fan of the sauteed calamari (big chunks of bland, cheewy squid)...and 45 minutes later we were back out on the street!,You're right, Nic, we're not necessarily the best spot for a lengthy dinner. But then again we're not your average restaurant. Thanks for taking the time to write this review. We wish we could've wowed you during your time with us. Next time you're in San Francisco I hope you'll come visit us again. Since you'll have different expectations, I'm confident you'll have a wonderful experience.
 
Thanks again,

"Our tour guide told us about this place in China Town and we were so glad she did.  The owner came around and asked if we had any food restrictions, none of us did, so he promptly took back all our menus and that's when this most amazing dining experience started.  Appetizer was sauteed Portobello mushrooms followed by soup and egg rolls, not your typical egg rolls, these were stuffed with fish, so yummy!  We also had soup, beef with bok choy, and a most wonderful dish of shrimp and apples.  The Jasmin tea was also delicious and entertaining, you'll just have to order it to see what I'm talking about.,Thanks for letting us take care of you! We're so glad you took your tour guide's advice and came to see us and even happier you enjoyed all of your dishes. Appreciate you taking the time to write this review, and we hope we're on your ""must-visit list"" when you come back to San Francisco.

"Went here on recommendation of hotel desk receptionist. Took a cable care(great experience). Food was delicious! Atmosphere is hard to describe.....dark, crowded, very busy, people waiting in line to get in. Would def recommend and go again!,Birkie2, we're glad you followed your hotel's recommendation. It sounds like you had a great time. You're right. Our atmosphere is hard to describe, but it's probably unlike anything you're ever experienced! We're thrilled you enjoyed our dishes and look forward to seeing you again the next time you're in San Francisco.

Thanks for taking the time to write this review. We really appreciate it!

"This restaurant was recommended to us by one of the local vendors in China Town. Thankfully we got there early and didn't have to wait because by the time we left, the line was down the street. Crowded and buzzing, our food was served quickly. Our meal was delicious,  authentic and very tasty as well as reasonably priced. We were so impressed that we went back for dinner the next evening (with a reservation). I would definitely recommend you give this place a try when visiting SF. Little tip - you have to try the flowering blossom tea!,Thanks for this wonderful review, Nadia! We appreciate you taking the time to write it. Sounds like those local China Town vendors steered you in the right direction. We're glad you listened and are even happier you felt compelled to come back for dinner the next night.

Great suggestion with our flowering blossom tea! We hope to see you the next time you're in San Francisco.

"This place was recommended by our concierge at the hotel. We went on a Friday night and had a que. Rumour is thats the same every night. The wait was worth it, reasonably priced and ultra efficient service. Do not go here if you want to relax and take your time, your a ""cover"" and dont you forget it- but its almost humerous its so quick. 

You order and literally seconds later your drink arrives, and seconds later your food....you get the bill and go o your pocket for cash and the waiter is waiting before its out....im sure all the staff are magicians!

So in summary, hot, well presented, excellent food in an ultra-slick environment - now pay and go!

All that said - I would 100%  return if went back to SF,We are absolutely loving this review. Thanks for taking the time to share your experience. While we may or may not be magicians, we're glad you were impressed by our quick service and delicious food. Please, please, please some see us again the next time you're in San Francisco.

Thanks again for this great review!

"Great value, great food.  Service is pretty straight forward....you are there to eat, they are there to get you a seat and your food.  Enjoy everything, it's all great.  It gets crowded and a line forms, but be patient, it is worth the wait. Four adults ate for under $70.,We're happy you think we're worth the wait. Even better that you think we serve San Francisco's best Chinese food. What an honor! We're grateful for this 5-star review. Thanks for sharing.

See you again soon? We really hope so!

"Well what can I say - best chinese meal we have eaten - you have to wait a while for a table but the wait is certainly worth it.  It was buzzing the night we went.  Yes you are crammed in but it all adds to the fun.  We did get offered menus but the front of house came over asked if we had been there before, we said no and she asked if we had any nut allergies; we said no - she then took the menus back and said she'd look after us with a large number of taster plates - fish, chicken and pork dishes, couldn't tell you the names but everyone was just yummy. Would go back any time.  Bravo.,Thanks for this fabulous review. We're not your average restaurant, so we couldn't be happier that you had fun and went with the flow. We're honored to have served you the best Chinese meal you've ever had and are glad we were worth the wait. Please come back and see us the next time you're in San Francisco.

Thanks again,
Kathy, Manager"
"Loved eating at this restaurant. Food was delicious and service was very efficient. Make sure you ask the owner to suggest dishes that are ""off the menu""
Prices were very reasonable and the atmosphere is fantastic.,We love serving up delicious, mouthwatering plates as much as you love eating them! Thanks for your wonderful review. Other reviewers will surely appreciate your tip on our ""off menu"" items — we feel the best things in life are worth asking for! Hope you'll join us for another meal the next time you're in the area. 

All the best,

"we were here 10 years ago, and went there right away when we came to SF this time... the service is quite unconventional- fast and practical- the prices are really fair, and the food is just great! best chinese food ever!,Wow, thanks for this great review. Has it really been 10 years since you visited last? That's amazing. We're honored you remembered us on your most recent trip to San Francisco. We cannot get over the fact that you still think we have the best Chinese food after all this time. 

See you soon (sooner than 10 years, we hope!).

"The original dai pai dong (literally ""big license plate"") restaurants in Hong Kong are mostly outdoors, and serve basic dishes with a minimum of fuss. House of Nanking is a real restaurant, but it's in the same spirit. It's crowded, it seems chaotically busy, it's noisy. The best way to order is to not order: When the old guy (owner, but I'm just guessing) comes up to the table that is your final destination (you were moved once to accommodate a larger group), glance at the menu and say ""You pick."" In exchange for this show of trust, four or five dishes show up. We were able to identify most of them; all of them were very, very good. Haute Cuisine it's not, and service is brusque at best, but the food itself is prepared to a high standard, and the value is excellent. Name me another place in San Francisco where you can get a meal of this quality for two and the bill comes out to less than $50! Absolutely worth waiting in line for.,We're blown away by how well you get us. Thanks for taking the time to write this review. For us, it's all about the food and authentic Chinese restaurant experience. We couldn't be more pleased at your genuine appreciation of this and are honored you think we're worth the wait.

The next time you're in San Francisco, we hope you'll come see us.

Until then,

"Busy place on a weekday at lunch.  Rice is not included with the mea!l so expect to pay extra.  Sesame chicken was tender, but the sauce had an unusual flavor to it.  Hubby ordered bao bing wrap and said it was good.  Service was okay.  Apparently, they only take cash, as we and another table tried to use a credit card and were asked to pay cash instead.,We wish we couldn've blown you away during lunch with your husband. We're glad he at least enjoyed his meal. You're right: Rice isn't included and we are a cash-only establishment. So sorry for the confusion!

We'd love to have another chance to impress you. Maybe the next time you're in San Francisco we will. Thanks for taking the time to write this review. We appreciate the feedback.

"I agree with reviewer Lockie2000...9/14/2013.  This is an experience alright...a total chaotic atmosphere. After being seated at a table where two other diners were almost finished their dinner, our order was taken, drinks DROPPED down on the table and then 5 minutes later the waitress is back picking up our drinks, partically right out of our hands and telling us to move to another table......because this suited them better for squeezing in more people.   Rude waitress, rushed service, appetizer and dinner arrived at the same time.  No rice...you have to order(pay) seprately for rice but that wasn't stated when we intially ordered.  What they brought out as my dinner wasn't what I ordered but then again remember I wasn't sitting here when I ordered.  Waitress agueing with me that I'll like what she brought me.  Bill was slapped down on our table and we were rushed out the door. We weren't the only people made to move tables once seated and even once started eating.....small groups to large groups of 8 or more were moved around the resturant during their meal.  Oh and LOUD....don't do it.,I'm disappointed your time with us wasn't more enjoyable. It's not our intention to make you feel disrespected or rushed. We seek to give the experience of an authentic Chinese restaurant, and sometimes the best thing to do is just go with the flow. That doesn't excuse the fact that you got the wrong order. I hope you'll accept my apologies for that and your server's reaction. 

I'm curious as to whether you enjoyed your food. It doesn't seem like it saved your visit, but I'd love to know what you thought. 

Thank you for taking the time to write this review.

"Great food, great atmosphere. However very crowdy, it's still cosy. The service was okay, but nothing special. The food itself is Chinese with a modern twist, the flavors were super! Also, I really liked the cold fruit tea. Prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality. I would recommend it to everyone!,Timothy, thanks for taking the time to share your experience. Glad to hear you really enjoyed your food. Do you remember what you had? 

We couldn't be happier that you find our atmosphere cosy and can't help but smile at your eagerness to recommend us! Thanks again and we hope to see you again soon.

"Had a nice meal at House of Nanking which included fried peppers, potstickers, and sweet and spicy battered stir fried chicken. Everything was very good.  The restaurant didn't have much atmosphere and the tables were very close together - but I think that's part of what makes it ""special"".,Thanks for this review. Glad you enjoyed your meal. Your recommendations are great! Our tables are close together, but as you noted, it is something that makes us special and authentic.

"Be prepared to queue as a popular venue on the edge of Chinatown.Menu extensive.The onion tart gorgeous as was my fried tofu in black bean sauce.there is a buzzing atmosphere also.service is brisk,and not as intimidating as previous reviews suggested.Portions were generous so dont over- order!,Djhall1, thank you for taking the time to write this great review. I'm happy you enjoyed  your time with us — from the food to the atmosphere. You're right, there's no reason to be intimidated when you visit us. Just sit back, relax and let us take care of you.

"This was the best Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.  The owner/chef took our menus and said he'd take care of us.  He had the waiter bring us a variety of different dishes and everything was awesome!,Wow, we're honored to be your favorite Chinese restaurant. Sounds like we really did take care of you all.

"I've eaten in many Chinese restaurants and I couldn't believe how wonderful the food was here.  My lunch-mate has traveled to Hong Kong and she agreed that this was the best Chinese food she has ever eaten also.  The decor was unique for this type of restaurant and very attractive.  We started by sharing the steamed vegetable dumplings, which had very fresh and light skins and was filled with large pieces of vegetables.  Then we ordered the onion pancake, by far the most amazing Chinese pancake ever!!  The pancake itself was light and crispy, and the filling was stuffed with mounds of lightly sauted green scallions.  Both dishes were sauced to perfection. Finally we shared the salt and pepper shrimp.  It was well seasoned but the best part were the mushrooms.  they were juicy and so flavorful.  We had the Chinese beer and it complimented the wonderful food.,GaiaSanFrancisco, thanks for this fabulous review. We're honored to have served you and your friend the best Chinese food you've ever eaten. Sounds like you had a great meal — all are great choices, especially the onion pancakes. We hope to see you again soon!

"I had been told to expect a lot and wasn't disappointed.  We arrived around 9.00pm on a Sunday night and there was queue of more than a dozen people but we persevered and it was well worth it.  The food is superb and the great thing it was reasonably price.  Four of us ate for about $50 a head for more food than we really should have eaten.

I wouldn't hesitate this restaurant.,RobNZ, we're glad to have lived up to the expectations set for you. Thanks for waiting in line to dine with us. Sounds like it was worth it! We're happy you enjoyed your food and hope to see you again the next time you're in San Francisco.

"After seeing this restaurant reviewed on TV, we thought we'd give it a try. Have to say if you don't pick from the menu quickly, you will have their choice of dinner served to you. It was an interesting concept, however, the chicken was on the dry side and the beef was not very appetizing. The unusual appetizer and soup were good.,NanaRandi, so happy you gave us a try! We like to think of ordering for you as a unique aspect and not a threat. Nonetheless, you're right, it's an interesting concept that we love. While we're disappointed you didn't enjoy your chicken or beef, we're glad you enjoyed your appetizer and soup. I will bring your feedback on your meal to the chef. We hope you'll give us another chance to impress you the next time you're in San Francisco. Thanks for taking the time to write this review.

"This is an experience alright. Don't mind waiting outside, didn't mind being seated communally (which is interesting but not everyones cup of tea) and i don't mind the chaotic atmosphere, it's the service where this place falls flat. It seems to be a theme among many of the other reviews and the replies from the managers to the reviews say they will strive to fix it but that doesnt seem to be the case on the ground. It wasnt just us who experienced it either, so did everyone at our community table. Rude waitress, rushed service, food arrives at random times, plates stack up on your table, you have to almost tackle a server to order more drinks, rice sat at a counter behind us for ages and only out on our table after we had finished our mains (sans rice). Not offered dessert but on the last bite of our food  bill was slapped down on our table and we were rushed out the door. I witness other tables who asked questions about the menu get treated with rolled eyes and a waitress walked away mid-sentence. Food was decent and we would have ordered more (wanted to try the tea) but we weren't really given the oppertunity. Not worth the effort and have been told there were better options.,Lockie2000, we appreciate you taking the time to write this review. I'm disappointed you weren't more impressed with us during your meal. We do want you to have a memorable experience with us, and it seems we at least achieved that. 

I'm glad you've noted that the atmosphere is a bit chaotic. You mentioned waiting in line and sitting communally, too. These are aspects that coupled with the service create the environment of an authentic Chinese restaurant. We have a lot going on and work hard to manage everything. When our service crosses the line and is interpreted as rude, that's when we really have to step back and evaluate. So I can tell you that we are paying attention to the reviews and are looking into ways to address all comments and concerns. 

I'm sorry that despite enjoying our food, you weren't able to order more. That's neither fair to you nor to us. I hope that the next time you're in San Francisco, you'll give us another try.

"If you hesitate a second when the waiter comes by to order your dinner a ""manager"" comes by and orders for you  touting an exceptional experience, t seems most every  had the same food, none of it exceptional . You are rushed to eat and leave . Their special dish of sesame chicken was hard and overcooked.,Sandybeachdeb, so sorry to hear you didn't enjoy your time with us. We do want everyone to have an exceptional experience and are disappointed it didn't happen for you this time. We like to think ordering for you is a fun way to change things up. Usually we are on point with our suggestions, so it's too bad to learn the sesame chicken was not to your liking. We appreciate your feedback and hope to have another chance to give you that ""exceptional experience"" we owe you.

"I go to House of Nanking every time I get to San Fran. First time was in 1996. It is a lot nicer than it was back then but still a hole in the wall kind of place with excellent food and terrible service. I go there for the tasty food and the comical service - often bringing you the wrong dish, sometimes taking 2 minutes to get your food, sometimes 20 minutes. 

A few suggestions - if you have company, make sure that everybody eats as soon as they get their food. Otherwise some will have to wait with their food getting colder. Best is to do what the chinese do - share. This way whatever food gets to the table, everybody enjoys.

Another suggestion - get the tea. 

Finally - some of the waiters and the owner like recommending dishes. You can trust them but if you see in the menu something you really want to check out - ask for it and be assertive about it... My experience is that everything is tasty.,Dan, thanks for sharing. You totally get us. Every visit may not be exactly the same, but we're glad you come back every time you're in San Francisco. Your suggestion about sharing dishes is great and we think it's excellent advice to those visiting us for the first time. We'll see you the next time you're in the city! Looking forward to it.

"We came by recommendation of locals. We were seated immediately, and the atmosphere was nice. Ordered our food, mine came very quickly but my husband's came 20 minutes later, letting my food just sit there and get cold. Was a little annoyed but the food was absolutely delicious. 10 minutes after that, when we were about finished with our meal the rice came. A little more annoyed, we weren't able to enjoy the $9(yes, beware.. Expensive, but enough for 2-4 people) fried rice. 

Servers are very quick to do business with you but it wasn't a big bother to us.

Even though the timing of our food was absolutely horrible- it was the best Chinese we have ever had so we would recommend going and would go back ourselves.

I had sesame chicken and my husband had this noodle tower dish that was to die for!,Gapeaches131, looks like the locals got it right! Glad they helped you find us. I'm disappointed that the timing of your food was not on point. This is something we can work on as we continue to improve. Thanks for your feedback on this issue. 

We're ecstatic that the quality of our food overshadowed the timing issue and appreciate your wonderful comments about your meal. I'll be sure to let the staff know our food is the best Chinese food you and your husband have ever had.

We hope you'll come and see us again the next time you're in the city!

"On my first trip to this restaurant, the owner came up to my table and took the menus from us and said that he would take care of us.  He did.  The Won Ton Soup had a thin cream broth, plump pork wontons and crispy rice.  It was great.  For entrees, we had Sesame Chicken and Honey Shrimp.  Both were outstanding.  Service was quick and efficient.  Highly recommend this place.,Thanks for the recommendation, glad we could make your visit with us a great one! Wonton Soup, Sesame Chicken, Honey Shrimp — it definitely sounds like you guys were taken care of! Having our owner or someone from our staff order for you is the best way to go. We're happy you were able to experience that. Hope to see you again the next time you're in San Francisco!

"What can we say, it came recommended.... But we won't be fooling others. 
The service was comical. Our waitress appeared at our table and TOLD us we were ready to order. A friend had recommended that we let the waitress make recommendations. But she wasn't even interested in answering our questions. Our query about a dish being vegetarian was greeted with a look out the window and the taking of the menu. She assumed that because we asked about a dish that was the one we were going to have, regardless of it being vegetarian or not! Our second order was taken with dictator like indifference and when our ""lets see what the waitress recommends"" 3 party when to order, she ignored him, took his menu and went to leave the table without taking his order. We had to practically call her back to place his dish request. 
We assumed that this type of rude service was going to be cancelled out by amazing food, but it totally wasn't! It was RUBBISH. Totally not impressed with overly sweet rubbery chicken dish  and a vegetarian dish with canned pineapple and frozen peas. Absolute disappointment across the board. 
Waste of a rare meal out!,When you're disappointed, so are we. Our service is unlike most restaurants as we are trying to give our diners the environment of an authentic Chinese restaurant. That said, we absolutely do not want our service to come across as rude or disrespectful. I hope that since we were recommended by a friend you'll give us another chance to impress you. I promise we can do better across the board to give you a wonderful experience.

"Went on recommendation of cab driver.

Expect to wait in line at busy times and then be seated with others.  Expect the wait staff to be short with you and tell you what to order.  Just go with it.  It all makes the experience a little more fun.

Food was pretty good, but not excellent.  My wife thought it was top notch food.

I would recommend and visit again.,Glad you and your wife took the advice of your cab driver and gave us a try. We like to be as authentic as possible, so we're happy you decided to go with it when it came to the service. It's all a part of the experience! Do you remember what you ended up having to eat? We'd love your feedback as we continue to improve.

Thanks for this review. We look forward to seeing you the next time you are in San Francisco!

"We were offered a table straight away. We had arrived at about noon. Service is functional. No chit chat. However the food was so tasty. My children aged 15.12 and 5 were adamant they wouldn't like anything, but everything we chose was loved. The sesame chicken was the favourite and we ordered a second dish.
I would go here every time I visit San Francisco and would be happy to queue if need be!,Caroline, glad your family enjoyed visiting us during your stay in San Francisco. We are so pleased you enjoyed your meals. Impressing children is tough — we're happy we passed the test. 

Hope you'll come back and see us soon. Our sesame chicken is waiting for you!

Until then,

"I would hazard a guess that most reviewers of this place are used to western chinese food. Nothing we ate was particularly authentic, in fact the chefs special that most people were ordering was just sweet and sour chicken. I did have a nice scallop dish with ginger and garlic, this saved me from scoring it a 2. The pot stickers were deep fried and lacked any flavour. I've eaten at better Chinese restaurants practically everywhere else in the world i've travelled. Seems like a tourist Chinese to me.,While I appreciate you taking the time to review us, I'm disappointed you found our food just average. All of our recipes are based on our experiences and they evolve; they aren't necessarily based on traditional recipes. That said, I'm pleased you at least enjoyed your scallop dish, and I hope you'll give us another try the next time you're in San Francisco. We'd love to have another chance to impress you.

"I live in a city that doesn't do Chinese food well. So, whenever I travel to San Francisco, this is always my first meal in the city. It's been my tradition for years.

The restaurant has doubled in size since I first visited it years ago, but it is packed every night and you will always stand in line outside. You will probably sit at a table with strangers, elbow to elbow. You will probably be told what you're going to eat by the owner and it's probably not going to be what you thought you wanted to order. Just go with it.

The best way to experience House of Nanking is this way. Once you're seated (really, the wait is never long, even on the busiest nights, I've never waited more than 15 minutes), order as follows:

1) Tsingtao
2) Onion cake
3) Tell them your favorite protein and let them decide on the details of the dish (ie, say ""I'd something chicken"" or ""I'd like something vegetarian, but no tofu."")

I have never been disappointed using this method, especially when ordering vegetarian.

I am reminded of a moment years ago while I was standing in line. I elderly couple from the east coast were looking for a Chinese eatery and stood looking in at House of Nanking. The line was bothering the husband, but the wife had a sense that this must be good place if it was so packed with a line out the door. Finally, she walked up to me, of all people, and asked ""Is it really worth the wait?"". I said, ""Absolutely."" Despite my assurance, she wasn't able to convince her husband. He asked me if there was another good Chinese place nearby. I knew of another one that was pretty good and I sent them there, thinking all the while that in the time they walked uphill and two blocks over to a ""pretty good"" Chinese spot they'd have a table in House of Nanking. I felt sad for them because I knew they'd probably never get another chance to eat at this unique restaurant and mad at myself for not trying to convince the husband to stand in line and wait for it.,Thanks for taking the time to write this review. You definitely have us figured out, even down to how to order. Individuals reading this before they come see us will be grateful they did. I think that you've nailed the experience in four words: ""Just go with it."" We're different than other Chinese food restaurants. Once you accept that, you're going to have a wonderful experience. 

We absolutely love that we're your first stop when you visit San Francisco. What an honor!

Looking forward to seeing you next time you're in the city.

Thanks again,

"This was recommended by our tour director and took 3 attempts to get in - it's popular!

Just outside of Chinatown so well worth the diversion. Food is excellent and very well priced so it's understandable why this is always full.,So glad you kept trying!

"Got the name from a little travel book on SF.  Great decor, real buzz, had to queue but for only 20 minutes on a Monday night.  Food fantastic and very reasonably priced.  A must to go to in SF.  It is not like normal Chinese which is either too bland, too salty or too oily but just right 10/10.,Glad you enjoyed your time with us. Thanks for the review! We're honored you consider us the best Chinese food you've ever had. What did you end up having that was so fantastic? Needless to say, we're ecstatic your SF travel book led you to us.

"My title for the review tells all. Food tastes great but the service lacks to say mildly. Nothing nice can be said from the door wait for a table treatment to how you are treated inside. We were 7 on the table and 3 times owner tried to seat a stranger on table. Got even more funny when my daughter went bathroom and 2 strangers started to take her seat. No respect. Food was good though just guard your seats.,I'm so glad you all enjoyed the food. Unfortunately, it sounds like your family didn't enjoy your entire experience with us. I would really appreciate if you could tell me more about the customer service. With more detailed feedback, I'll be able to better address the situation with our staff. Often times, we'll sit diners in open seats. So sitting with strangers isn't too rare and adds to the authenticity of the experience we're hoping to give. That said, I apologize for the confusion and especially the fact that an empty seat was considered fair game when it wasn't. I hope that you'll come back and see us when you all are back in town.

"This very informal and laid back Chinese is in an excellent area in SFO. Walking distance from Union Square. No reseravations possible and sometimes a line outside - its worth waiting as food is delicious. Quick service. Buy a cool t-shirt when you leave!,HerrEgg, thanks for the great review. I'm glad you took note about our informal and laid-back environment! We love being able to give our guests an authentic Chinese restaurant experience. So happy you consider our food worth the wait.

"I was here at the 14th of August 2013 with my family. We ordered the Calamari, escalope tower and Sesam Chicken with a side dish. I was surprised about the winning 2013 logo on the door. The food tasted horrible. All meals were fried so the taste was gone. Also the service was way back from pleasant and all the meals game after eachother.
I told the serveant I would write a negative review. All sge answered was ""I don'n mind"".
Surely I do not recoomend this restaurant. Maybe it was good in the early days but now it is to busy for them to deliver quality.,I'm sorry you and your family were disappointed with your dining experience with us. I will talk to the chef about your feelings on the food being overcooked and tasteless. I also apologize about the impression that we don't care about negative reviews. The truth is, we do care and we want every customer to leave happy. 

Thanks for your feedback, and I hope that you and your family will give us another chance the next time you're in the area.

"Our concierge recommended this restaurant. The queue to enter moved fast and we only waited about 5 minutes.  The lady server was very quick and abrupt and tried to encourage us to order her recommended choices. We decided on three of hers and another two from the menu. Part of the meal came very fast and the rest was delayed. When we enquired when our rice and our other dishes (including a starter) would arrive we were rudely shouted at. The food tasted very nice although the starter never did arrive. The service was awful. We paid the bill by credit card. Before we could even decide what to do about a cash tip one of the servers came over and angrily asked for a tip. Needless to say none was then left.,I apologize for your disappointing time with us. Our goal is to give an authentic experience with great food and service. Unfortunately, it seems that the service marred what could've been a good visit. Thank you for your feedback, I will be sure to speak with the team and remind them of how important it is to treat our customers with kindness and respect. I hope you'll give us another try the next time you're in San Francisco.

Thanks again for taking the time to write this review.

"We walked from the Mark Hopkins to Chinatown in search of my favorite restaurant-House of Nanking. Every visit provides another reason why I will make every effort to get here while in San Fran. We always have the waiter or chef pick out our dishes for us and have never been disappointed. Service is wonderful, pacing appropriate and the freshest, tastiest entrees anywhere. I have no idea what we had because it wasn't on the menu, but a seafood starter, beef course and finished with sesame chicken. Flower tea is always must for the cool days in SFO. We ate out a lot, but honestly, I could've eaten here every day.,Karen, thanks for taking the time to write this review. We're so glad to be your favorite spot to go to when you're in the city! The fact that you say you could've eaten here every day is the ultimate compliment. I'll pass this along to the staff and chef, who will be pleased to know you've never been disappointed with his choices. Please come back and see us again soon.

Until then,
Kathy, Manager"
"Our concierge recommended this restaurant. Great tastes. Simple interior. Really, really great food! We had the scallop tower - wow!,It's great to know you were pleased with your experience. I am so glad you enjoyed our food, especially the scallop tower! Next time you guys are in town, I hope you won't hesitate to come back and see us.

"For 30 years or more, this local favorite sports fantastic service in a cramped, busy atmosphere and serves quickly-prepped food with a limited beer/wine menu. Lines are often and the wait is long. Unfortunately, my critique will go no further than that. After finishing the meal, my mouth experienced the numb feeling of msg. If you wish to visit this place, call first and ask if that additive is used by the restaurant.,Bill, thanks for taking the time to write this. We are happy that you have great things to say about our service and atmosphere. I'm sorry to learn about what happened after you finished your meal. We do use MSG in certain sauces, but if you let the chef know ahead of time we can make your next meal completely MSG-free. The other thing that could have happened is that you had a dish that had Szechuan peppercorn in it. The spice has been known to cause a numbness or tingling sensation!

We're glad you ate with us, and would love to have you back for a meal that is more to your liking.

Thanks again,
Kathy, Manager"
"My wife and I enjoyed lunch with her husband and sister here after a long flight.  The wait was barely five minutes and the food was great.   The sesame chicken was my favorite.  We also enjoyed their house rice dish, crispy noodles, garlic fish, and pork potstickers.  If you're in Chinatown, I would definitely stop by.,I'm glad the four of you enjoyed having lunch with us! You've made some great recommendations — sesame chicken is definitely a fan favorite. Hope the next time you all are in San Francisco you'll come by and eat with us again.

"Stopped here with a few friends and we sat in the somewhat small, cramped dining area and ordered our meals. We got a few dishes with chicken and one with pork, which are served in LARGE dishes, big enough to share and plenty of food for three people. It was decently priced, but the food was outstanding. I would love to revisit and have their meals again!,So glad you enjoyed your time with us. We're small, but we're proud to offer both authentic food and an authentic experience. I'll be sure to pass along your feedback on the food to our chef.

Thank you for choosing to eat with us during your time in San Francisco, and I hope you'll visit us again. Next time, I'd recommend having our chef order different items for you and your friends to share. We love that our large dishes can be shared with friends.

Thanks for taking the time to write this review.

See you soon,

"This is a great restaurant in Chinatown, busy at lunch with locals, businessmen and tourists.  When I told the owner I had heard about a dish that wasn't on the menu, he asked if he could order for our table.  We agreed, and we were treated to 6 small courses, each of which was a gem.   Two appetizers, soup, and two entrees.  Fantastic shrimp, dumplings, and potstickers.  Bring cash, no credit cards.,Thanks for taking the time to write a review. Glad you could experience having your food ordered for you — it's something we love to do. And it looks like he got your order right! 

Hope to see you again next time you're in town.

"This restaurant was mentioned to us by a fellow passenger on a cable car. The outside is non-descript and in somewhat of a small storefront. We were seated and before could finish looking at the menu, an older Chinese man appears at our table and starts to take our menus while asking if we have any allergies, what foods do we like/dislike and tells us that he will make a fantastic meal for us since he is the owner. He wasn't offering this to all guests so, OK we're game but feel like even if we said no he still would go ahead and do it. Anyway, out come several platters, timed so that when we finish one the next one appears. The dishes were sweet crispy shrimp with apple? chunks (not a fan of this dish), a beef cooked so tender with bok choy that was delish, wonton soup that was outstanding (could do without the chili oil), spring rolls with a brown sauce - no cabbage etc.inside only meat (did not like them at all), lo mein with the ""works"".  It was a filling meal to be shared among the 3 of us but portioned so there were no leftovers. Overall, the dishes tended to have a certain spiciness but this was the real thing and not the ""American"" Chinese food we were used to. However, we decided if we ever returned,  would politely tell the owner we would prefer to order off the menu.,I appreciate you taking the time to write this review. We're happy you were able to visit us during your time in San Francisco. Having the chef create your menu for you is one of the highlights of our restaurant. I'm glad you got to experience it, even if you weren't a fan of every dish. (That feedback will go to the kitchen.) We take pride in being able to provide an authentic Chinese restaurant experience and it looks like that's what we did for you!

Please visit us again next time you're in the city!

"We stopped by cause of the reviews and the long line of people. They saytus in the same table with a French couple we did not know.  Once another table cleared, we moved.  Our order was taken quickly and the food brought out just as fast.  My husband got the wrong order but because he was hungry and adventurous, he just went with it. food was tasty and delicious.  Best we've had in San Francisco so far.....,Glad that paying attention to the reviews and long line outside our door didn't steer you wrong! Thank you for taking the time to write a review, and we're really excited you called our food the best in San Francisco so far. Hope to see you and your husband again soon!

"This is our 3rd time to NanKing and we continue to love the food. It's not the prettiest restaurant in the world and the service is the typical ""chinese"" so-so service where the food comes out as it's made in the kitchen, no fan-fare. We basically, just point at the dishes on the menu the chicken, the beef and the fried rice and it's all delicious. I'm not a huge vegetable lover but at NanKing, the entire plate of food including the vegetables are devour-worthy!

Table seating is first come-first served and a little crowded but well-worth the ""inconvenience."",Martica, we're so glad you keep coming back! Thank you for taking the time to reach out on TripAdvisor. Looking forward to your fourth visit with us!

"The waiter chose the food. Best calamari ever. Ribs and bock choi ""lovely"". Sesame chicken. Prawns and apple. Pork dumplings and black bean sauce. Fish was good. A full restaurant on the early afternoon when every other restaurant empty. A sure sign of a winner. All on 35 minutes. Don't miss it when in San Francisco.,Thanks so much for reaching out to us on Tripadvisor. I am so pleased to hear you enjoyed your meal with us, and that the waiter chose dishes you loved. The calamari is a personal favorite of mine! We appreciate your recommendation and I look forward to seeing you again soon.

Take care,

"We were in town for a family getaway and had this restaurant recommended to us.  Since this was our first time, the waitress recommended a sampling of dishes and they were all fantastic.  I don't often eat Chinese, becuase I find many of my local restaurants use too much grease in thier food.  All of this food tased fresh and delicious (the shrimp in a garlic sauce was amazing).  Some of the sauces and dishes were different from any of the others I have tried.   I will definately be eating here again when I return to the bay area.,We work very hard to make some of the most authentic Chinese food in San Francisco, so it's great to hear that you think we're doing a good job! Thank you for taking the time to give us some feedback here on TripAdvisor. Next time you're visiting the Bay Area, stop on in.

"My family and I recently ate at the House of Nanking while visiting SF on vacation.  It was highly recommend by my sister-in-law.  We hit it at a good time in the early afternoon since there was no wait.  The place is small and crowded.  Tables are close together so if you are looking for a romantic, quiet getaway with your significant other, this is not the place.  When we showed up, the ""hostess"" was quite short with us and to the point.  She pointed to the table and we sat.  No hi, how you doing or anything like that.  It is obvious they want to turn the tables as quickly as possible at this place, just like all the other popular venues in SF.  While the service was not the best, the food is definitely worth the trip.  We had the lettuce wrap appetizer to start with.  Very good and nothing like what they have at PF Changs.  Our entree's were all very good.  Three of us had the seasame chicken and I had a ginger chicken dish.  Again food was hot and good.  Quick to come out of the tiny kitchen as well.  Overall, I would recommend this to others but just don't expect to be treated like somone special.  You are just another tourist that they want you in and out as quickly as possible.,We're so happy to hear that you were able to try some authentic Chinese food while you were in the Bay Area! As you noticed, we can get extremely busy, but that's not an excise for one of our employees to be short with you. I plan to bring up your review at our next staff meeting, so that everyone remembers to be polite and welcoming. I hope you come visit us again on your next trip to the Bay Area. 

Cheers,
Kathy, Manager"
"I ate here twice on my trip to San Francisco. The food is fantastic, I had the sesame chicken twice and it's probably the best sesame chicken I've had in my life. You get a huge portion which is more than sufficient for one person, rice is next to nothing, alcohol is good value, for taste and price you can't beat this place! Service is very quick, food was piping hot, there's very little to fault this place. Service is unfriendly, but for the quality and quickness of service you can't complain.,William, thanks for sharing! We appreciate the compliments and hope to see you again if you're ever back in SF! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"We were told to be sure to go to House of Nanking for dinner in Chinatown.  Don't be expecting service.  The server immediately gave us the family style meal because we were first timers, when we really wanted to order our own meals.  The food was very good. It is noisy and small and you may sit with other customers. Very reasonable wine prices.,jlcintexas, thank you for the compliments! Glad you loved the food and wine prices. I hope you'll come see us again if you're ever back in SF! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"My friend said we may have to wait for a table at this place, but that it was worth it.  She was right.  We had a party of 6, and once we were in, the staff took really great care of us despite how busy they were.  Since none of us had been before, our waitress asked if we had any food allergies, and then said she would take care of us.  She brought out at least 7-8 of their dishes which were all good.  The crispy beef was my favorite, but it's hard to pick after that.  If you have the time to wait for a table, you should.,Magheeta411, glad you enjoyed the food! We appreciate the compliments and hope to see you all again soon! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"The place was recommended by a friend of mine, so we decided to check it out while in San Francisco.
We arrived there around 7PM, there was a line of people outside and we got in the back of the line, we did not have to wait long however as we were pulled out of the line, apparently since we were only a party of two it was easier to seat us, the people ahead of us were all large parties.
The inside is quite a trip, bustling scene with tables filed to capacity, we were seated..fast...couple of menu's hurled at us, two colorful bowls thrown on the table and the waitress was out of here.
So we ordered a few Tsingtao's, fried shrimp pockets, dumplings, beef wraps and sesame chicken, it came out fast & furious and was just about the best Chinese food I have ever had.
Two days later we returned here for lunch, much quieter then, no lines and there was less of a rush, we ordered the calamari & a shrimp dish, once again it was excellent.
This is a truly authentic place to enjoy good Chinese food, if you however expect the white linen, the waitress or waiter patiently standing by your candle lit table offering gentle suggestions then forget about about it, this place is all about the food, and in the end that is what really matters.
Go here, you wont regret it.,,tcdehaas, thank you for the excellent review! I'm glad you took your friend's advice and I'm happy to hear that it was worth it. I hope we can see you again if you're ever back in SF! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"Nice cosy (read small) place with bustling (read short) service in a funky (read slightly off) neighbourhood. But the food made up for everything. Very well priced and plentiful.

"Great atmosphere and food. We thought we'd decided what we wanted to eat but the waitress could tell we didn't really know much about Chinese food and suggested some substitutions which we were happy to try - and boy were they tasty!

Three of us ate - 2 appetisers, 3 mains and rice to share for about $60. Fantastic value and we got to share and try a bit of everything.,peanutismint, you did write a review!

"We were looking for an authentic Asian noodle dish and found it here. Ordered the house noodle dish with fish. The noodles were simple and delicious.

"Twice in the past we had dinned at House of Nan King, and both time enjoyed the experience.  The food was interesting and tasty, the service good, and the atmosphere was upbeat.  The third time was not  the charm.  The waiter was surely.  More disappointing our suffed mushroom caps were overcooked, and the orange chicken tough.  I think on our fourth trip to the City By The Bay we will seek out a new Chinese restaurant.,bretjina, I'm disappointed to hear that your last visit with us wasn't as enjoyable as the ones before it.

"I went 3 years ago and insisted we come back on this business trip since the last time was so good.  This time didn't disappoint!  We were a group of 6 and got there around 7:30, we were seated immediately and were quite happy bc 15 minutes later there was a huge line down the block.  The owner came by and asked if we would like to order off the menu, we said yes - he asked about any allergies and then dishes started coming out immediately.   We started with some amazing marinated mushrooms, a soup I had never had before and was delicious and some of the most tender calamari I've ever had.  We moved on to chicken in a great spicy/sweet sauce, beef with crispy basil, shrimp in a creamy sauce with apples, cuttlefish with steamed bok choy, crispy duck and steamed rice.  Service was fast and efficient, they were very friendly and checked multiple times to make sure everything was good.  Prices are so reasonable - I'll definitely be back on the next trip to SF!,athena15AlbanyNY, it's so great to hear that you'll be back for a third visit! Ordering off the menu is the best way to go, and I'm glad that we were just as delicious as the first time you visited. Can't wait to see you again! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"After spending some time seeing the sights in Chinatown in San Francisco, we made our way to lunch at a much renowned House of Nanking.  Lonely Planet said that it was a combination of “bossy service and bravura cooking” and that best sums it up.  Entering the small establishment, a woman barked if we were a party of two.  After assuring her we were, she pointed and said, “There.”  I assumed she meant us to sit so we did.  We had great seats at the open windows and it provides for great people watching as you eat.  

The menu was not the typical Chinese menu but rather some interesting items including tofu, seafood and the like.  Appetizers included fried onioncakes and main courses included calamari, scallops and fried tofu.  Our dinners included dark meat chicken (something not typically seen in a great many places) and my wife took in some of the tofu.  She is typically not a fan but really enjoyed her meal.  It was quite delicious, even though I’m typically not a fan of dark chicken meat.  My wife enjoyed her meal so much, she said she would have to re-evaluate tofu.

Yes, the people are rude and this kind of place would not work in many locales but we knew this going in as a little research will reveal.  If you can forego that, I think the food is pretty good and the restaurant worth visiting.,baltoteach, thank you for sharing your experience! Lonely Planet has brought us some amazing customers that are usually well prepared for our not-so-typical environment. I'm happy to hear that you and your wife enjoyed the food, so much so that your wife is reevaluating her opinion on tofu! We appreciate the compliments and hope to see you two again if you're ever back in SF! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"Seemingly obscure place with long lines of people deserves notice and this is one of those. We passed on the long line and tried again on a weekday. This was the way to go. Food is as excellent as wait staff is oblivious to good service. Food is served fast, but not with a smile. Even so, don't miss this ""not your average Chinese food."",TravelersOf4, deciding to come back on a weekday was a great choice! Glad you could come in and enjoy a good meal.

"Worst place to eat ever...people who don's speak English...don't care they they don't and that they are not in China! Some good press has gone to their head. Food is terrible, over-priced and service is worse than the food. Avoid! 

Zillions of better places in China Town to eat...this is a tourist trap.,Amit, it's a shame to hear that you weren't more impressed with our food. We know the bustling environment in our restaurant can be hard to get used to, but we definitely want to make sure our guests are enjoying the food. Since we're always striving to improve, we'll keep your comments in mind as we move forward. Thank you for your feedback! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"The menu is very different from that of which americans are accustomed too, a lot of calamari here, pork etc. We ordered the Sesame chicken, melt in your mouth calamari and chow mein. They are all very different from americanized versions, and all tasted absolutely excellent. Do not come here expecting our version of customer service either, everything is very fast paced. You order, it will then come 5-8min, you need anything they just do it right away, however their is none of the small talk checking on your table type stuff. If you need anything just wave a server down walking by and they will do it right away. Excellent experience, would recommend!,Ashley, thank you for recommending us! We appreciate the compliments.

"Great place... Food was excellent, great service and atmosphere...
We didn't order off the menu, I'd definitely recommend doing something similar. We simply asked what was good, the waiter asked ""any allergies? Dislikes? Ok..."" Any wow what a nice surprise.

"We're from the UK and we've never tased Chinese food this good. The menu is different from the usual English/Chinese fair and smaller choice, but it's lovely.

We arrived to find a long queue which was dealt with fairly quickly. Downside to this is they do turn tables and what with the busy atmosphere you will feel a little rushed. Food arrives as it's cooked regardless of being a starter and tables will be mixed - think of Wagamamas. This is the price you pay for a highly popular restaurant serving great food and not wanting to stand outside for too long.

Portion sizes are very generous and i'd allow one dish per person when ordering. Most dishes don't seem to have rice/noodle accompaniment but allow them in the one dish count. Mains are on average about $9. we ordered way too much inc two starters and the bill was $93 for 4. Good value we thought but left loads.,Needmoreholdiays!, thanks for sharing your experience with us! I'm glad your tour bus driver pointed you all in our direction. We do have a bustling environment here, but it keeps things exciting! We appreciate the compliments and hope to see you again if you're back in SF! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"I don't know if it's a trend to make it your signature mark to be nonchalant, but I don't like it. The people of Nanking we're not unfriendly but very stressed out and didn't give you the service you could expect from this wellrenowned place. Went for a wonderful wok with beef which was fantastic with vibrant flavors and a great Tsing Tao beer. The food compensated for the lack of service!,Carl1973, glad you love the food! We know the bustling environment we have in our restaurant can be hard to adjust to, but it's very characteristic of an authentic Chinese restaurant. I'm happy to hear that the food is worth it, though. Hope you can come see us again if you're ever back in SF! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"We have been to House of Nanking a few times over the years, and remembered that the food was very good, so we were pretty excited about going again.  It was a little after noon on a Monday and we were headed for an evening ballgame, so we decided to have a nice lunch first. 

The menu is pretty bewildering, so we asked our waiter what he would recommend that is spicy.  He said “Do you like everything – fish, chicken? Any food allergies?” We assured him that we like all kinds of food and have no allergies.  “Okay, he smiled. I’ll fix you up. I’m the owner.”  This was going to be fun!

It had made us feel kind of special when the owner gave us such personal attention, but after promising to ""fix us up"" we never saw him again, except sitting at a back table doing paperwork or something.  Our food was served by wait staff that did not speak English.

We joked with each other, saying that we hoped he wouldn’t “fix us up” with a humongous bill, but we figured the cost of our lunch would probably be comparable to other menu items.  (Yes, now we admit that we should have asked, or should have given him given him a price limit.)

The first dish arrived. “Honey shrimp,” the young woman told us. And that’s all she said. It was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. Delicious!

The second dish arrived. “What is this?” we asked the young man. His one word answer was “Beef.”   
The “beef” was okay – not great but pretty good. 

The third dish arrived, but we could not understand what the server told us it was. It ended up being some kind of fish.  It was tasty, but soggy in texture.

Overall, the food was pretty good, especially the shrimp.  I would never order the other items – but it’s just as well since we never found out what they were called...  But it was an adventure.

When the bill arrived we expected it to be in the $30-$40 price range, based on the cost of menu items. Three small plates of food and two bottles of beer. 

What a shock to see that we had been charged $61.00 for our adventurous lunch!  

The food was good, but we felt a little ripped off.  Whatever the traffic will bear. We will never recommend Nanking again without telling this story, and I don’t think we will eat there again. There are too many other adventurous places to eat in San Francisco.,PaladiniPotpie, I'm disappointed to hear that you weren't as impressed with us as you have been over the years. Our Chef loves to take care of our guests, but we understand that you can't always get everyone's flavor palates right. Your dishes aren't on the menu, so we hope the price reflects the customized dishes. Since you've been here before, you know we're capable of better. That said, we hope you do decide to come see us again. We'll stand out next time! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"We stopped some businessmen in Chinatown and asked them for a recommended restaurant and they pointed us in this direction.   It was a late lunch and the place was still packed.   This is not a place for comfort but a great place for some of the best Chinese food we have ever had.   The staff is like one you would experience at  a Waffle House.   Be prepared with your order and if you're not they will recommend something and will have it out in short order.,Tcolwell, thanks for taking the time to write a review!

"We had read good things about House of Nanking, and they did not disappoint. 
The service was as expected, very short and sweet. One menu thrown onto the table, not slightly interested in taking drinks orders, practically running away from the table when we had said our food orders. 

However, this did not bother us at all. It just adds some humor and charm to the entire experience. 

We went for the famous Calamari, which arrived in a tangy citrusy sauce. The sesame chicken, which was perfection, the scallops seared in garlic and the eggplant. Everything had different balanced flavors, you can tell they take pride in cooking authentic chinese food. 

Insanely cheap, insanely tasty, and you win them over with compliments, and manage to get a smile on the way out.

Worth a visit!,Tim_Norway, thanks for sharing! It makes our day to hear that we served you the ""best Chinese you've had outside of China""! Great choice on the calamari and Sesame Chicken. Those are crowd favorites. Thank you for your kind words. Hope to see you again in the future! Best, Kathy, Manager"

"Don't be put of if you have to queue the food is worth while. The service is whistle stop with no time given to pleasantries. However the food is very good.

I'm glad you enjoyed the calamari! Hope to see you again soon! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"This is a fun dining experience, but not exactly relaxing.  You wait on the sidewalk and the waiters hurry you to a shared table.  You are then expected to quickly decide on your choices.  If they do not meet with the waiter's approval, he will tell you and change your order.  Our food was great, especially the onion pancakes, the experience memorable.  I thought we might be in an episode of Seinfeld.,daylilypath, this is the first time we've been compared to an episode of Seinfeld! Thanks for making our day!

"We wandered into Chinatown, hungry for some Chinese food. Alas, we forgot that it was a Monday evening, and a few restaurants that we had in mind were closed. After half an hour of restaurant hunting, we stumbled upon this place. 

The restaurant was bustling with life and activity so we thought, alright this should be good. We were asked to wait for 15 minutes. True to their word (which is not always the case in many restaurants with a long line outside), we were ushered in and presented with menus of too many choices.

The chef came by, introduced himself and decided confidently that he would serve us his recommendations and we can save ourselves the trouble of perusing the menu. 

Every dish is surprising and tantalizing for the taste buds -- this is a feat because we cook at home a lot and we can get critical every time we visit a restaurant :p 

The dishes are actually innovations from the chef, as in they aren't exactly traditional recipes that have been replicated in Chinese restaurants the world over. I appreciate this effort, because he manages to concoct flavours that balance tradition and creativity. It also helps that we walked in without any pre-conceived notions of what we were about to expect. 

Most people might find the service sub-par or non-existent, but take heart that this is a Chinese restaurant, the noisy atmosphere and hectic pace are all part of the experience. I would overlook that purely based on how great the food is. 

Verdict: A wonderful gastronomical experience, just don't expect five-star service. 
If I live in SF, I can imagine myself bringing friends every other weekend to eat here.,agentjade, thanks for the excellent review! I'm so happy to hear that you let the chef take care of you all. He loves making everyone feel welcome. I hope you all will come back to SF to see us again! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"We stopped by on a friend's recommendation during our recent trip, and our entire party thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We asked the chef to feed us and everything was very good.

"We visited House of Nanking after reading a recommendation in Lonely Planet. The Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken was delicious, especially the sweet potatoes. A side of Steamed Pork Dumplings were also very good. The service was a little disappointing. The waitress couldn't even manage a smile. Overall, a good experience. I wouldn't hesitate to go back if I'm ever in San Francisco.,pjd88, it makes me happy to hear that you wouldn't hesitate to return! Great choice going with the Sesame Chicken—it's a must-have. I hope the rest of your trip to SF was wonderful. Hope to see you again! Best, Kathy, Manager"
"We stopped into House of Nanking on the recommendation of the TSA officer in the airport who wrote the name of the restaurant on the back of my friend's boarding pass when he heard it was our first time coming to SF for a visit!
 
Arriving to the restaurant during an off-hour for lunch on a weekday was probably a good choice, though it was just happenchance in our case. We walked in, were seated immediately, and after deciding quickly on an appetizer and an entrée to share, were served equally as fast. We opted for the shrimp packets (YUM YUM YUM!) and some bird's nest of noodles dish with fried triangles of tofu with cabbage and onions and sauce. Both dishes were very tasty and if I were here for longer, I would have come back to try some more of the dishes on the menu. 

In fact, we might have come again if the lines to dine hadn't been as long the three or so times we passed by. We didn't have an issue with it-- it's generally a sure sign that the food at a place is tasty. In this case, it's the truth!,InterestedTourist,

Thanks for sharing! I'm glad that TSA agent pointed you in our direction, and that you two came at such a great time of day. It's a unique experience to dine in when the restaurant is crowded as well. If you're ever back in SF, you should try it sometime!

"We came here after a friend recommended it after a recent trip to SF. When we arrived we went in to order take away, there was no clear point of service so asked to order take out from a waitress. We had to ask someone else to place the order who seemed short tempered and didn't want to serve us- 'GO AND STAND OUTSIDE' oh, ok. Thanks? 

We got the food quick enough though, it seemed packed as other reviews said but not a lot of room to manoeuvre so I'm glad we got to experience great food without the sardine feel. 

Loads and loads of tasty food definitely good value for money. Would recommend.,jesscoombs91,

"The House of Nanking is on the edge of Chinatown right across from Francis Ford Coppola's building.  When we walked in I was surprised to find communal tables (reminded me of Durgin Park in Boston).  We sat down immediately (ok it was 5:30 pm Sunday evening) ordered a bottle of chardonnay ($13 for a decent brand) and really good food.  The baby bok choy was awesome, the garlic eggplant superb and the crispy sesame chicken excellent.  Totally worth a stop!,Cagi2013,

"Stopped in around 6 and great timing (no wait when we got there but line developed while eating). It's a small place and the tables & chairs are super close to each other (get friendly with your co-diners!). Tried the shrimp packets & potstickers to start with (thanks to the waitress who let us split the two so we got to try both). Went with the fried rice and the sesame chicken for entrees (we were going to get a noodle dish & the fried rice but the waitress steered us to a non noodle/rice dish). My favorite part of the meal was the sweet potatoes that were with the chicken - delicious! Not the best chinese food i have ever had - but quite tasty.,simonnike,

Thanks for sharing your experience on here as well as on Yelp! Hope you enjoyed yourself while visiting SF! Great choice on the Sesame Chicken—it's a must-have and a crowd-favorite.

"This is a scruffy, bustling restaurant , easy to find as there is usually a queue outside. It's great value  and very popular with the locals. You'll   be seated very close to your neighbours so beware if you suffer from food envy which is why we had to visit twice on a six day visit . Their 'tender squid' really did melt in the mouth and my other half loved the sesame chicken which was sweet and sticky. If you are stuck for what to order, just ask them and they will put something together for you. Dont dress up for this one, you'll feel out of place ! We rang to reserve beforehand but I dont think that means a thing , they will just ask you to wait anyhow.,meesh48,

"I ate here on a recommendation of a co-worker who grew up in San Fran.  We compared Nanking and Brandy Ho's.  No comparison, Nanking is just average.  No lunch menu, more expensive mains, and a very small menu with limited selection.  I had a salt and pepper shrimp meal which WAS good but not worth the price.  Sorry House of Nanking, you don't measure up to Brandy's.,travelmeisteren,

It's a shame to hear that you weren't more impressed with our food. We know our unique take on Chinese food isn't for everyone, but we still think you'll find something you'll like.

"Went into Chinatown to shop. While there, why not experience a meal in Chinatown. Did a quick search in Google, found nothing but great reviews. Decided to give it a try. SO GLAD we did. We told the owner Peter Fang that this was our first time at his est. he took our menus and said I will take care of you. He brought 4 dishes that were out of this world. All perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. Worth any wait you may experience.,sqivdad4life,

"I was looking for a vegetarian dish so I ordered the house noodles. My husband requested a spicy chicken dish. His was pretty good. Mine was a large portion of noodles with just parsley and a couple pieces of cabbage. They were seasoned well but not what I hoped for. I guess asking for suggestions pays off.,Laurel, we definitely recommend having the servers order for you. We always want our guests to come in, ready to be taken care of for the night.

"Every time we are in San Francisco, this is our first restaurant to go to.  Landed at 9:30; at Nanking by 11:00.  Some reviewers are ""put off"" by the service.  My take is that it's ""authentic.""  Some of the waiters and servers don't speak very good English, and the waiters are certainly not ""bubbly,"" but the food is why we are there anyway.  Get the wontons for sure, and, if you have several people, get (and share) a lot of stuff.  Great soup, very good General Tsos.  We had a table full of ""non-foody"" teenagers, but they appreciated the adventure of nontraditional food which happened to be delicious.  Yes, Nanking may not be as ""cool"" as it was years ago, but the food can't be beat.  Do it!!,monjoy,

"We walked up many hills to get to this restaurant and waited to be seated.....it is very popular and it is first come first served.   It was well worth the walk.  The ambience is busy without being in your face.  The service was quick efficient and friendly enough.  But the food was awesome.  Fresh flavours and ingredients makes the dishes just delicious.   Somewhere for a quick lunch that does not leave you feeling like you could not walk the hills back to your hotel....:),Janet, I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed our tasty mix of fresh flavors and ingredients!

"The food was amazing. They do a few dishes and they do them well. There was a line on the sidewalk here for a reason. 
The service is not great in that the waiters/waitresses are there to get your food order and get you moving for turnover purposes. There are people waiting with hungry looks on their faces on the sidewalk! They got my order right and they got the food quickly, which is really what I care about. I don't need people to smile at me before I eat. If you are looking to be pampered, this is not the restaurant for you.,vtjbrent,

"It is one of those places which fails to live up to the name and does not do justice to the genre of cuisine it claims to represent. I do feel it is overpriced considering the service and quality of food. The portion size is sumptuous and is catered towards Western audiences. The Sesame chicken comes with sweet potatoes and is interesting. The calamari is very well made and was the only highlight worth remembering.,Wunderluft,

I'm disappointed to hear that our calamari was the only part of dinner you found impressive. We put a lot of thought in our food, which includes recipes inspired by our experiences, but we're always open to hearing our customers' feedback.

The queue outside on a drizzly San Fran night highlighted it to be a spot to visit. We didn't wait outside too long and were seated in a busy section promptly. The food arrived in different waves with the rice arriving last after the 2 main meals had been served.

"We have eaten here more times than I can count.  We visit San Francisco twice a year and always have lunch here.  This is hands down the best Chinese restaurant in the city.  The food is absolutely incredible.  This visit I had the scallop tower.  I never wanted it to end!  The sauce was delicious and the scallops exquisite!! The food here is so good and of such good quality that it more than makes up for the incredibly rude staff.  I know this restaurant is busy but it is always like that.  The wait staff doesn't even  look at  you while answering questions.  I asked for chopsticks and they were just thrown on the table.  My family has been in the restaurant business for many years and without a doubt this staff is horrible.  However, the food is great!! They really don't care about you so if you don't mind the lack of common courtesy, stop in because the food is fantastic.,DeeDeeAustin_TX,

"A friend and I ventured into Chinatown a little later in the evening: i.e. after 9pm. Most of the area was 'closed', including a lot of the restaurants. We aimed for a couple of places rated well on TripAdvisor, but alas these were closed or only had a short time left open. We turned a corner, and there was House of Nanking - very bright and colourful signage outside. Very busy also, with a couple of groups waiting to be seated.

We were lucky enough to be a two, and so were seated immediately at a nice table by one of the windows. Service throughout was pretty swift, and it looks like they have a speedy turnover of guests. That's not to say we at all felt rushed and even had to ask for the bill (it's *cash only* - no card payment).

Food was quick to arrive after ordering. We tried the pork dumplings and prawn packets. The sauces were tasty, and really helped make the dishes. The prawn dish was a lot of packet and not much prawn, or any filling really so would avoid. The dumplings were quite tasty with the sauce.

For our main course we had the sesame chicken, which seems to be one of their popular/signature dishes, as well as a slow cooked beef dish, which the older gentleman offered to 'make for us'. Boiled rice was all we chose to accompany them. Everything was tasty, and the beef was very, very soft. Not bad at all, but it didn't blow me away. I'd compare it to similar dishes from home in the UK, and not very authentic (which was what we were hoping for from Chinatown; guess you have to be there earlier when places are open!).

Oh, and remember it's cash only - maybe I missed that sign as we walked in/through, but it would really make sense for the servers to announce this when service begins...

Overall, a nice experience, good atmosphere (buzzing) and food was good value, but not great. I'd recommend if you are in a bit of a rush or just looking for something simple.,DeveloperDan,

"I asked a random local on the street where would be a good place to eat. He turned me on to this gem of a restaurant. In his broken English he said ""The food is good, and they are very efficient"". an odd endorsement, I know.

Once I turned around the corner, I saw a line out the door. About a dozen people waiting to eat dinner. I talk to a few people in line and they were all in love with this place.

Even though there was a long line, we were seated promptly, considering the limited space in the restaurant. The staff is more focused on turning the table than anything. But they were still very nice. 

We ordered the Nanking Chicken and the pepper shrimp. We also got some pork egg rolls. Everything was delicious!,Cy,

"We had the sesame chicken and a beef dish. Food was good. Most of the servers were friendly except ours- she was just crabby. I asked a question and, she just snapped at me!

"We visit San Francisco at least once a year and always look forward to a meal at the House of Nanking. It s always a busy and fun place but unfortunately the seem to be letting things slip.

The food was generally good but certainly not up to the level of flavor we have come to expect and the white rice bowl ordered we actually left on the table untouched. The reason is that I saw the waitress serve it 10 minutes before our meal and then place the bowl on a box stacked in front of the counter next to some dirty kitchen cloths they were using to wipe their hands with. Really gross and super unhygienic. There is no way this place would pass a qualified food & health inspection of the premises.

San Francisco has far too many great places to eat and I will certainly not go back to the House of Nanking.,Swimapp,

It's a shame to hear that you aren't as impressed with us as you used to be, but I welcome your feedback. We're always striving to consistently wow our guests, both new and old, so know that I plan to discuss your concerns with the staff.

"This little restaurant/bistro-kind was suprisingly good in Chinese food. I was here with my husband and kids, and even the children loved the food. Good beef (which was recommended) and chicken with vegetables and rice. Spicy, tasty sauces (not too hot). You only get a plate and a fork to eat with, and the beer I ordered I had to drink out of the bottle. The serving was quick and not so personal, but because of the great food I still give this restaurant a 5-star. Hope to come back sometime soon...,RolandSusanne,

"We were directed to this place by our wine tour guide. He told us the food is so good  people don't seem to mind how pushy they are to customers. And it's almost customary to be rude ha ha, we were sold!!! We sat down and within a matter of minutes were told by the server he would bring us a variety. And before we knew it he had taken our menus and we were left thinking. AWESOME!!! More restaurants should go this route. Sometimes you miss out of whats really good at a place because you are given too many options. This way we got to try everything and let me just say.....everything we had was FANTASTIC!! It was so much fun getting brought a different dish every 10 minutes or so. If you aren't too picky of an eater then just let them order for you. And with five of us our bill was only $100 bucks or so including beer.,Jessica40,

"This is a legendary location for us as we first visited in the early 90s.  Not much has changed.  They cram in the diners and you will probably meet some new friends during your stay.  Tables are cramped, so be prepared.  Food has always been consistently good and priced well.  You'll encounter a line at the door if you wait until 7 pm.  Since our first visit, we have always taken to forgetting the menu and asking the server to choose a few dishes for us.  This time was seafood and chicken.  We also had two appetizers.  Portobello mushroom was fantastic as were the vegetable dumplings.  Nanking chicken and crispy shrimp rounded out the meal.  Yum.,Keng073,

"House of Nanking was recommended to us by a friend who lives in the neighborhood, a native of the area.  He warned us that the seating arrangements were cozy and the food is served as-is, with substitutions vocally discouraged and servers who will recommend dishes to indecisive diners.  But, he said, the food is worth it.  After visiting, I have to say that he is right on all counts.  
We came on a Tuesday night, apparently right before the dinner rush, and got the last private table in the corner.  In contrast to some of the other reviews posted on here, we found the service to be very good.  The staff here is extremely efficient, and this focus on efficiency shows.  They expect you to be ready to order, and know what you want, without too much waiting around.  We didn’t find this off-putting; in fact, we were surprised at how fast everything we ordered arrived.  We ordered the salt and pepper shrimp, the garlic fish and some vegetable dishes, all of which were excellent.  Flavorful, spicy (but not overly so) and really fresh.  The value for the money is great, particularly for San Francisco.  
This restaurant has exceptional Chinese food, at very good prices, in a family-run atmosphere.  The service is fast and focused; the wine list is straightforward (one brand of each type, you order by type alone, available in glasses or bottles) and the atmosphere is loud and lively and crowded.  It feels as though you might be in Asia, and is highly recommended for those who might be slightly more adventurous in their dining tastes, or at least laid back in their expectations.  Particularly in a city where food and dining can be blown out of proportion, it was really refreshing to find a place that focused on one thing – excellent, authentic food – and executed it so well.,S,

Thank you for such a wonderful review! We're glad you followed your friend's recommendation to our restaurant. Sometimes a warning about the bustling environment of our restaurant is needed, and it's great to hear that you were open to the idea. Great choices on the salt and pepper shrimp and garlic fish!

"I was visiting SF, and I passed by Kearny St. and saw this restaurant, and the moment I sat down and checking out the menu, the waitress came in and asked me right away ""What do you want"" and she even grab the menu from me, and pointed out, and asked me do you want this, this or this?
It was so rude, but I was so curious about their food, so I ended up ordering something with potatoes, sweet and sour pork and rice, the food was not that so great as i thought, and the rice was so little.
I would never go back here again!!!!,Cate,

I'm sorry if you were off-put by our service. Our restaurant is known for having a very busy, bustling atmosphere, characteristic of many authentic Chinatown restaurants. We like to keep things fast and efficient around here so everyone gets seated and fed. It can take some getting used to, and sometimes a warning is just needed, especially if it's your first time.

"I've been visiting San Francisco since the late 1990's and have always made a point of eating at the House of Nanking when in town.

When asked if I've ever eaten here before I always say no so that the waiter/waitress selects the plates.  I usually arrive with a large group (3-7 people) and a wide variety of appetizers and entrees are served.  

This particular trip there were 5 of us and we had:

A cold salad-like appetizer made of uniquely cut asparagus and other assorted greens
Sautéed mushrooms (huge and delicious)
Soup (the least exciting part of the meal, but none-the-less delicious)
Onion Cakes with peanut sauce (to die for!)
Calamari
Honey shrimp (surprisingly not too sweet, really delicious, apples and shrimp together on one plate)
Sesame Chicken
Beef so tender you could cut it with your fork, we are guessing something like short rib
Garlic Fish (the house specialty and we could see why)

We all shared and tried everything and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

This is the kind of place to go and try new dishes and tastes.  Our waitress was efficient (food started to come out almost immediately) and personable.  She made the experience unforgettable.  That is why I'll be returning for years to come.,adcruise,

"My boyfriend and I went to House of Nanking for a night out in SF. It was amazing. I would go back to SF just to eat here again. The noodles, the loose leaf tea (at one point, the couple next to us asked what I was drinking because it looked so good!), everything just melts in your mouth. It can be a little cramped, the hostess seats guests at the same table with other guests but it doesn't bother me.

"Did'nt book, called in at about 6pm, Fantastic food, had the blossoming flower tea, wow! try it, great fun.
   Theres a real buzz about the place, it's sort of matter of fact and bussling. They were very busy, but we did'nt have to wait long to be seen and the food was pretty quick in coming too.
   I'm sure at least one dish was chosen for us, did'nt really mind, it was the tenderest beef I have ever, ever eaten.  It was piping hot, very tasty and there was a enough, and I was starving. Got full and stayed full.
   Later on that night I noticed I wasn't at all thirsty, which I have experienced a lot after eating Chinese food, which is another great thing about the food here.
   I will always come here to enjoy the food and atmosphere when I'm in San Francisco.,Thank you so much for making us a stop by while you were visiting the city!

The server made great recommendations and everything came out quickly and hot off the burners. The stuff mushrooms were delicious as were the salt and pepper prawns, sesame chicken and onion cakes. I wasn't too hungry when I came in but ate everything in site. It was well worth the calories. Can't wait to go back. Note: They don't split checks so pick someone to pay for the single bill.,I'm glad that you were so impressed with all of your server's recommendations! It's such a compliment that you consider us to be the best authentic Chinese food you've tasted. Thank you! If you are ever back in SF, don't hesitate to stop by and see us. 

Have a great day,

"This place is NOT appealing to the eye but boy is the food great !! I Have been to SFO 3 times in the past few years and my last visit was for 3 days.........I ate there everyday for 3 days !! I was so sad when I had to leave because I knew it had to come to an end !! Every dish was an explosion of taste and not expensive either !! 
I would recommend this place without a doubt. You just have to excuse the somewhat below average service because the food makes up for it. Some of the wait staff were quite rude but you ignore it after you have been there 3 days in a row lol  My last visit I made sure I stayed close to Kearney Street so I could eat and walk back to the Hotel. Oh how I miss the food just thinking about it !!,Jodielee22565,

Thanks for sharing! We appreciate the compliments and were happy to see you each day. I hope you can come back soon! We'd love to have you again and again.

"Top 5 best meals ever. Owner came over and introduced himself and removed our menus and feed us 4 courses that were  amazing. A must stop in China Town.,mrfalcon32,

Thanks for the compliments! Glad you enjoyed our chef's selections for you. That's the way to go when it's your first time here! Hope to see you all again when you're back in SF!

"Food was very good but service wasn't friendly, no good for children, I was over charged with a dish I didn't order and felt it was over priced for a 40 min meal pushed in and out.,Love-food11050,

It's never easy to read reviews from unhappy guests, but I welcome your feedback. Although you enjoyed the food, it's a shame that our service didn't live up to the same standards. Our restaurant has a busy, bustling environment, so things are a little faced paced. Kids are definitely welcome here!  Please let me apologize for the mistake on your bill. We'll make sure that doesn't happen again. With that said, I hope you'll decide to visit us again when you're in the mood for good Chinese food!

"My wife and I came here for lunch based on a friend's recommendation.  As we waited for service I noticed multiple accolades hanging on the wall further increasing my expectations.  Our server asked us if we were ready and then said ""What do you want?"" in a quick tone.  Well, no big deal, we ordered the pork egg rolls, the garlic fish and the sesame chicken.  There was little to choose from and there was only one chicken entree on our menu.  The egg rolls were good.  I received my fish and my wife received her order of rice but she didn't get her plate of chicken until several minutes later.  The sauce on my fish had a good flavor but I wasn't used to the squishy texture and I would not order it again.  The sesame chicken was plain gross.  Not only was it dark meat, but the meat was chewy as if maybe there were tendons included.  It was also overcooked.  She couldn't eat much of it so I helped as we don't like to waste food.  When we got our bill, it came to $34 and we only drank water.  They also charged us for two orders of rice. (I asked if my entree came with rice but never ordered it.)  When I gave her my credit card to pay she said only cash.  So I had to go next door and pay $2.75 fee to use the ATM.,trafficsignalguy,

It's never fun reading reviews from unsatisfied customers, but I welcome your feedback. It's a shame you didn't enjoy your garlic fish and sesame chicken. Those are some of our most popular dishes, so you might have caught us on a bad day. Everyone has them, and unfortunately, it sounds like we did. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It'll help us make sure it doesn't happen again. With that said, I hope you'll give us another chance if you're ever back in SF. We know we're capable of impressing you!

"When we were looking at the menu, the chef approached our table and asked if this was our first visit to the restaurant. When we said yes, he asked us if we trusted him to bring us a selection of his choices. We felt adventurous and said Ok! The meal was several courses and included soup, appetizer and three different main dishes consisting of beef, chicken and shrimp. Each dish was wonderful and we loved the anticipation of wondering what would come out next. The atmosphere is casual and seating is close together, but this sort of adds to the flavor of the place. There are stacked cases of beverages and food supplies giving it a warehouse look, but the decor seems to fit with the clientele. We were pleasantly surprised that our special meal turned out to be quite reasonable! It was in the mid $80 range including drinks for the four of us.,Emma-Leigh,

Thanks for sharing! It's great to hear that you let the chef order for you. That's one of the best decisions you can make around here! It sounds like he served you a little bit of everything. Glad you all loved it. We appreciate the compliments, and hope to see you again whenever you're back in SF!

"House of Nanking is really fun -- pleasant, informal atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable waiters and waitresses.
Yes, there will be a line most of the time. The food really is excellent and the prices are good. It's worth a wait.

(Get the pea shoots, and pretty nearly any of the sea food.),Crito0,

Thanks for sharing! We love hearing good things from our guests, especially when they say our food ""is worth the wait"" and it ""really is excellent and the prices are good"". Awesome recommendation for the pea shoots and seafood! Your fellow TripAdvisor users will appreciate that. Hope to see you again!

"We stopped here for a late lunch and grabbed some food and a drink.  The food was brought out quickly and was delicious.  The price was average for Chinese.  The service was authentic Chinatown-esque!  I would recommend a stop for lunch while you are milling about and taking in the sights of San Francisco's Chinatown!,Erin,

Glad you all got to stop in and try our food! We're happy to have added some good eats to your SF experience, and thank you for recommending us. Hope to see you all again whenever you're back in the Bay Area!

"Our daughter told us about it when she visited many years ago and the hotel endorsed the recommendation for us on this trip. We walked from Union Square, its about 15 to 20 minutes. We waited outside for a short time in line. They don't take names and they didn't give us a table  for two but we shared a table with two young men. The decor is basic and the atmosphere is akin to being in a busy place in Hong Kong. The meal was wonderful and original. The Onion Cake starter was the best starter I ever had anywhere in a Chineses restaurant in Europe Midddle East or America. The staff were efficient and we had excellent service.  We couldn't finish all that was presented and we really enjoyed it. We stayed til it closed and met the owner and had our photo taken with him. Great guy with a great attitude. It's a must visit for us when we come back to San Francisco.,FredCork,

Thank you for sharing! I enjoyed reading your review, and am happy to hear that visits to our restaurant are recommended throughout the family. The Onion Cake as a starter is a crowd favorite—great choice! We appreciate you mentioning the short walk from Union Square, and the casual operations of our restaurant. I'm sure your fellow users on TripAdvisor will appreciate the tips as well. Having you all stay until closing was such a treat! Thanks for the compliments. We look forward to seeing you when you're back in SF!

"If you don't know what you want, the owner will help customize a meal for your party. The food was amazing, a bit overpriced, but worth the experience. The line is out the door but moves quickly. Order the hot tea its incredible.,Thanks for sharing your experience! Letting the chef order for you is one of the best decisions you can make at our restaurant. We're so glad you made the right choice! We appreciate you mentioning that the line moves quickly. We definitely try to get everyone in and fed! The Hot Tea is a fantastic suggestion! I'm sure your fellow users on TripAdvisor will happily take your recommendations. We appreciate the compliments, and hope to see you when you're back in SF!

"We arrived in a large group and had to wait only minutes as they organised our seatings. Once seated the head chef insisted to order for us and also catered individual portions for those who had specific food allergies. And what tops off this accommodating service is when great tasting dishes are delivered. Highly recommend the portobello mushrooms and a what appeared to be lightly fried beef cubes.,Thank you for your review. I'm happy to hear that your group had a great time here! Letting the chef order for you is one of the best decisions you can make, especially if you've never been here before. Glad you enjoyed the mushrooms and beef! I'm sure your fellow TripAdvisor users will appreciate your suggestions. Hope to see you again when you're back in SF!

"The theme was chinese but a twist of the west came through
as the flavors were not to be found elsewhere in Chinatown. The cost was a bit more than what was usual for the area.,Thanks for your review. I'm happy to hear that our Chinese food, with a unique twist, was worth the wait! We love using fresh ingredients in our dishes, and we hope our prices reflected that. We hope to see you again whenever you're back on the west coast!

"We had a friend that had visted SF and highly recommended the House of Nanking.  We ate there our first night and it was delicious.  The place is charming and the food was great.  Loved the Bing Bao Beef and the Nan's famous chicken.  
Food was so great that we went back and ate there again on our last night.
This is a must visit while in SF.,Colby,

Thanks for sharing your experience! I'm glad you visited us during your trip. The Bing Bao Beef was a great choice! I hear that Texans like their beef, so I'm happy to hear that was one of your selections. I'm flattered that you managed to see us twice during your vacation. We'd love to have you back as many times as we can. Hope to see you when you're back in SF!

"So, I was standing at Kennedy Airport Friday, March 1st waiting to be screened by the TSA.  It was early in the morning and I was a bit irked, but managed to smile at the TSA agent standing by the machine and said, ""good morning, how are you?""  To which he replied , ""I'm doing just great and how are you?"" so I replied, ""I'm just fine and dandy."" He laughed and said that my ""fine and dandy"" was about as sincere as his ""doing just great,"" and then asked where I was headed.  When I replied ""San Francisco,"" the agent beamed and said, ""Best place to visit in the world! You MUST visit the House of Nanking!""  He proceeded to write the name and street location (Kearny Street) on my boarding pass and handed it to my husband as I went into the machine.  I posted a photo of my boarding pass on Facebook, and no sooner had I done so, when half a dozen friends said that I MUST go to House of Nanking!  So, the TSA not only screens you now, but gives you decent restaurant recommendations.  Well, I was very happy I took the TSA agent's advice and made the sojourn to House of Nanking.  I had a delicious dining experience: I would definitely recommend ordering the onion cake (a tasty take on a scallion pancake, but more crisp, fresh and served with a yummy peanut sauce) and the flowering tea (a lovely flower opens from a little ball of leaves floating in a beer stein-sized glass).  The onion cake was so compelling that a couple dining next to me asked me what it was and I obligingly gave them slices to taste: the portions were so generous, I could not finish it by myself.  Further proof of the onion cake's allure is that I was sitting in the window with my back to the street and a man came into the restaurant and said to me, ""Excuse me: I was walking by and had to ask you what you are eating--it looks so delicious!"" I told him it was the onion cake and that he should try it, as it was indeed delicious. The man proceeded to sit down at another table and ordered the onion cake.  The service was perfectly pleasant and obliging and I was very happy to have had my very delightful House of Nanking moment.  As a matter of fact, I wound up sitting next to a San Franciscan at Cafe Sabarsky (at the Neue Galerie) this week and asked her if she had ever been to the House of Nanking: as it happens she had not, but she wrote it down and said she would go. Thanks, TSA agent: you made my trip not only safe to San Francisco, but very tasty, too!,Thanks for sharing! I really enjoyed reading your review, and am so amused by how our restaurant was recommended to you. Normally, you don't expect a TSA officer to give you a dinner suggestion while you're waiting in line! We're glad he did, though. 

The Onion Cake was a great choice! I'm sure your fellow TripAdvisor users will appreciate your suggestion. Since it's such a favorite of yours, I'm surprised you were able to share it! That was very generous of you, and a great reflection of the type of customers we have here. Good people, enjoying good food, and having a great time! 

I'm thrilled that you got to visit us while in SF, and even recommended us to an SF-local! We look forward to seeing you whenever you're back in the Bay Area!

"Went here on a recommendation and very happy I did.  The server, an older gentleman, asked us if we liked food other than chicken, which we had ordered.  We said yes, and so agreed to chef's recommendations.  Food was twice what we had ordered, but so much more tasty and innovative starting with a mushroom appetizer.  If you're willing to trust the server and pay a bit more, you could have an outstanding meal -- and this is from someone who generally is not fond of Chinese food.  This is not your typical corner Chinese place with routine and heavy sauces.  A great experience and reinforces my inclination to be very, very choosy about Chinese restaurants.,Thanks for sharing! I enjoyed reading your review, and am happy to hear that you followed a friend's recommendation here. Leaving your order up to the server is one of the best ways to really enjoy dinner here. Great choice! Hearing that you loved our dishes, especially since you're not fond of Chinese food, really makes my day! Thanks again. We look forward to seeing you next time you're in SF!

"The food was good.  Relatively inexpensive.  Very busy and somewhat slow service though.  The tables and chairs were a but rickety.,Thanks for sharing. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed the food.

"Food was ""ok"", but it was crowded, and they didn't want to take the credit card until we insisted.  Not worth the wait, next time we'll walk around and find the ""local"" hot spots.,Although it's not fun reading poor reviews, I appreciate your feedback. We prefer it when our customers pay in cash to save everyone money on the hidden fees that come with transactions. Sorry, we didn't explain that more.

"Our party of three had dinner at House of Nanking, on the recommendation of the woman at the front desk of the hotel I was staying at. House of Nanking is a small, not fancy restaurant right on Kearney. We sat at a big wooden table. Waitress came by and asked if we wanted fish, chicken or beef, then basically ordered for us. She also told us we wanted dumplings for appetizers. The food was wonderful, the service was not what you'd call attentive, but, hey, the place is bustling and the staff is busy. We sat and talked for a long time after dinner, nobody pressured us to leave. Bill came to $50 for three people. I'd go back again.,nealwBoston,

"When I asked for directions to the restaurant I was told this is a tourist trap...

The decor in the restaurant should have given a good indication of what to expect... western wine bottles lining the walls, but with traditional chinese wooden tables and chairs. Food tastes alright, nice enough for me to finish what I ordered, but maybe it was because of the dishes I ordered (noodle and appetizer), I was confused if I had entered an ""asian fusion"" restaurant. There was a chinese menu and maybe those would have been more authentic, but the staff weren't helpful at recommending anything. I definitely wouldn't call what I ordered authentic chinese food.,I'm disappointed to hear that you weren't more impressed with our food. Usually, our servers are more than happy to recommend food for you. And, you're right, our food isn't typical authentic Chinese food. We've created our recipes based on our experiences. Nonetheless, we're always striving to improve and appreciate your feedback. We hope to be better in the future!

"Ok... so everything I have had here is so good! The first time I went, the waiter surprised us with different dishes to try and everything was fantastic. The garlic fish has to be one of my favorites there, along with all of their soups... yum yum yum.,Emily, thanks for sharing! I'm happy that we left such a great impression on you after your first visit. Having the waiter surprise you with a spread of our best dishes is such a treat, isn't it?

"We wanted to eat Chinese, but were a little nervous about eating some of the food in Chinatown. Some friend told us about Nanking, and it was a great experience. It is just on the edge of Chinatown, and proves to be a great alternative. The food comes in gigantic portions, so I recommend splitting an entree. We received great service and got there early, so we immediately got a seat. Our server helped us order based on things that we like. The food tasted great. We ordered a soup and two entrees, and all of it was delicious! I definitely recommend this restaurant.,Thanks for sharing! I'm glad you took your friend's recommendation to visit us for Chinese food. I'm so pleased to hear that you enjoyed your dinner as well. Thanks for recommending us.

"Insanely busy, quite loud, line out the door, a bit expensive for Chinese, and so worth it.  We tried fried calamari, braised beef, scallops in gingery sauce, homemade dumplings, gyoza, and a deep-fried sweet and spicy chicken. Also some sort of hot salad with sweet potatoes and sliced summer squash (was it chayote?) 

It didn't follow my Inverse Decor theory (the worse the decor, the better the food).  Rather, the decor was reasonably nice (although it was freakishly loud, with a lot of hard surfaces).  And did I mention the food was incredible? 

The calamari wasn't really stellar - it was nicely cooked and the coating was fairly crisp and not at all too heavy, but it didn't seem to taste like much of anything. Nice texture, though.  Everything else was just delicious - others liked the dumplings better, but my favorite dishes were the velvety-textured braised beef and the scallops, both of which dishes were perfect. Sorry I don't remember the specific names of all the dishes, but the wait staff is happy to recommend. 
I'd go back in a heartbeat.,Thanks for sharing your experience with us! I'm happy to hear that our food is worth the wait. We have crowds every night, so it's good to hear that our guests are satisfied! 

Chayote isn't in our hot salad. It's actually just what you said—sliced summer squash!

It sounds like you got a really great tasting of the menu. Hearing that our food is incredible really makes our day! The braised beef and the scallops are fantastic recommendations. We'll see you next time!

"I was excited to eat at House of Nanking especially having had great experiences at Fang's (Sister restaurant).  I fully expected House of Nanking to be more of a family restaurant than Fang's.

There was no wait and the service was efficient.  The dumplings were average, served with a black bean sauce.  The sesame chicken was good, but certainly not exceptional

Glad I went to visit, but next time I will go back to Fang's.,Thanks for your review. I'm happy you gave it a chance! Compared to Fang, our restaurant gives a little more variety to the family.

"this place sees lots of tourists, so act like a local, be chilled, and be flexible. best thing to do is be nice to the staff who are always hurried- (ne hao ma?--how are you? seems to work).  we always look at everyone elses food to see what looks good that night, point to, ask about, and order. everything done in big woks so be creative, and just ask for what you want- shrimp, chicken, pork, beef, and what ever vegetables you want. they'll make various levels of spicy.,BILLandDD,

"We ate here on New Year's Eve without a reservation. The place was very busy but able to get us in quickly. There is limited seating and the place fills up fast. The food is very good, fresh, well seasoned, presented nicely. Decor is not fancy but you don't need it when the food is really good. The Bao Bing Wrap was very nicely flavored and came with 4 pancakes. A bit more vegetables would be nice but still a good serving size. The Scallop Tower tasted great. The mix of flavors was incredible and the scalloped tasted really fresh. The serving size (3 large scallops) was a bit small for the price but packed with flavor. The best ""deal"" is the flowering tea which is served in a large glass mug and will convert any coffee drinker. A great place that we look forward to returning to. From the looks of the dishes coming out of the chicken, the sesame chicken is very popular.,Thanks for taking the time to review us, Hiker-7. I'm happy to hear that you got to spend New Year's Eve with us. All your compliments are greatly appreciated, and I'll make sure to pass them on to the entire staff—they'll love to hear them! I'm glad you loved the flowering tea. We agree, the presentation alone can convert any coffee drinker. The Bao Bing Wrap is a great choice, along with the Scallop Tower. As for the Sesame Chicken, you saw right, it's a crowd favorite, so be sure to try it when you come visit us again. With that said, we look forward to your next visit! Thanks again. - Warm regards, Kathy, Manager"

"We had 8 people which allowed us to try a lot of food items.  The fried Onioncakes rocked.  The House Fried Rice was light, fres, and very favorable.  The sesame chicken with sweet potatoes were a crowd favorite.  How about a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for $13.95 - this was a grow up favorite :-).   The Fried Calamari was tasty and very lightly fried,  get as appetizer.   Line forms outside but goes quick.   Place is active and loud - very entertaining.,Thanks for the stars! It's always nice to hear that a guest has enjoyed their meal, and I promise to share your praises with our kitchen. The next time you're visiting from Atlanta, make sure to stop by! Until then, take care.

"This is not your everyday Chinese restaurant - items on the menu may sound like standard fare but each has a nice twist with fresh ingredients, lighter sauce preparation, and skillfully combined flavors.  Take the hot and sour soup, compared to many ""standard"" preparations - less hot, subtle tang, surprising bits of fresh vegetables, no gelatinous thickeners, and with great taste.  Potstickers typically come with a soy-vinegar sauce; these had a delicious light peanut sauce.  We shared four main dishes, all very good.  The group favorite was the sesame chicken, a specialty of this place; it came with sliced cooked sweet potato and a sliced green apple-like vegetable.  We loved the salt and pepper shrimp and mushrooms; the mushrooms had a delicate flavor.  I loved the ginger garlic poached scallops prepared with large leaves of spinach; I had this over rice and could eat this every day!  The Bao Bing Wrap might roughly equate to a Moo Shu pork but came with large strips of beef already marinated (instead of chopped up with the usual cabbage, shoots, hoisin sauce etc.); this dish was almost too healthy for us, coming with fresh shredded lettuce and tomato to combine in the wraps.  Hot blossoming flower tea with something like jujube fruits was the crowning fun treat, waiting to see which flower we had - they opened to reveal a jasmine blossom.  This was an excellent meal and very pleasant change of pace.  Service was excellent.  You have to arrive early to get seated promptly because it is very popular.,I'm flattered that you think we're not your ""everyday Chinese restaurant."" This is great to hear, as we work hard to craft complex and unique options. We appreciate your kind words, and hope to welcome you back soon. Thanks so much for the five-star review, and take care!

"Three dishes on a limited menu all tasted the same and that taste wasn't good. Most chinese food I've eaten in the past is a balance of flavours and spice. This food had no freshness and was very bland. So dumplings, noodles and a large round onion pastry thing all with the same sauce. They have no idea.,I was disappointed to hear that you weren't more impressed with your meal. We are committed to using nothing but fresh, quality ingredients, and work hard to ensure that every dish is full of flavor. Still, would you let me know how you think your food could have been more satisfying?

One thing that I think sets us apart from other restaurants is that you don't necessarily have to order off the menu here. In fact, we encourage you not to! Just tell us what you like and don't like, and we'll put together a dish just for you. 

Hopefully you'll give us another chance to ""wow"" you. We can do better, and would love to prove it to you! Thanks so much for sharing, and take care.

"And trust the cook at House of Nanking. Don't even look at the menu. Everything they bring is good. Some things are interesting and different but hey, that is why we try new places, right?  Enjoyed myself here with my family. Low key and fun.,Thanks for reviewing us! We're happy to hear that you always enjoy dining here—this is what we hope for, after all. Come back soon! 

Take care,

"Had to stop at the House of Nanking, as its widely known as the best in Chinatown SF.  It was worth it just to see all the folks visiting, many international guests and lots of regulars.  I visited with a friend who lives in SF, so she helped me order, etc. but that process could be a bit rushed or confusing if you're visiting.  I found the food to be rather average for what I was expecting from the ""best"" in Chinatown.  Maybe my hopes were too high or maybe it was an off day (?) but it was worth it to at least say I have been there.,Thanks for coming in! We aim to be the best restaurant in the area, and are sorry to hear that we didn't quite live up to your expectations. Would you let me know what you ordered, and how you think it could have been more enjoyable? Trust that I'll share your comments with our kitchen. As you pointed out, we are widely regarded as one of the best places to eat in Chinatown—this must give some indication of just how great our food and service are! Hopefully you'll give us a second chance to better represent ourselves the next time you're in town. Until then, take care.

Best wishes,

"This place doesn't seem like much when you first walk in, although it was fairly busy. The menu isn't that big, but everything we had was very good. The Wonton Soup looked different than any I've ever had and I thought I wouldn't like it based on how it looked, but it was delicious. The pork egg rolls were amazing, and were my favorite dish. The fried rice and sesame chicken were also very good.,Few things are more gratifying than hearing that we offer the ""best"" Chinese food in the area. Thank you! Have you always ordered off the menu? Next time, let your server know what you like and don't like and we'll put together a dish just for you. I can confidently say you won't be let down! We hope to welcome you back soon. Thanks again, and take care.

"I looked up ""best food in Chinatown San Fran"" and House of Nanking appeared the results many times. So upon walking around in the very authentic China Town (more so than NYC), we came across the House of Nanking. The service was a little confusing because we felt a little rushed at first and our server changed a few times, this is what keeps me from giving it a full 5 stars. I know its not very adventurous to get Sesame chicken at a Chinese restaurant, its of course one of the more common dishes anywhere you go in the country. I must say though, this may have been some of the best I have ever had. It was so tender and juicy and their sauce was better than any I have had before, it was unique for Sesame Chicken. My friends also had great things to say about the won-ton soup. Prices were relatively cheap for all the positive reviews and distinction this place seems to have. It was lunch time and it began to fill up, but you can tell it is a very quick turnaround so you wont be waiting long if you do have to wait. I would recommend checking this place out if you decided to stroll around China-Town. Enjoy!,Thanks for coming in! The Sesame chicken is a tried and true classic, and I'm pleased to hear that you enjoyed it. Next time you come in, don't order something off the menu. Let us know what you like, and our kitchen will whip up something just for you! We appreciate your kind words, and hope you'll come visit us when you're back in town. Until then, take care.

"The service isn't exactly why you visit this ppace - the awesome food is. Delicious sauces make every meal delicious.,Thanks for the stars!

"On a long weekend in San Francisco back in Oct 2012, three of us wanted quality Chinese food. I’m usually a bit sceptical about following every recommendation in guidebooks, but this time I was really happy we went for House of Nanking. As the guidebook suggested, the staff were not particularly friendly. In fact, they came across as somewhat aggressive. However, that was soon forgotten when the food arrived. I can’t really fault the food at all – great fresh/seasonal ingredients, definitely not the stereotypical greasy Chinese take-out. I’ve since recommended House of Nanking to friends visiting SF and everyone has raved about it.,Thanks for taking the time to write such a nice review. I’m glad you decided to take the guide book's suggestion and visit us! As you could probably tell, we’re definitely not your stereotypical Chinese restaurant. Including fresh ingredients in our dishes really sets us apart. I’m happy to hear that you enjoyed our food, so much so that you’ve recommended us to your friends. We appreciate it! Thanks again and come see us when you’re back in the Bay Area. 

Sincerely, 

Kathy, Manager"
"Not quite your standard run of the mill Chinese, but a handful of really excellent tasty dishes, fresh and quick service. Perfect for an early jet-lag busting meal. Scallops were outstanding.,Thanks for the kind review. I’m happy to hear that you found the scallops very satisfying. You’re right, we do set ourselves apart from typical Chinese restaurants by serving fresh and excellent dishes. Glad to hear that you enjoyed your visit. Come see us again if you need to bust another bout of jet-lag!

"Great service, fabulous food.  Their sesame chicken really is as good as everyone says it is. The prices are extremely reasonable for San Francisco.,Thanks for the stars!

"This was just what I was looking for traveling with my 12 year old Chinese food loving granddaughter. Simple menu of excellent traditional food in a casual, friendly atmosphere. It is crowded and service is quick this is NOT the place for a leisurely dining experience. Potstickers were the favorite. Portions were generous.,Thanks for reviewing us, Nancy! I'm happy that you and your granddaughter enjoyed your dishes. Which options did you try, other than the pot stickers? Next time you visit, don't order off the menu! Rather, tell us what you like and don't like, and we'll make a dish just for you. We hope to see you soon! Thanks again, and take care.

"Walking in to the restaurant for lunch was not what I expected. The place was very disheveled and a little unkempt...Service was great. Food was great. Experience was great.

Tell them how hungry you are and let them serve you, and please don't let the appearance stop you..You won't be sorry.,Thanks for the five-star review! I'm pleased that we managed to go above and beyond your expectations. Good choice trusting us to whip up a dish for you, by the way. What all did you end up trying?

"Stopped by for a late Friday lunch and ordered an ""I trust you.""  The server asked me what I liked and 10 minutes later as I received a fantastic plate of garlic fish on a bed of sauteed greens with a bowl of rice.  It was fantastic!  I highly recommend this place.,Thanks for the five-star recommendation, Jeff! Good call ordering an ""I trust you.""

"We were so excited to for dinner hear after reading all of the amazing reviews!  But it really didn't live up to many of them :(.

It wasn't an issue sitting close to others that you didn't know but our waiter walked away before we were even finished ordering?!  I hate when you feel rushed or you are inconveniencing them...not right.

We ordered the chicken pot stickers..not sure if there was an option to get them steamed or pan fried but they came steamed and they were OK...i think we would have wanted them pan fried.

I ordered the famous Sesame Chicken...and it made me a little sick. People LOVE this dish but it just wasn't for me.

My boyfriend had the white fish and loved it!

Either way it was cheap, quick and we didn't have to wait in line (although there was one...maybe bc we only have 2 people?)

Being in chinatown there has to be a better restaurant from my perspective."
"Second trip to this tiny trendy restaurant on the edge of Chinatown was no disappointment.  Friendly service and great food. Tonight was chilly so my steamed dumplings in black bean sauce, and hot & sour soup were perfect. The dumplings were especially good. Be prepared to rub elbows with your neighbors in this friendly little place.,Thanks for the stars! Glad that ""friendly service and great food"" made your experience a positive one. And good call ordering the steamed dumplings. The black bean sauce that comes with them is incredible! What other things did you get a chance to try? 

The next time you're in town, swing on by! We'd love to see you. Thanks again, and take care.

"Everything you've read about this restaurant is true. The food is superb, the quarters close, and the service entertaining. We let our waitress order for us and were very pleased with the outcome. Everything was flavorful; quite different from the usual Chinese fare you'll find elsewhere. The long line outside says it all ... it's worth the wait!,""The food is superb, the quarters close, and the service entertaining""—this is music to our ears! Thank you so much for rating us. As a restaurant that has aimed to make it's cuisine unique and different, I was flattered to read your comments. What dishes have you tried?

"I've eaten here a few times while in San Francisco and love it! I seem to have a different experience everytime. If you go with a group, it's best just to tell the wait staff if there's anything you don't like or are allergic to and otherwise just to surprise you with whatever they think is the most delicious. Last time it was just my husband and I and we ordered soup (yum) and the famous chicken (I can't remember the name of the dish but it was also delicious) and some noodles. Everything is really good. They serve cheap beer and wine but no liquor. Their hot tea is really good. It's a casual place but at night can get really crowded. Their tables all seat many people so be prepared to share a table with strangers.,I'm happy to hear that you always enjoy dining with us! Like you said, tell us what you like and don't like, and we'll make a delicious dish just for you. We won't let you leave disappointed! 

You've hit upon everything we strive for, and it's much appreciated. We look forward to welcoming you back the next time you're in San Francisco! Thank you, and take care.

"after a night show, i went there with 5 friends.
The place was closing but luckily they were kind enough to let us in.
The waitress asked us if we had already been there before and few of my friends answered: yes.
She asked then how hungry we were and we answered: a lot!
She left without taking our orders but in 10 minutes she started to bring food and more food and more food...12 different plates with delicious variety of food.
Everything was bit strange and maybe a even too quick, but fun and all the food was clearly fresh and good!
Try it!,Thanks for the five-star recommendation, Andrea! We enjoyed welcoming in you and your friends. Whether you're hungry or simply craving delicious food, you're always in the best of hands with us. What plates did your waitress bring out for you and your friends?

We hope to welcome you back sometime soon! Thanks again, and take care.

"Recommended by Dylan's Tours, this was a real find.  It was a very casual restaurant but we left the choices to our server who brought out a great selection, working out at 22 dollars a head. It was our last evening in San Francisco and made the visit even more memorable.,It's flattering to hear that we made your trip to San Francisco a little more memorable, Heather! Good call letting your server pick out the selection. We think this makes the entire experience all the more special. Do you recall what plates you received?

"Enjoyed this restaurant very much.  Tables are all family style.  You'll get to know your neighbors.  The menu had many items that we'd never seen before.  We ordered two of them and they were both very good. Plus our neighbors gave us a taste of their meal - also excellent.  Service was very quick but in no way elegant.,Few things make me happier than hearing from a satisfied guest! Thank you so much for reviewing us, Joel. 

What dishes did you try? Any favorites?

"Born and bred New Yorker here who has been eating Chinese food since I started eating solids.  House of Nanking is a pretty typical Chinese restaurant based on my experience.  Nothing was amazing and nothing was bad.  The food was actually a bit salty and the cold sesame noodles did not have a ton of sesame flavor.  The eggplant and chow fun were a bit greasy and the sesame chicken with the sweet potatoes tasted like sesame chicken.  If I was in NY I would order from my local place over House of Nanking.,Hi there,

Ever since opening twenty years ago, we've enjoyed creating unique and flavorful dishes, so I was disappointed to hear that you weren't more impressed with our food.

We are always looking to perfect our cooking, and if you have a moment, would you mind explaining how you think the dishes could have been more enjoyable? Our kitchen appreciates your insight!

We'd encourage you to give us another chance the next time you're in town! Promise you won't be let down. Thank you for sharing, and take care.

"We ordered 3  dishes plus the pork egg rolls. The egg rolls were good and if you like meat then you would like these. I found them a little too heavy on the meat. The sesame chicken was the best out of our three dinners. The calamari was good just much smaller portion.  Overall good food with a lot of competition.,""No nonsense"" is right! The sesame chicken never fails to impress! Pleased that it managed to ""wow"" yet another guest. We want all of our plates to have a similar effect, so I'll tell our kitchen you thought the egg rolls were too heavy on the meat. 

Thanks for reviewing us, Roxane. As always, we appreciate your comments. The next time you're making the trip over from Florida, swing by!

"Initially the concept of this restaurant seemed a little disjointed but once settled in, we were able to appreciate the atmosphere. We came here on the recommendation of a taxi driver and it did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is rather small and on the night we visited it was busy so we had to share a table with another couple, although it was a long bench table so we didn't feel that we were intruding on their space. 
The staff seemed very rushed but once you were able to get their attention they were mostly helpful. We ordered a few dishes to share, as that seemed to be the go. Our food arrived in record breaking time and was unbelievably delicious! Not being a real fan of Asian cuisine I was very happy with my dishes. Overall, a great restaurant with super quick service and quirky atmosphere.,Thanks for stopping in! I'm happy to hear that your visit didn't disappoint. 

What dishes did you get a chance to try? I trust our kitchen will be flattered that we impressed someone who isn't a big fan of Asian cuisine to begin with. 

The next time you're visiting San Francisco, come by! We'd love to welcome you back. Thanks again, and take care.

"I've walked past this place a hundred times and thought...I don't like Chinese food, but there must be something special about this place, IT's ALWAYS CROWDED.  So Saturday I went:

Must be tourists....?

Curtly told, ""Yoo-oo WEIGH OUSIDE"". (I didn't realize the people standing on the side walk were in line)
Curtly told ""Yooooo Sit Dow Here""!  The tables are so close together you're sitting with people you don't know.  Not fun if you find them intrusive or ordinary.

Ordered the Hot and Sour soup.  It was a family sized bowl.  Flavorful, but not unique at all.  Just OK and lots of never ending soup between boring chunks of dry white chicken.

Slurped my room temp cola with a straw from the can, as I sat economy class, Virgin America style with an aloof vegetarian on my left and two touchy feel male masseuses on my right until my entree was slammed down in front of me.   

Enter the Nanking Chicken, ""special"" of the house.  YUK.  Deep-fried chicken nuggets with a ladle full of 1970's style sweet and sour sauce all over everything.  Chicken, Sweet potato chips and the cabbage.  You can't get away from the sweet and sour sauce because it's apparently the dish.

Had to get up as if jonesin' for an insulin shot, before I could get my check.  I don't think I'll go back unless they have Pandas on ice or something to trick me into the door...,Hi there,

Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be getting pandas anytime soon. But I'd still love it if you gave us another chance at some point to better represent ourselves. There's a reason why we're always crowded—let us show you why!  

If you have a moment, would you mind clarifying how you think the food could have been more enjoyable? We want to accommodate everyone's tastes, and I can assure you that I'll pass along your comments to our kitchen.

I look forward to hearing from you! Thank you for sharing, and take care.

"These guys know the definition of Chinese cuisine!! And hell yeah they know SPICE!!! Their House made noodles, Sesame chicken and fried onion pancakes are heavenly. I somehow prefer to eat in the restaurant, rather than bring the food home (only take out),""These guys know the definition of Chinese cuisine""—we certainly like to think we know a thing or two about good food! Thank you so much for the great review. We always enjoy welcoming you into our restaurant, and hope to see you soon.

"I've eaten here often since the 90's and I find that I reluctantly must now downgrade my opinion of HNK. The food used to be spectacular for the price but now it's just average. The sizzling rice soup was decidedly quiet and bland. The garlic fish was lacking garlic. The steamed pork dumplings saved the meal. 

Service was very slow but I confess we probably caught them at shift change. 

The real kicker was they forgot to bring the fried rice. I mentioned it to Peter (the owner) who simply shrugged citing the shift change Ten years ago, Peter would have personally solved the problem. Now, it's just my bad karma.

I'll go back only because I don't want to give up HNK but one more experience like this and that's it for me.,Hi Tracy,

I was concerned to read your review from last month, and apologize if you think our food has fallen flat. Ever since opening 27 years ago, we've been devoted to serving unique and flavorful dishes, and this commitment that has yet to change.

Perhaps even more importantly, we want to guarantee that our guests, new and old alike, always leave satisfied. With that in mind, I appreciate your feedback about the rice soup and garlic fish. I promise to share your remarks with our kitchen, as I know they'll value your insight. 

Like you hinted, slow and inattentive service is not typical for our team. Regardless of whether or not it was an ""off night"" for our servers, I'll make a point of checking in with them as well. 

If you have any further concerns, feel free to let us know. You can contact me directly at 415-421-1429. 

I hope you'll give us another chance. We'd love to win you over with excellent food and service all over again! Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and take care.

"Armed with only the recommendations of guide books and some online reviews my wife and I chose The House of Nanking for dinner on our first trip to San Francisco’s Chinatown.
When we got there at about 7:30 a short line had already formed which we joined.  We were only waiting about 5 min. and had just decided if it was going to be another ½ hr. wait like the Swan Oyster Depot we would go to our back up choice when a lady came out and asked if there was a party of 2 waiting.  Luckily we were the only party of 2 waiting so in we went.  
The restaurant is small inside and the tables are tightly packed in.  We were seated at a table by one of the front windows in a sort of cubby hole beside the front entrance.  It was kind of tight but turned out to be good because we didn’t have to deal with other conversations, chairs sliding back, waiters brushing past and the like.
One of the guide books said just ask the wait staff what’s good that evening, so we did.
We started with the Fried Pork Eggrolls which were excellent but I thought the sauce they were smothered in, though tasty overshadowed them.
For the mains we had Ginger Garlic Poached Scallops and Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken.
The scallops were the best Chinese dish I have ever had, really!  The scallops were done to perfection and the sauce was a perfect compliment.  I'm giving the fourth star on the strength of this dish alone.
The chicken however was another story.  It was moist and tender enough but it was just too salty.  Given the quality of the rest of the meal I would like to think my dish was the exception.
Even with the shortcomings I would definitely recommend giving The House of Nanking a try, if you don't have to wait too long to get in.,Glad that you and your wife decided to join us for dinner! Although it's great to hear that you enjoyed most of your food, I'll make sure to pass along your comments about the chicken and egg rolls to our kitchen. This is valuable insight, as we are always looking to perfect our cooking. Thank you for sharing your experience with others, and take care. Hopefully, we'll get the chance to welcome you back the next time you're visiting town!

"the meal was just ok. we did not get the value for the money we spent.  I would not visit again and would not recommend this chinese restaurant.,Hi Bill,

As a restaurant that aims to be better than average, I was disappointed to hear that you weren't more impressed with your food. Would you mind letting me know what you ordered? And how do you think it could have been more enjoyable? I promise to share your feedback with our kitchen!

Hopefully, you'll give us another chance the next time you're in San Francisco. Having become a favorite among locals and visitors alike, I know we can do better! Thank you for reviewing us last month, and take care.

"Not a good experience, I believe if this restaurant wasn't already ""famous"" and had to stand solely on its food and service it would be closed.  We had the pork potstickers and pork egg rolls to start.  Both were heavily battered and tasted strong fried oil taste.  The sauce on each was overly sweet.  The fried calamari was the best item in that it was fairly bland and the lemon was all there really was to taste.  Chow mein was overly sweet as well and very heavy.  Over all I'd rather have Panda Express which is a very sad thing to say about the most ""famous"" Chinese restaurant in one of the biggest China towns in the country.,I am sorry to hear that our Chinese food didn't live up to your expectations. Were you primarily dissatisfied with the taste of the food? Our pot-stickers and calamari are almost always a hit, but I'll make sure to share any feedback you have with our kitchen. 

There's a reason why we've garnered such a positive reputation, and I'd encourage you to give us another chance the next time you're in town. We like to think that our break from standard Chinese cooking has enabled us to stand-out as a restaurant, and the next time you're in town, let us know what you like and don't like, and we'll craft a unique dish just for you. You can't get that at Panda Express! Thanks for reviewing us last month, and take care.

"The service was surly and slipshod so although the food was good we did not enjoy the experience at all. We would not recommend this restaurant.,Hi Robert,

While I'm happy to hear you that enjoyed your meal, I apologize if were not as impressed with our staff. We understand how crucial quality service is, which is why we've sought to hire friendly and attentive servers. This type of behavior is not typical for us, and while it's no excuse, perhaps you caught us on an off night. 

Would you mind explaining your visit a bit further? Your words will aid us as we are always looking to improve.

"The service is very very poor. The servers are loud and overly rushed. They ignore  you and won't answer questions about the menu.The kitchen is dirty. Their primary interest is to get you in and out as quickly as possibly. The food is not the best Chinese food in Chinatown and definitely overrated. Not worth waiting in those long lines, go elsewhere."
"Very tastely and different chinese food - the owner just ordered for us and it was so surprisingly fun and great food,Ordering off the menu was the right thing to do! What did you have again?

"our tour guide suggested this restaurant and we were very happy with it.  The restaurant is cramped and not luxurious, but service is quick and the food is exciting to someone looking to try new flavors.  I had a simple meal of noodles and chicken, but the noodles were unlike any I had before and vegetable garnish provided unique flavor.  I would definitely revisit this restaurant.,We can't wait to welcome you back! I'm thrilled that delicious food and quick service could make your visit an enjoyable one.

"The lines are long, the service is poor, the food is OK.  The servers are overly rushed, won't answer your questions about the menu. Their primary interest is to get you in and out as quickly as possibly. Although the food is good it clearly is not the best Chinese food in Chinatown. Although not overpriced, it's definitely overrated. Not worth waiting in those long lines, go elsewhere."
"A character of a restaurant, let the server tell u what is good that day, have had better Chinese but loved the experience of the infamous nan king"
"I am embarrassed to admit that I actually ate at this restaurant.  The long line that you have to wait in before being seating gives off the impression that this is a quality place to eat. After eating here, I would suggest that the long lines have more to do with price than quality.
The House of Nanking is one of the filthiest establishments that I have ever dined at.  The dining room has supplies stacked 5-6 feet high.  Take a look in the kitchen and all you see is trash and trash bags everywhere.  It looks like they accumulate all of the days rubbish in the kitchen before removing it at the end of the day.
The food is another matter.  Personally, I am not fond of dishes that have one flavor.  All of the dishes provided to our party had a single taste, that being the taste of the sauce that the food was drowned in.  Maybe some people like this sort of dining, but for me I found it to be very plain and one dimensional.
The other aspect that I did not enjoy was how they deliver the food.  You do not get all of your selections together; they come one at a time.  So you end up eating all of a single item before having a chance to taste the next item.  Then, if you are like us, you will deliver the rice half way through the meal.
The service is rushed, the kitchen is filthy, the dining room is cramped and shared with supplies, and you have to wait in line to be seated.  I really do not understand why anyone rates this place so high unless they primarily consider the price."
"Come early cause there will be a line. I came at 5pm with a party of 4 and was seated right away. No reason to look over the menu. just tell them you have never been there before and they will order for you! They will start out with delicious floral ice teas and some appetizers, then bring out 3 different main courses and a couple desserts! Im definately glad we let them take care of the menu for us plus the bill came out to under 100 bucks for 4 people. Cant beat it!"
"cozy (or crowded), I got the sesame chicken but the people next to us got something that looked much better with lots of veggies.  We clearly ordered wrong - although it was delicious, no veggies. so be sure to brows the entire menu."
We were there on a Wed. night and the place was packed.  After a short wait we were shown to a table.  Servce was a bit brusk.  Not a huge menu (a plus in my experience).  Spicy chicken was excellent.  Authentic Chinese.
We were in San Francisco for only 3 days and ate there twice. Kids loved it. I wouldn't enter the place if not adviced. But the food was delicious and prices were very acceptale. Our favourite was shrimps with mushrooms.
"This was definitely the best meal we had in San Francisco. We got there about 6:30 and got the last table in the restaurant. Moments later a queue had appeared, which shows had good this place is. The sesame chicken is fantastic and the beef dish we had was pretty good too. So glad I spotted this place in a guide book."
Ate here based on hotel desk recommendation. Great food. Be prepared to share a table the place was packed. Well worth it.
"Maybe the food was good, but I couldn't get the smell of urine eminating from the direction of the bathroom out of my mind.  If it smelled so bad outside, what was it like in the bathroom itself?  How clean are the employee's hands after visiting?  How clean is the kitchen where they are preparing my food.  No thanks."
"My third time, and it always seems to get better.  They are famous for having a gruff wait staff -- all you need to do is order what the chef wants to bring and you are set.  The shrimp with crispy rice is the best of the genre.  I love this place!"
"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 25 years, ever since they only had about 5 tables and a counter. As good and popular as ever. Yesterday the waitress came to our table and asked if she just wanted them to take care of the menu and take care of us. She asked if there was anything we didn't like or if we had any allergies and then proceeded to bring out four outstanding dishes. 

This place is not fancy, it is crowded and you usually have to wait in a line running down the sidewalk but it is worth the wait."
"We waited in a queue ( with our two young daughters ) for an hour on a cool night, but it was worth it. 

Staff are a bit surly and detached, but the servce is efficient, the mood chaotic and the food just great. Eat and go seems to be the message the Nanking team are sending, so we did just that.

Well worth another visit."
"I love the melt in your mouth calamari. That dish really lives up to its name, literally. 

If you're Chinese, talk to them in mandarin/ cantonese for special recommendations of dishes cooked to suit your flavour. They have a special menu for the non-Americanized Chinese food which is way better than the dishes in the usual menu.

The only down side is that they dont take reservations and it can get really crowded, so go early and wait in line!"
"At the end of Chinatown just around the corner from North Beach sits this very busy restaurant.  The menu is simple, one chicken dish, one fish dish, one beef etc... It's a small menu than regular Chinese joints.  You sit down and right away they want your oder.  They give you a bowl and a fork.  The food is good (small menu means they can perfect each dish), it comes out fast with whatever is ready first which can be a good thing or a bad thing, my fish dish came out quick (I think it was sitting out for a while waiting for someone to order it) and my rice came many minutes later so the fish just got colder and colder.  The pea shoots were some of the best I've had, make sure to order those. They have chop sticks, you just have to ask."
"We have been in this small place several times during the past decade. Our last visit was very disappointing. In spite of some decoration improvements not really necessary, we ate a cuisine which was not chinese any more. We had to ask for chop sticks ...and the food taste more american than chinese : soup not spicy, dimsungs too big and greasy, shrimp and mushrooms tasteless...let's hope it is an accident and not the result of too much publicity in guidebooks. By the way, all of thé clients were western foreigners, Chinese see not to come anymore."
"My husband and i were wandering around chinatown trying to decide on a place to eat when a business from Chicago approached us and told us about this place. He was right, it is the best food ever. Very crowded and noisy so ambiance is not number 1 but the excellent food is why you come here."
"We heard that Bill Clinton used to eat there when he was in San Francisco, so thought it worth a try.  I thought it was good but not better than most Chinese restaurants I've been to.  Easy to get to location.  The service was very good.  Nothing fancy here and there's very little space between diners.  Still it was interesting and inexpensive, so if that's what you're looking for, I recommend it."
Short wait. Crammed into table. Served lukewarm soda in a can. Calamari was flavorless. Hot and sour soup smelled like sewer water. They sprinkled hot sauce on top I guess to make it hot. Shrimp packets should be called pea packets as there were more peas then shrimp. Sesame chicken was fried with more reading than chicken. Would skip.
"Had the beat calamari -lightly fried with a semi-sweet sauce. The sesame chicken was crispy and tender with a great sauce. We also tried the fried eggplant with black bean, chili sauce which was awesome. not a huge menu so easy to decide. Everything I saw at other tables also looked amazing. Loved it!!!  I have to mention that it is a cramped space and very noisy but the food is worth it."
The House of Nanking was recommended to us by a tourbus guide.  We got there before the rush (people line up outside to get in).  There was limited seating and the interior was nothing fancy - a little dark and cramped. But the food was excellent!  We ordered 4 difference entres with an appetizer and all were great.  The food was very fresh and the flavors superb.  Definately worth visiting!
"was flicking through my old photos of a cross country trip to the usa 14 years ago..looked up on tripadvisor to see whether house of nanking is as good now as it was then and it looks like from the reviews it is!!! the point of the review, even though i visited a very long time ago,is to point out that  i can honestly say that this one of the very best restaurants i have ever been to and i have been to a lot ! If food, ambiance, authenticity is more important to you than pomp and ceremony and the cost  this is the place for you, queue up its worth it..even if you go on your own. cant wait to go back...."
"Staff is all business, charged for refills, they brought us 2 items we never ordered but they weren't paying much attention while taking our order either... its a crowded little place, food wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to the hype of our bus guide."
The food is fresh and oh so tasty. Seating is community style so if you are in a smaller party you will be sharing the table with strangers. We ordered four different entrees and two appetizers and between the four of us were stuffed to the gills. Service is friendly. I recommend sharing the food so you get to taste different items. Lines do form in the dinner rush hour so get there early. Loved it! Would totally go back next time I'm in SF!
"We wanted Chinese food as it's lacking in our community and EVERYONE recommended this one.  There was a line waiting on the street but it moved quickly.  It was very casual and elbow to elbow.  We shared a table with 4 other people.  Friendly, fairy quick and tasty food.  A must go place in San Fran"
"We are here on the recommendation of a SF native. We waited in line for about 30 minutes, but the food was worth the wait."
"Forget comfort and fawning service because you won't get much of either here but the food is good and reasonably priced, the athmosphee is lively and the overall experience definitely makes a visit worthwhile.  Just relax and enjoy it."
"The food is good - the atmosphere is kitschy.  This is clearly a place to go for the experience.  The food is very tasty, the staff is sometimes impatient and short - but I got the idea that this was part of the experience.  They only take cash so come prepared."
"We waited in line about 35 minutes.  It moves quickly.  Don't go here if you want atmosphere but the food is worth not having that.   We shared a table with two other people.  We were not sure what to order so the owner asked us what we like and she brought four selections for us.  Everything was great.  The crackling shrimp was my favorite.  Also get the sesame chicken, and these beef things that you wrap up in a tortilla of some kind.  Fried rice was very good."
"I went to House of Nanking after reading rave reviews. They specialise in telling their clients what to eat and also have decent selection of vegetarian fare. They also have a seating arrangement where tables are shared with strangers.

We arrived and told them that we were vegetarians and they said they will take care. They sent fried rice and tofu (in garlic sauce)  and egg plant (also in garlic sauce). No greens were served.

Overall the dishes were of single ingredient and therefore no fun to eat. Service was ok and food taste was not so good. Have eaten in much better restaurants."
"The food is delicious, no doubt about it. We enjoyed all of it. But the service, from start to finish was about as bad as I can remember. I'm not one to expect stellar service in low-end Chinese restaurants, but this was really bad. Waitress came over, started to take our order, then walked away while I was in mid-sentence. One dish arrived, then nothing for about 10 minutes. In that time, a table that sat after us got all their food. Did they drop the ticket behind the fryer? No idea. We ordered white rice. It never came. Yet, it was on our tab. If you can stand the lousy service, go for the food."
"We went here while visiting in May. On the hotel's recommendation we went, stood in a massive line and were rushed in, and rushed out. Food was so-so.  The waitress brought us two beers when I had asked for one and then tried to charge us for two because ""she opened them both"". They also tried to overcharge us the menu price.  I would opt for a different restaurant on my next visit."
I would definitely would recommend R and G Lounge down the block. The House of Nanking was OK but the service was rough and I didn't think their establishment was clean. Maybe our family was looking for a different type of experience- sorry
"I had a memorable meal here in 2001, just before leaving San Francisco for good. The highlight was a wonderful, flavorsome thick broth with egg, zucchini and fried meat.

In the last 11 years I forgot many things, but not that meal. So I had been checking the web from time to time to see whether the restaurant still existed.

In July I finally went back to SF and I had no doubt where to have my first meal.

The thick broth is still on the menu (""chinese chowder"") and is still delicious. There are a lot of other inviting dishes, including excellent vegetable noodles, onion tart and filled mushrooms. 

We went there at 330pm and immediately found a table. The location is warmly inviting; service can be a bit blunt but we enjoyed it. I looked around and everybody seemed to enjoy the food and have a good time. I have been reading about long lines, but we witnessed none. Perhaps is the time of the day, or of the year.

House of Nanking: thanks for being there and for keeping my chowder warm and tasty. I will be back before eleven years next time!"
"We first ate here in 1988, just after it opened. The owner came out onto the street & invited us to dine at his new restaurant. He'd only recently arrived from mainland China, where we'd been a few months earlier. We offered him $20 to feed us, which he promptly did. I remember the prawns in Tsingtao beer dish was very good. Every time we're in the city we eat here. This is not a posh, dine at leisure place. It's an authentic Chinese restaurant such as one finds in China. The waiters all rush about taking orders & delivering food & drink, clearing tables & you KNOW the food will have been freshly prepared. This is good, tasty, nourishing food at very good value. You'll probably have to queue..."
"This is one of the iconic spots for Chinese food in the city and in my opinion not worth waiting in a huge line for at dinner time with the equally excellent Chef Jia's right next door.  That being said, this is an awesome place to grab lunch.  Especially if you hit them before noon, you're usually one of only a few people in the whole restaurant.  If you tell the waiter what you like, they'll just dream up a dish for you, which I recommend rather than ordering off the menu.  I've done it the past 2 times I've been and both times have had something unique which I've never seen out of a Chinese kitchen before.  I agree with other reviewers on the services, it is lackadaisical at best, but I can look past that for a delicious lunch."
"I will acknowledge that other reviewers have had bad or rushed service here. Fortunately, the service for us was neither bad or rushed.  I would say they make efficient use of the open tables they have.  We ordered the same entree, Lemon Chicken.  It was very good.  About the only thing was that it could have had more sauce with it.  We ordered the wonton soup to start with.  Now, that was definitely different from wonton soup you order back home.  The broth looked like it was cream based rather than broth.  It also appeared to have rice in it.  It was different but good as well.  The dinner portion was too much for me.  The other interesting thing about the meal was that they included sweet potato with the entree.  Never seen that on a Chinese restaurant menu.  The one negative was that the server asked us if we wanted rice.  When I got the check later, I realized they charged me for it.  The restaurants back home don't.  There are better choices to be sure.  But, if you are on Kearny St, this place is all right."
"Really loved this place, just stopped for a couple quick apps including the egg rolls which were crazy awesome.  If you find yourself in little china any time soon, make sure and stop by."
"I've been a frequent dinner at House of Nanking for decades, and have seen it evolve from a dingy hole in the wall to a less unglamorous hole in the wall with more tables. The flavors of the food are outstanding -- the Nanking Chicken is to die for.  Even though the menu is quite limited, taking advice from the waiters is usually wise. It's rudimentary service in a rather spartan environment and not a place for leisurely dining. Yet I love it, although some of the out of town guests I've brought with me are aghast at how quickly we are in and out -- it often takes longer to wait on line to get in then you spend at the table."
Poor service/  Unclean / used to be a fun place to go to when out/about.  No longer.
"Liked:
Tell them what you want & you'll receive it.
Disliked:
Service was very poor, no one smiles, no one says thank you. They're in a constant rush to get you fed & bring in the next patron."
Definitely not worth the wait on the long line I should of went around the corner to the hunan house
The food is average to above average but the experience of waiting in line and getting yelled at by the Chinese Aunties makes the overall experience a good one. You can tell them you have never been there before and they will serve you a variety of dishes (but beware you can end up spending more money than you want unless you tell them a budget first).
"Be ready to wait in line outside, and don't expect a nice or patient server!  The food was really good.  We ordered the Melt in Your Mouth Calamari (AND IT WAS), Pot-stickers (Very good), Pork stuffed Mushrooms (Very good), and the famous Sesame Chicken (Best I've ever had--SO Crispy!).  The place is very crowded and noisy, and you had better hurry up and finish and get out LOL.  We never received our fried rice, and were afraid to ask for it.  Oh, I had some cool blossoming tea, I was as much fascinated with watching it as I was with the food.  I would maybe eat here again, but probably would try some of the other places first."
"Generally good flavor.  Had to wait 45 minutes.  Not worth the wait.

The Good:
Potstickers
Egg roll
Sesame chicken

The Bad:
Calumari (advertised as melt in your mouth, but not so much)
Hot And Sour Soup (so vinegary it was inedible)"
"We went to this place upon the recommendation of our hotel concierge.  He was right on - it was fabulous!  The menu is great and dishes are large enough to share.  We had the potstickers (best we've EVER had), the fried rice, sesame chicken and sweet and sour pork.  Everything was fabulous and there were leftovers.  If we had just been walking down the street, we probably would have walked on by - so glad we didn't!"
The food was over average interesting and tasty but service and and atmosphere was appalling. Very busy and the waiters were unfriendly and stressed. No chopsticks didn't exactly improve our impression of the place. Got the bill on the table by a waiter running passed us... paid quickly and left... and see no reason to come back!
"Ate here years ago and loved it. My husband also, so we were prepared to dig in! Waiters were not helpful or pleasant. Food was marginal. The place has lost its luster. Funky atmosphere does not make up for lack of the great food they used to serve here. Lackluster sizzling rice soup. Onion cake with the same over sweetened sauce as was served on the hard and heavy pot stickers. Beef with pancakes and plum sauce with so much gristle that we could not eat at least a quarter of the dish. We will not be back. So sad that lost the golden touch they formerly had."
"The doorman at our hotel told us about this place, and we had heard about it from several friends who had eaten here.  The ravings were correct!  The food was reasonably priced, and really good!  We knew what we wanted, but the table next to us was curious about trying an appetizer, and the waitor told them if they didn't like it, they didn't have to pay for it.  They loved it, but I thought it was amazing that he offered that.    This is definitely on our list of places to eat every time we are San Francisco!"
"I had a great meal here in 2007 and was excited to come back. It's still the same busy place with good food and generous portions. It's also still a bit of a hole in the wall, which is surprising given how much $$ these guys are making! 

I'll be back."
"As soon as we sat down a server asked us for our order. It was our first time there. The servers were pushy the entire time, but when we needed things like water refills we had to ask at least three times. The food was good (sesame chix ok, eggplant in garlic sauce good, garlic fish great), but service was really lacking. They also pack ppl in like sardines there. Quite crowded."
This Chinese style restaurant was recommended to us by someone in Seattle who said go very early. Within 30 minutes fo opening the restaurant was 50% full with space between people sitting at large tables.  We enjoyed our food and thought the service and the price were reasonable.  We would recommend it to other people visiting San Francisco who want a quick casual and tasty meal.
"Had been planning to go to the restaurant next door (on the right) do to better reviews, but I wanted to look at the menu and get an idea of the wait time as there was a line out the door.  The ""greeter"" was extremely rude, and after briefly looking at the menu I left and went next door and had the best Chinese food of my life.  DANGER - Seems like a tourist trap."
"If there is a category for ZERO circles, this is where H of Nanking should belong!

1.  They have no system for the poor costumers waiting outside in the cold weather.  It does n't matter if you came in first or last ... it was a looonngggg line when we came, the old lady shouted : ""we need two people, only two available""  the lucky two people who just got in line, got in before all those people who were in group of 3's (or more than 3)  and had been waiting for a looongggg time.

2.The place is tiny and too cramped.  Be prepared to get bumpled while you are eating.

3.  Do not order the pork wanton soup.  It's disgusting!   The pork wanton is like the ones you buy from Cotsco or any supermarket that was heated up.  The soup is milky white  with rice crispies and some cilantro.  This is not the pork wanton soup that you usually get from other Asian restaurants.  

4.  Do not get the House's fried rice.  It's too greasy, it's full of scrambled eggs and I bet all the left over vegetables were put in it.  One can taste the overpowering sesame oil.

5.  Do not get the pan fried pork chop!  We were almost  done with our half eaten meal when it came.  I went twice to the counter to remind them about that order.  The pork chop is too bland.  It is like a stir fried pork chop with a little bit of soy sauce and the chef forgot to put the 5 spices or the sesame or the proper seasoning to make it taste like an asian pan fried pork chop.  It is like a pork chop that was not properly marinated at all.

6.  Do not order the blossoming flower tea.  If you want something like that go to a tea store, you can buy that at a cheaper price.  Nothing spectacular about it.  

7.   The glasses were dirty.  I ordered that blossoming tea, it was served in a beer mug.  The rim of the mug has some residue on it. ---- yuck!

8.  My daughter ordered a coke.  They gave the coke in a can, and did not give any straw nor glass with ice.

9.   The people were not very friendly.  They never asked if everything was okay nor came back to check if the costumers needed something.  A person will only come to look and check who's table is about to be vacant.

10. They sat us with other people.  You can smell that the stir fried vegetables with overpowering garlic that our ""seatmates"" ordered.  Everything that has garlic, smelled like the dish was just laced with too much garlic --- nothing special about it nor worth the price.  You can go home sauted the garlic in sesame oil and stir in your favorite vegetable, meat or fish.

11.  The staff are in a hurry to get rid of the customers and take in new customers that I bet they don't have time to prepare the food well.

12.  It stinks!  It doesn't smell like the typical asian chinese restaurant.

I was so disappointed that I told my husband, do not give any tip... however my husband gave only half of the 15%.  I wrote on the receipt that I was disappointed with their food and service -- and will never come back again and will never recommend it to my friends and will write a review about them.  I even took pictures of the food they served us.

After we left the place, we went to another chinese restaurant and ate again since we could not eat what we ordered from H of N!

I am an asian, I know it when it's a good asian cooking or not.  I asked my husband  (who is a caucasian, natural born American) if I was being overly critical about the food, he also agreed it was the worst asian food he had ever eaten, he said our friendly neighborhood chinese take away's better!  

This is definitely a tourist trap!  Don't even ask why it is not listed in the top ten recommended places to eat in Chinatown.  Do'nt be fooled by the loong line of poor unfortunate costumers thinking that this is a good place to eat.  Somebody said this is Zagat Rated.  Zagat never failed me, but if they really rated this, may be they made a mistake."
"Yesterday's rice reheated with lumps, their ""wrap"" was a Mexican flour tortilla (we kid you not), and over all bland, mediocre fare with little respect for the food. The rave reviews for this place must be from those that have never had fresh, flavorful Chinese food before...it's all we can figure. You have been warned: In a food town as great as S.F., it's just a crime to settle for this crap."
"Our family's first trip to SF and were lucky to get the last table here at lunchtime.  Even our picky 14 year old son who doesn't like a lot loved everything we got here - egg rolls, sesame chicken (amazing!), fried rice, dumplings. All terrific! The food comes out as it finishes in the kitchen so it's more like a series of courses,  But all are fresh, authentic and delicious!"
"If you are the first timer, you will love this place. When it was a single-room restaurant (a few years back,) patrons had lined up to get in for dinner. Now-a-day, you don't have to line up very often if you go on regular weeknight.

When you go there, don't order from the menu. Talk to the owner (an elder gentleman) about your taste bud and preference and let him order for you. Most of the orders would be on target and awesome in both taste and quality. I had not ordered from the menu for a long-time, and the man had never let me down with his choice of foods and style (some are not on the menu.)

One advise, the food are very rich in term of taste and quality so you may want to bring the beer/wine to heighten your tastebud."
"Loved the food. Dumplings were the best I've ever had. The service was not so great, but I think that's supposed to be part of the charm. Go here!!"
"When I researched places to eat in Chinatown, everything pointed to the House of Nanking as THE place to go. The major drawback to the restaurant was that the wait time for a table is consistently 1.5 hours or more. I don't know if we hit a great day or if the fact that we arrived between 5:00-5:30 on a Tuesday helped, but we walked right in off the street, with a party of 9. By the time we finished our meal, every table was filled, but even at 6:30, there was no line outside.

The food was, as advertised--extremely good. The sesame chicken was amazing. The fried rice, a meal in itself, was the best that I've ever had. The portions of everything we ordered (from pot stickers to noodles to salt and pepper shrimp) were enough to share and still satisfy.

The wait staff was brusque. And the woman who took our order was not helpful at all in trying to figure out what on the menu was closest to the kind of noodles some of our friends' kids like. She actually made the whole ordering process more hectic and nerve-wracking than necessary. But if you can stomach the wait staff, your stomach will thank you later."
"Nothing special...was really hoping to find authentic Chinese, and this was just mostly typical American dishes.  Service was fast - won't be friendly but that is expected so no problem there - very efficient.  Can't compare to any other Chinese in SF, but was just OK.  Next time will find dim sum and more authentic Chinese."
"If you are in the mood for relatively inexpensive Chinese food, this is the spot. Beware, it is packed and not the most romantic locale. Part of its charm is the outdated interior. The staff is too busy to be overly friendly. Food is served quickly. No Chinese patrons in sight at this restaurant in Chinatown."
We were recommended this restaurant in china town by a hotel staff member and we were not disappointed.  It's a place the locals frequent and is extremely busy so be prepared to sit with someone and make new friends.  We ate with a local lady who gave us hot tips on what to order and everything we ate was delicious.  Very good value for money.
"The reviews rave about the food but I don't see why. The owner took our order and was quite gracious but the rest of the staff were below par and one lady was rude, whether she meant to be or not. Ordered crispy noodle stack and was pleased with the flavor and sautéed veggie mix included along with the wonderfully flavored pork. Well worth the price.  The hot and sour soup was full of vinegar to the point of being not edible. They just bring rice out even though you don't ask for it or isn't required and then charge you .75 per person, which is a practice they should stop. I like the community seating and would think about coming back if they did a better job with service, fine tuned their menu and didn't charge for white rice"
"The first thing people will notice about this restaurant is the long line to go in stretching out the door and down the block.  Fortunately, the line moves fast.  The food is every bit worth the wait.  Typicically people do not order dishes, they ask for a particular type of meat or vegetable and allow the chefs to improvise.  You will savor every morsel of whatever concoction the chefs come up with for that particular meal, even of its something you wouldn't normally like.  It's that good, the flavor, the texture, the sauces and everything else.  I have no idea how they cook there food but they seem to have some kind of magic touch.  Try this restaurant and you'll know exactly what I mean."
"House of Nanking was recommended by the city tour bus.  We thoroughly enjoyed starters and mains.  

Service was below average.  Mains were placed on the table as I finished my starters which wasn't great.  There was then a clear indication that they wanted the table for their next customer.  I'm not a regular with Chinese dining but after talking to friends I understand this is common behavior (eat and leave). 

Good food and below average service I have to give this 3/5."
When we entered the place we thought it would be a fun place. But if you  want some okay greasy Chinese food then this is the place. We ordered Seaseme Chicken and Mushroom dish. Chicken was on the sweeter side with lots of oil. Mushrooms were very bland with no flavor. It is very small space and and you share the tables  with other people which was fine but if you are in the corner seat you have to make other 2 people get off their seat in the middle of their meal if you want to go to the bathroom or leave. If you want to go to a tourist place then go there but don't go for real good Chinese food.
"After finishing our first day of the conference, 18 of us decided to dine at the House of Nanking. It's not a big place at all so we felt bad about not making a reservation and taking up three tables. The owner and other waiting staff were very kind. The owner came to our table and asked for all the menus to be passed to him. He asked if anyone had dietary restrictions. After writing the restrictions down, he said he would send several things for us to eat. We had the ribs, sautéed mushrooms, chicken w/beans, and a lightly breaded fish. It was a really good meal. 

We got there around 6pm and there was no line. When we walked out, there were about 10 people in line. It is worth a visit."
"Pros:
-Decent prices for Chinese food
-Kind of a fun, albeit, random experience - it's super crowded - everyone is on top of each other - so if you want something a little different from that standpoint, it might be worth trying

Cons:
-Cash only
-Seating is tough to figure out if it's your first time - basically you wait in the line that lines up outside along the window, but I'd recommend still popping your head in, as we did both (husband went inside, and I waited outside) and since we were only two people they seated us immediately.  Apparently they take reservations, but I have no idea how they'd control it, so unless you're a large party, I'd be a little leery of the reservations holding true.
-Found the food just okay (and we've had both authentic and American Chinese food and have traveled to China).  We ordered the sesame chicken, the house noodles, and shrimp/mushroom stir fry.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing was that special, and we've had better in the states.  Also, I'd recommend family style if you are okay with it - dishes won't come out together, so it's best if you can all just start eating the dishes as they come out.
-Service was awful, although as soon as I walked in, I expected it (typical hole in the wall kinda place).  We didn't really leave a tip - just rounded up.  Also, don't be afraid to shout or wave your hands vigorously to get someone's attention if you need to.  

We don't live in SF - and when we visit next, we won't go back here for Chinese.  Even though the service was bad, I didn't mind it.  If the food was really great, we'd go back regardless of the service, but we just didn't think it was that special.  To each their own..."
This is the best chineese food in SF! You must try it!
"Unlike other Chinatown restaurants, the food at House of Nanking is fresh and inventive. I had their house noodles with vegetables and tofu; my husband had the broccoli with black bean sauce. Both dishes had a lot of flavor without the heaviness of some Asian-American food. The restaurant is small and crowded, the service is abrupt, and they only take cash, but the food is worth it."
We had to queue for half an hour to enter and it was really basic ambient but our waitress knew what to suggest and the food was the best Chinese I had outside China.
"Although the ingredients appeared fresh and thoughtfully prepared, I was disappointed with the final product.  The 3 of us had 5 dishes recommended by the chef but only one stood out (chicken and long beans in a black bean sauce - excellent) while the others were about average.  On the whole, too cloyingly sweet; not my idea of good chinese, and at $84 (before tip and modest portions), overpriced!  Service was brusque.  Cash only!"
"Not much ambience, but the food is out of this world. Best place in Chinatown (well kind of on the edge of Chinatown). This might not be a first date or romantic evening kind of place, but makes a great lunch spot."
This is a hidden gem. We would never have noticed it if it hadn't been recommended to us. A very basic restaurant but excellent food at great prices. The sesame chicken is fantastic! Clearly a favourite with the locals.
"This is a great chinese restaurant. Simple and tasty! I went with my wife. We told the waiter that we usually like to have shrimp, chicken and fried rice. He said: ""leave it with me"". He brought us shrimp with murshroom, which was really good! Then he brought a sweet chicken, which were tasty. Fried rice was also very good. I recommend this place to everyone."
"My friends in SF told me we were going to the Soup Nazi restaurant with an Asian twist... pretty spot on.  If you're going, a heads up, there's no wait list.  You stand outside the door and wait until they come yell at you to come in.  With prep, I thought it was fun.  Had I not known beforehand, I would have just left.  This place has lots of character, and a gorgeous mixed crowd.  Very popular.  My food wasn't the best, but it was a fun place to go to with my friends, and my waitress was super cute!"
"This place was wonderful!  Our server came over and asked if we had been before, and when we said no - offered to just feed us! (Apparently that is the norm there, because we overheard another table ask the server if they could ""just do that thing where you bring us food!"" )

That is the way to do it!  There were three of us and the server asked for any allergies/preferences   and how hungry we were then brought us amazing food!  He brought potstickers, sesame chicken, calamari, and at least two other dishes.  It was all delicious and was the perfect amount.  The price was very reasonable considering how much food we got to sample."
"February 2010. We visited SF for Valentine's weekend and were determined to get to some good food spots. We heard about The House of Nanking and gave it a try without knowing anything about it. We walked through China Town thinking that most of the places looked dirty or untrustworthy. Comparably, House of Nanking was perfect for us.

People with smaller numbers got in first. With two of us it took about half hour on a Saturday, the day before Valentine's Day around 8pm, too. The line wrapped around onto itself though, and we weren't really sure what we were doing here anyway, so we weren't bothered. We were seated at an 8 person table, thankfully on the end. The couple next to us was in between strangers and I wouldn't really be happy with that, and they didn't really seem to enjoy their meal despite having discussed dining there before (see how weird it was to sit at the same table with strangers?). We were able to have an easy conversation through the noisy atmosphere, but this probably wouldn't be a good place for people who want a quiet, romantic, or personal dining experience.

We went the safe route and looked around and saw what everyone was eating. Everyone had the onion cakes so we ordered them with hot and sour chicken soup. Both dishes were really good. The soup was hot, peppery, and hit the spot. The onion cakes were new to us, but really good. Plenty of food for appetizers and it was lucky we were hungry and ate fast enough to get some dishes out of our way, otherwise our small table would have been awfully cramped. We got the sesame chicken for the main course and it was fine. Nothing special there.

One of the best parts of the meal was my drink. I actually really enjoyed the ice cold detoxifying tea that came with fruit in it, although my then-girlfriend didn't.

For two people the meal was about $35-$40, which was fine for us, but might not be for others. Looking back, this was a great price for SF.

I don't know if we'd come back here regularly, but I'd recommend it to people wanting an easy meal near China Town. I'll go back when we go back to SF."
"We were recommended to eat at House of Nanking by our taxi driver. On Friday night place was really busy but managed to get the table without waiting. The menu is small and we decided to go for sesame chicken and crispy rice noodle tower with pork- both dishes were amazing. Portions are really big, so if you are not very hungry just order one dish and share!

Staff was friendly and made sure we were happy with our order."
"Small menu choices, more contemporary type Chinese dishes. Very crowded and noisy, quick service. What we ate was excellent."
"heard about this place and decided to try it since we were so close. First of all, we asked for water while we looked at the menu, and we got water in yucky plastic glasses with no ice and no straws. We asked for both, but only got the straws. Then we were rudely informed, ""today is 'cash only'"". Ok... one of the things we heard is that the ""chef"" will come to your table and suggest things based on what you tell him you like. So we ordered chicken curry without veggies and fried rice. We got chicken curry WITH veggies, so we sent it back. They brought it back w/out the veggies, but still no rice.  Finally, the rice arrived, but it was not fried rice.  This was just not a good experience.  Rude service, bad food ... I couldn't wait to get out of there.  Should have gone with my gut feeling."
"very good food just to start off.we were going to get our food but the waiter ordered for us and it was GREAT!we will defineyly come back!

its kind of a ""hole in the wall"" place.we talked to our bus driver who told us about here.

not a tourist trap so we do recommend and its very fun.its not formal but its fun to watch everything. 

clearly its very good and you should try it!"
"The food is why you are here and will be back. You can choose from some traditional items, I recommend being adventurous. They will also help you pick based on likes and dislikes. 
The owner Peter Fang when there will gladly take your menu away and just start bringing sharing dishes, but remember to tell him to stop. We discovered some great dishes not on the menu this way.  Try his salad with tomatoes and greens, little crunchy rice bits - no idea what it's called ( meat can be added too ). Also, the spicy shrimp with green beans in a creamy sauce.  My other favorite is his pan fried garlic fish.
From flavorful teas to very reasonably priced wine and beer will complement your food.
Atmosphere? No, it's crowded, close tables, last time my girlfriend just climbed over the chair to get into the corner table. The sister restaurant Fang is laid out less crowded and a better atmosphere ( same great food ). 
Service? Sometimes much better, sometimes not. This does not keep me away. They will bring you chop sticks if you like, but might have to ask more than once.
Remember, you are there for the food.
If you choose to have them bring several courses, it can start to add up, but overall fairly priced.  My girlfriend and I shared the shrimp green bean and wine for about $25."
"It was recommended by hotel front desk.  The place was not crowded when we went around 5pm on Friday.  The menu was not big but everything on it sounded very good.  Looking around what people were eating we decided to order sweet and sour soup, sesame chicken, fried rice and some kind of pork wrap.  They were all delicious.  I had a cup of fruit tea as well and it was sooo gooood."
"Arrived with a large group of 16, we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Let the owner choose 8 dishes plus Hot & Sour Soup. Everything was great, we were served fast and we loved it all."
"Don't bother ordering off the menu.  Chef will come out of the kitchen, ask you what you like in general, then just go to kitchen and make something up for you.  THE. BEST. CHINESE. FOOD. EVER."
"A go-to spot for authentic Chinese.  Used to be that it was unknown, but now the tourists line up.  Don't ask ""what's good"" cause they will scowl at you and tell you ""everything's good, what do you want!"""
"We knew before going that the place tries to get people in and out asap. Usually there is a line but we went on a rainy night so I guess no one wanted to stand in the rain. We were able  to get seated in about 5 minutes. There were people getting up from a table and the staff practically pushed them out the door to seat us. Don't go here for service or a leisurely dinner-the upside is you get your food pretty quick. We actually found the abrupt service somewhat amusing but again, we expected that before going in. The food was excellent-worth it for the food for sure."
"Tried Nankng again after being grossed out by the stacks of dirty dishes behind the front counter many years ago. The front of the restaurant and the dining area has been remodelled and it looks much better. Ordered the house sesame chicken, found it crispy if unremarkable, but it came with a big slick of oil. Service was pleasant enough. Not sure why the restroom was lit by a 5 watt bulb except to keep thing dark, same for the kitchen ...couldn't help but think of a gulag, These signs bothered me and I'm accustomed to similar restaurants in NYC but they're not hyped as this place is/used to be. Not sure if there are lines for this place anymore since I went at 3 in the atfernoon. So without a big payoff in terms of food, keep walking,"
After considering where to eat lunch we chose the House of Nanking.  We had called my husband who found it rated hight on trip advisor and my daughter's husband ate here and highly recommended it.  The food was excellent.  We had the sesime chicken which came with the best sliced sweet potatoes I have had.   The chicken was delicious.   Many people from the financial district were eating there.   Our server was not the friendliest but we went there for the food and not for the staff.   I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area.
The Wonton Soup was unique and delicious. The place is small and you may be seated with others. It was reasonably priced.
"Our go to place for Chinese in San Fransisco. If Mr. Fang is in house I suggest you ask him to just feed you, please note any ""don'ts"" (for me, cilantro and chicken) and you will be amazed. The crispy rice soup, shrimp packets, dumplings, sweet & sour (no longer on menu, ask for this dish) noodles, and I'm just picking out stuff I love. My husband gets far more adventurous than me. Service can be a bit slow but they don't make you wait to get a table until they catch up, I'm sure they would let you wait on the curb if you need instant attention when you sit down."
"This was our day two search for great chinese. Look at the reviews, most people say it's good. Our experience was not. We went at lunch. Not crowded at all. No one said a dang word. Pretty standard for the chinese restaurants there in China Town. We have decided that maybe they think they do not have to bother with any of those dang pleasantries to keep a good business. That's fine if the food is great and all that. We ordered their famous Sesame Chicken. Whatever. It's a plate of sweet potato with a couple of pieces of chicken. They offer bottles of wine, and glasses. If you order a glass, it is sucky boxed wine. At least it's not too expensive. Then we decided to order the steamed dumplings and there was a black hair in our food. The atmosphere sucked. They store cases of soda in the restaurant. I would not go back and do not recommend. I snapped a great picture of our horrible waiter leaning on the cases of crap nest to the table. Right behind him are the t-shirts you can buy."
"Despite a line of at least 15 people waiting outside the restaurant door, we were all in and seated within 15 minutes.  This is a crowded, casual, loud restaurant where you may be seated with more than just your party.  If you don't mind being a little cramped, you'll be pleased with the speed of service and quality of food... prices were reasonable for the City too.  We loved it!"
"I've heard about House of Nanking for years, and finally got to visit with my husband & about 8 of his colleagues. This is the sort of restaurant that's far better with a group. We didn't get menus; since everyone but me had been there before. The staff just said ""Ok, we take care of you"" -- meaning, ""you don't get menus; we'll just bring some stuff out!"" They did check to see if we had any food allergies or preferences (such as eating vegetarian, liking or disliking seafood), and how hungry we are.

They then brought us plates until we declared that we were full. Each new plate was a new delicious adventure! Since we never saw a menu, I can't really tell you the names of what we ate, but it was all tasty. Off the top of my head I remember having fish soup with noodles, spring rolls with pork, mushrooms, some kind of spiky greens (delicious!), sesame chicken with sweet potatoes (my favorite), fried breaded squid, fish with greens, a spicier beef dish, tofu with broccoli (even that tasted all right), and something with shrimp. Clearly, going with a big group meant we got to try a larger assortment of food.

We did get to individually choose our drinks. I had the blossoming hot tea and the first glass was delicious (the second glass, poured over the already-blossomed tea, was a bit bitter).

Your large group will likely be squeezed into a table that's not quite big enough (just laugh about it and you'll be fine). You'll pass food around, and sometimes won't know exactly what you're getting, but try it and you'll probably like it. I'm a bit of a picky eater, but I tried everything we were served & liked all of it but the soup. The space is small, there's a sharp breeze blowing in from outside, and the staff is a fast-paced and bit abrupt -- but that seems to be part of the charm.

I hope I get to go along again next year; I can see why my husband's colleagues so look forward to going to House of Nanking!"
"My family went here for dinner during our stay in San Francisco. There was a line out the door but the wait wasn't horrible. I thought the food was actually rather good, even though the place seemed a little run down with tourists (probably because many guidebooks recommend this place). We ordered the sesame chicken, sauteed string beans and beef with broccoli, which i thought we're pretty tasty. The place is pretty small and they try to cram as many people in as possible. If you are going with a small party, chances are you will sit with another couple or family. We didn't mind this but its something to be aware of. The experience was a little rushed but overall i would say this place has good food at affordable prices. I would go here again."
"Wonderful!! This great restaurant was referred to me by a friend and while my husband and I were leaving the hotel to walk over I overheard a few people talking about The House of Nanking!! 

Needless to say we were excited to try out this well talked about restaurant. 

Truly a local gem! Traditional Chinese style eating best when you have larger groups. 

We started with the rice porridge with chicken, with dish was absolute heaven. The chicken had a bit of spice to it which added a flavor that burst in your mouth! I also loved the house specialty sesame chicken! 

Will definitely make another trip to this fabulous small mom & pop place!!"
"Very disappointed. After reading the reviews from Yelp, I had to try the food myself. Not authentic Chinese food at all, more on par with PF Changs. The food was average at best.
We had the Sesame chicken which was too salty, just ok. We also had the fried calamari which was very tender but tasted just average. We did enjoy the hot blossoming flower tea, it looked like it actually blossomed in the glass! Still, we won't return, there are too many other good Chinese restaurants in the city. Also the  cleanliness of the establishment is questionable."
Yes it's a tourist trap as well as a locals place but the food is very good. Dim lighting and nice decor are great and not expected at a cheap chinese restaurant. Expect to eat very close to tother diners. Food can be spicy if that's an issue for you
"If it's a Friday or Saturday night, you will be waiting out front. Inside is crowded and noisy. My rice was cold, calamari nearly so. Glad to pay and split. On other less crowded times I'm sure this place could be a delight. Cool old decor. Nice staff."
This is a great place for lunch or dinner.  We have been coming here- since they had the small kitchen in the front window!
"Passed this 10 times and didn't notice it until it was recommended by a friend back home.  Food was very good, the best we had in San Francisco.  Small place with long tables you may share with other guests.  VERY casual, a great place for lunch."
My taxidriver recommended it from this website [--] and the food was excellent the service was wonderful and the price was so cheap I wll go back when I come to san francisco.   JJ
"Wow, words cannot describe the quality of food at the House of Nanking. Let the owner pick your meal and enjoy every bite. This place is amazing."
Food is fantastic but don't plan to linger. The staff feeds you fantastic food quickly and encourages you to leave quickly.
"I was looking for a restaurant for dinner in san francisco, and i noticed this place with a lot of people waiting out. I thought that if so many people were waiting for eat there the food had to be special. My expectation has been copletely matched: the menu is very rich and all the plate are really good! I'm italian and here is difficult to find a Chinese restaurant so good.
The only bad thing is the service a bit 'rude, but it's because theyreally know whot they are doing!
Prices are accettable."
"After you've worked up an appetite exploring SF's financial district and Chinatown, pop into House of Nanking for a splendid brunch of delectable onion or shrimp cakes, sauteed pea shoots and a fragrant mug of blooming amaranth tea.  We couldn't decide what to order, so our server snatched the menus out of our hands and just kept the delicious dishes coming!  Delicious, inexpensive, funky/cramped, but pretty much the best of Chinatown."
"Some people love this place and there usually gets a lone waiting outside, but it's really a tourist place.  Once you sit, the service isn't that good and the food usually isn't either.  Bring cash because usually they will tell you the credit card machine is down.   I suspect they just don't want to pay the fees.  Once you sit they try to rush you through your meal.  They want you to order your drinks and meal quickly so they can serve it and then turn the table over to another guest as soon as possible.  It was almost impossible to get  a drink refill too."
"We went for dinner one night during our honeymoon, based on food blog recommendations. We had to queue for about twenty minutes but we expected this and it was not a problem at all. Once we got in we were shown to a table with almost zero elbow room and we were effectively sat on the same table as another couple; again not uncommon and not a huge problem. The service however was just plain rude, we were spoken to like we were an inconvenience. We were not asked if we wanted a drink and the food order was taken without even making eye contact.

When the food arrived it was plonked down on the table, again without eye contact and then the mains arrived a couple of minutes afterwards, still without taking a drink order. The food was ok, crispy won tons for starter which were rather pastry-heavy and the main of sesame chicken which was very salty and not outstanding in any manner at all. 

We were very disappointed and you can definitely do better elsewhere, even though it was reasonably cheap."
"Bit salty, but in general excellent
Good meal for the price"
"This place has zero ambience and the service is quick but not exactly effusive. However, the food is fantastic with great flavor and nice portion sizes. The potstickers in particular are worth the calories. I'm not even a huge pork fan but they melt in your mouth. Just yummy!!! Give it a try."
I guess this place is like marmite! You either love it or hate it but judging by the lines that they always have outside many agree with me. I like to go with a group and just let them cook stuff for us. Strongly recommend the sea bass though.
"Greasy, crowded, felt like MSG was a main ingredient. There are many many better Chinese places in Chinatown."
Won Ton Soup was excellent.  This place has some of the best Chinese food I have ever had.  I highly recommend it.
"I try to make it out to the House of Nanking each time I am in the city and find it one of the highlights. The food is absolutely delicious and there is some great variety on the menu. That is, you can try and order off the menu, but the owner seems to prefer picking for you instead and the dishes are brought out at high pace until you say stop.
Wonderful place. The best food."
Had a great seafood soup with pork dumplings that was the special for the day along with a spicier (because I like spice) chicken dish.  Both were very fresh tasted fantastic.  The next day we got take-out.  We had the house chow mein noodles and a hot and sour soup that were once again amazing.  Would go back when in town for sure?  It's very good for a great budget meal as well.
"Have eaten here every time I've come to SF, and the place never fails to please. It's a madhouse, but with such fresh, interesting choices, it's no surprise that it's packed all the time. I love that the chef comes to your table, asks if you have any food allergies, then says, ""forget the menu; I'll bring you something you'll like."" Five plates later, we've devoured every morsel and have enjoyed every bite. Go early (by 6) or be prepared to stand in line outside. But by all means, go!"
"waiter came and handed us menus--waitress/manager? came and took away menus and asked us what we like meat, sweet, veggies
nonstop flow of delicious food"
"Last time we went was 2005 and thought it was one of the best Chinese restaurants around. This time we were disappointed. Food was fresh but too bland. 
Next day we went to Yanksing and loved it."
"This is not a dining experience for the fainthearted, but if you're up for adventure and a true dining experience, this is the place to go. The place is small, you may be sharing your table with others, and it's cash only. 

I managed to slip in with a friend on a Saturday evening without a long wait. The owner/head chef came over and offered to order for us, which I understood was the way to go, so we did. 

The chef worked his way around my allergy to shellfish, and created a lovely soup (nice chicken broth with wontons, savoy cabbage and cellophane noodles), followed by a light refreshing beef dish mixed with tomatoes, mushrooms and perhaps some lemongrass. The flavors were unique and distinctive. 

We sat next to someone who goes there once a month when he's in SF. He swore by the sesame chicken with the sweet potatoes. Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to share. 

Despite the quirkiness of the place, I'd go back for another adventure."
"Not the usual chinese dishes you may be used to but they are all great. The line outside was impressive. All of Chinatown was empty and they had a line outside. Well worth the 15 minute wait. No Asians eating there but the owner makes up for it by screaming at his staff, so you get some old world Chinese culture."
"Most people asked the waiter to just bring them dishes, but there were only two of us - we ordered 3 dishes off the menu and they were all excellent. Best to avoid dinner rush-hour, or you'll be waiting quite a while for a table."
"I have never ordered a dish off the menu at the House of Nanking.  I always ask the waiter what he thinks is good, tell him how hungry I am, let him know what I don't like, and he does the rest!  This place is a real treat and after you eat there once, you can see why there is a line. You'll never have another Chinese meal back home (where ever part of the world you are from outside of San Francisco) like this one. Fresh tasty food that can be beat.  While the restaurant is not fancy, you're not coming here for the decor, you're coming for a real Chinese food treat that can be found anywhere else.  And, besides, when you step out the door, Chinatown and North Beach are at your feet...you can wonder around and see the City. Enjoy!"
"Flying to SF and had my 2007 DK guidebook in hand.  Picked this place from the book and went in search of it soon after landing.  Small place..communal dining.  We started looking at the menu then the waitress arrived and asked us what we liked.  We said beef and chicken, nothing too spicey.  Food is served family style.  The food was great...i wish we would have said fish as a choice we wanted ...not that the chix was bad, but would have love to taste what was offered in the fish category.  Had a fried beef salad that was great and a chix dish with sauce. A GREAT choice for a place to eat."
"House of Nanking has enjoyed legendary status for more than 20 years in San Francisco. Though I no longer live there, I have eaten there dozens of times, as recently as six months ago. In every previous meal the food was excellent. Two weeks ago a friend who had also eaten there many times told me he had a disappointing meal. Since I was in the city last evening, I went to House of Nanking. Something has changed - old standards didn't measure up. One of my dishes was below mediocre. Surprised and disappointed."
"Whenever I am in SF, I go to this place.  Let them order for you and you'll have a great meal.  It's not fancy and you might have to wait in line, so if that's not for you, go somewhere else."
I recommend the hot and sour soup with tofu. The house friend noodles with the barbecue pork was outstanding.
"As an infrequent traveler to SF, I've made eating at House of Nanking something of a quest. I've learned the trick is to not select from the menu but to simply tell the server the sort of dish you want. For example, this evening I ordered Hot & Sour Soup, Steamed Pork Dumplings and then asked for ""something good."" 

""You want meat or seafood?"" 

""How about chicken?"" The waiter wrote something on his pad and walked away. That ""something"" turned out to be a delectable chicken ""salad"" with lightly seasoned and battered chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes, basil, crispy rice and other seasonings that was simply indescribable. 

Everything was fresh, and the steamed dumplings (my measure of how well the kitchen knows its craft) we're absolute perfection!

I'm sure there are some misses, based on other reviews I've read, but House of Nanking remains on my list of ""musts"" every time I visit SF."
We went here for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised. It was quite expensive but the food was fantastic. The beef literally melted in my mouth!
Nothing fancy but food is delicious for a good price.  Good place to share a few dishes with friends.
"I am very, very picky when it comes to Chinese food. Years of cheap delivery have made me wary of this type of cuisine. 

House of Nanking changed all of that. It's family style, and I would strongly recommend ordering at least three entrees. The sesame chicken is fantastic, served with sweet potatoes. 

The mushrooms are also worth trying. I really don't think you can go wrong here. Be aware, however, that it gets crowded and noisy, so not a quiet evening spot. 

Delish."
"A place like this draws large crowds and mostly they're not asians but tourist thinking it must be heaven here. I would rather eat panda express take out with fortune cookie end of meal. My gf and spent $56 on non authenic Chinese food. 
Workers seems to rush you out the door just to turn over tables. 
*Please note if you're a tourist and Caucasian they will even bow to you while on your way out the door. I tell you what a way to kiss *ss."
"Travelling solo, they managed to accomodate me without a booking. Took some of the recommended dishes, wich were very tasty and reasonably priced. 

Service could have been a little friendlier, but overall an enjoyable experience. Definitely better quality and tastier food than most of the other China town restaurants"
"This is no longer the restaurant I used to love. Once upon a time I used to look forward to dining here on each and every trip to SF with great relish. It used to be a cozy little place with incredible food at great prices. The last 3 times I've been here I have been sorely disappointed by the quality of the food. Where did the magic go? The salt and pepper shrimp, the sesame chicken, it used to be fantastic, but no more. Now it's a cramped dirty expensive hole in the wall and this long time customer is throwing in the towel. Life is too short and there are too many good restaurants in SF to try instead."
"I've visited here several times, initially because of the awards, but then because of the quality of food... eat early evening unless you've booked - the locals love it."
"This place is famous.  And I eat there every time I go to SF.  Try the house dish Sesame Chicken.  We also tried the Scallops Tower (get it spicy!!!)  Fabulous.  

I think I already reviewed it here.  It's a no-brainer.  What may be the most famous semi-dumpy Chinese restaurant that marches to their own beat."
"Went here on the recommendation of a friend and it was fantastic!  Following her suggestions, I and my friends let the staff order for us and we were glad we did.  The food was awesome!  Shrimp tempura and crisp rice, sesame chicken, and much more that was soo good."
From reading other reviews and talking to my friend who recommended it I think I've figured out this restaurant.  Don't order from the menu.  Ask for what you generally want and let them bring you what they want to (sounds like they do this sometimes anyway).  My wife ordered (and got) the Sesame Chicken and it was fine.  I basically said give me something good and I must say they rose to the occassion.  I ended up with a tempura shrimp dish that had fresh tomatoes and fresh herbs (at least basil and cilatro) in it and it tasted fantastic.  This a restaurant for the adventurous.  I can see where not every visit would be perfect but they got it right for me.  Delicious
"House of Nanking is a San Francisco institution and I've eaten there many times - never been disappointed and this visit was no different! Went twice on my most recent trip. Had pork chowder (out of this world!) and dumplings on the first meal. Second visit was salt and pepper shrimp, pan fried garlic fish and pork chops - all just wonderful! It's a bit of a dive - a really bare-bones restaurant - but you can't beat the food!"
"Food was good, decent but had better. Service was bad, they rushed and didn't listen so messed up order."
"Took a friends opinion for a change of a Chinese venue since I always go to HUNAN and geez I should've known the second I walked in the door. I've never been so bad at not
Seeing the usual red flags:not one Asian in the joint except for the unhappy ones who could care less that we are customers, working the joint; unappetizing looking plates of food and lots of seated guests talking about how good the place is.....wow:a sugar and salt lick mix with no redeeming or Asian qualities. It reminded me of those awful strip mall Chinese places that serve buffet meals and people think that's what real Chinese food is about. A sad excuse for food at all let alone trying to be Chinese. Run the other way!"
"we didn't even order from the menu. Just tell them what kind of stuff you like (Chicken, shrimp, beef...) and they will bring you several mouth watering dishes to share with friends. Masses of yummy food only cost us $20 each - and that's including tip!"
"Food was excellent, service was fast - definitely glad we went there."
"We were a bit dubious about this place as we had read some bad reviews. How wrong they were! The food was absolutely delicious! You can't go past the sesame chicken and the beef wraps (can't remember the name) were yummy too. The wait staff were not rude, simply busy and trying to get you out of there quickly so more people can come in to eat! If you are after a long leisurely dinner, don't go here! If you are after something delicious to eat that will come quickly after a long day of sight seeing, so you can get home to bed....come here! You won't be disappointed....just don't expect silver service."
"Heard about this place  from friends and glad we listened! 

We had the Nanking sesame chicken served w/ thin sliced sweet potato in a yummy sauce and lightly steamed cabbage. I finished every delicious bite! We also had the sizzling rice soup served w/ chicken or just vegetables. Its not that spicy, perfect for me but something in it clears out the sinuses so have a kleenex or two with you!! I could only eat 1/2 of the large bowl but my partner finished mine and his! Very good and different! We should have ordered different meals to taste more which most people do.Everything we saw being served looked great!

Our bill with no drinks was $38 for two.

Seating is at communal tables which is a great way to meet new people! Service is attentive and we plan to get back before we leave San Francisco! It is one of our new favorites!"
"We were in and out of there in 22 minutes.  It was not b/c we were in a hurry.  It was b/c staff were aggressively moving things along.  We wanted 4 seasame chickens.  Some waiter than said it was too much chicken and literally said he would get us what was good.  We good one seasame chicken and three of the top most expensive dishes (fish, beef, shrimp something).  As soon as we had eaten, the bill was dropped on our table.  After we paid it, two of the waiters just stood looking at our table.  The awkwardness was unbearable so we left.  What jerks !!!"
"It's over a month since I visited and I am still raving about the pork chops!  I'd love to know how they make them so delicious and flavoursome.

This is a small place, be prepared to wait for a table in the evening.  The tables are quite squeezed in, embrace it and make friends with your neighbour!  The menu is quite short, food comes quickly and is delicious.  We had the scallops, pork chops, onion cake and rice and it was all super.

Great for a quick and cheap bite!"
A hole in the wall with unusual asian food.  The onion appetizer and the shrimp pocket appetizer were great. We shared a garlic fish with vegetable entree. It was great.
House made noodles are a must.  Really good food and a must when visiting San Francisco.  The only reason I didn't rate their service higher is that they were still mopping and cleaning when we arrived.  Service was slow while they prepped the place.   Food was excellent!
"My husband swears by this place so I had to go and try it out when I visited SFO. It is a casual dining place, nothing pretentious. But the food is extraordinary! We let the chef order for us - very good idea. We got the pancake, then a fish dish which literally melted in our mouths and curry chicken. We ended with fried banana dessert. All in all, a hugely satisfying meal."
"we went in due to previous nights seeing people waiting outside for tables.
the restaurant was overcrowded and we ordered starters and main.
my main turned up on its own before any starters and when i questioned this the waitress screamed at me saying thats what the kitchen sent out.
the menu is very limited and the food is average at best
try somewhere else!"
"I have no idea why everyone who visits this place and reviews it, doesn't give it a 5 star review. It's small. It's bohemian. It's cool. Ignore the menu. Just tell the waitress what you feel like - chicken, scallops, shrimp, whatever, and whether you like it spicy or not - and she'll bring you the perfect Chinese meal. On the verge of being too sweet or too salty or too perfect, this food is simply pure, fresh and delicious. Top it off with a Tsingtao or two and you've got a perfect meal. And I'm including every Chinatown and every Chinese restaurant from the West Coast to the East Coast. From Vancouver to SF to Chicago to NYC. I love this place. And I will make it a point to go here every time I visit San Francisco. It is that special. That unique. And that good."
"Nanking has been a fixture of the North Beach area for decades, and you can still order on the menu or ""off menu,"" if you want to, since there are specials every day, and the staff would be happy to recommend things not on the menu. Anything with yams is great! Portions are big and service is fast. Although the space is vastly expanded from the cozy place it used to be, the quality is still great - no msg!"
"I always eat here when I'm in SF.  It's highly recommended by locals.  Seating is limited and they're not open very late, so get there early.  The staff is not the friendliest, but they will recommend items from the menu.  The food is amazing.  I recommend the sesame chicken and house noodles."
"the owner ordered for us, absolutely fantastic food, and unique.  Will definately return."
"On a business trip to San Francisco - my colleagues and I took a bus tour of they city. Passing through Chinatown, the bus driver announced we were passing the best Chinese restaurant in the city - House of Nanking, right in heard of Chinatown.  It was a kind of scrappy looking little storefront on a very busy block.  I whispered to my colleague that the driver probably gets a commission for that announcement.  Later that week, our hotel concierge also told us it was the best Chinese food in the city - so we tried it out for dinner on a Sunday night.  It was PACKED. We had to stand outside on the sidewalk until a table freed up.  We couldn't decide what we wanted (and at first the server seemed a little annoyed and kept coming back what seemed like every 5 seconds to ask if we were ready). Finally he asked very sweetly if we had been there before - we said no and he said he could suggest some dishes. He asked us what we liked to eat, if we had food allergies, if we had any other preferences (one of our group was vegan, one didn't eat pork, one only ate chicken...). He suggested an amazing selection of dishes for us to share (making sure everyone had at least one thing they could/would eat).  He even stopped us from ordering when he thought it would be ""too much food"".  Some of the great dishes we had: Garlic eggplant, crispy fish, tofu and vegetables, pork dumplings, sesame chicken. We also had these giant mugs of ""blossom tea"" that had these suspicious flower buds (llooked like peach pits) in the bottom of the glass - and before long the buds opened up to flowers in the the hot tea.  And prices were very reasonable!  We got there around 6 and got almost right in - about 30 minutes later there was a big line outside. So getting there a little on early dinner side helped avoid a long wait."
"My husband and I were looking forward to eating some good chinese food in Chinatown and by the reccomendation of our taxi driver, we chose to eat here. Worst mistake ever! I didn't even eat my food. We both eat chinese food all of the time, but I decided to go with a safer option and chose the sesame chicked. The sauce on it was so disgusting I just couldn't eat it! (And I'm not picky at all!!) And the service!! You mean what service?? As we sat down we got our menus thrown at us and we waited forever to have our drinks ordered. We sat for another 20 mintues to have someone take our order. (A group that came in after us started getting their food before someone came by to take our order) I ordered a side of rice with my meal and found out that they didn't even put the order in! They told me that they could run back and do so, but it would take 20 min to get it to me. Forget about it!!! We left right then and I didn't even eat another bite. This was by far the worst restaurant experience we have ever had. Let's just say we will NEVER GO BACK!!"
"Boring soups, brusque and inattentive waitstaff (had to ask for water 3 times), and a rush-'em-through ambiance. Calamari was good, though."
"The restaurant was a recommendation from two different friends. Let the owner pick your food, but make sure to start your meal with an order of onion cakes.  Food was great!  Little wait at the door, but worth it. Order a bunch of food when you first come in as they will push you out after you finish your food before you have a chance to order more."
"I have lived in the city for many years and only went here one night because we were strolling around looking for a quick bite to eat with vegetarian options.  I would not recommend this overpriced restaurant - not to Chinese people who know Chinese food, not even to foreigners who don't know Chinese food. For service that isn't rude, no line, and higher quality food, try ANY of these places which are within a 5 minute walk:
-R&G Lounge (funny name but they are well known for quality Chinese staples and seafood)
-Z&Y Restaurant (chinese staples)
-Great Eastern (seafood)
-Loving Hut (100% vegetarian)
-Capital Restaurant (fried chicken wings)

If you're willing to go outside of Chinatown, head to Koi Palace or San Tung"
"If  you have to wait in line, then do it!  This was the best Chinese food I have ever had.  The service was interesting but they were not rude, they just run a tight ship.   They get you in and out and keep the line moving.  You won't have to wait long in line.  
Try the calamari, sesame chicken and whatever they tell you is good that day, trust them, they will serve you excellent food.  Nothing weird either.  Just sit back and enjoy!"
"The food here was great - although the very crowded floor and ""okay"" service downgraded the experience a bit.  Definitely worth a visit, but not if the group is in a hurry or tired from a day of touring."
"The House of Nanking came highly recommended.  Both the hotel concierge and tour guide, as well as a local friend said that it had the freshest Chinese food in the city.  As long as you are prepared for a long wait, and rude waiters.  We didn't find them rude, but hadn't previously had waiters who asked us if it was our first time at the restaurant, and then brought out the food we thought we would like.  They listened to food preferences, and then brought out numerous dishes that we all loved.  They certainly weren't dishes we would have ordinarily ordered.  
     We were lucky that we didn't have to wait - we had a group of 8 and our concierge was able to call and get us a reservation that night.  We found the servers pleasant and professional.  We were surprised that we weren't rushed out either, seeing how long the wait was.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"
"House of Nanking was recommended to us by a chef in our area as a great place, no frills, for Chinese food in San Fran.  The food we ordered, especially the potstickers and scallion pancakes, were fantastic!  We were seated at a table with another couple and had a nice time talking about our vacations together. Be sure you arrive by 6, especially on a weekend, or you will wait an hour plus for dinner."
"The only thing that made me happy was that we were seated right away. Other than that, forget about it. Nobody bothered to give us a menu, and when we asked for one, the waiter basically threw them on the table. After about 10 minutes, we finally ordered our drinks. My husband's water was warm. After 20 minutes I had to flag someone down to ask if we could order food. When the waiter finally came over, we told him what we wanted and he told us to ask someone else and walked away. We put the money for my soda on the table and walked out. House of Nanking was highly recommended and I have no clue why. We went to Yung's instead and it was fantastic!"
"During a recent visit to San Francisco, my family and I visited the highly recommended House Of Nanking looking for an authentic taste of Chinese culture and traditional Asian cookery. After reading several positive reviews in guide books and on the internet and seeing such long lines on previous nights to get a table, our expectations were very high before we had even entered the restaurant.
When we arrived at the restaurant our party of 5 was told we had to wait for 5 minutes for a table which we thought was perfectly acceptable considering this was the busiest time of the evening. We stood outside as our somewhat exaggerated wait time of 5 minutes grew longer and longer. We watched as groups of similar sizes that had arrived after us were seated before us. Finally after 35 minutes of waiting and complaining we were led into the crowded, unspacious House of Nanking. The waiter led us to a table that was already occupied and asked us to squeeze in at the edge! We were then presented with a cluttered unorganised list of ""Chinese"" dishes that they call the menu. As we looked around us the only people in the restaurant were American and European tourists eating what I can only assume they thought was Chinese food.
When our food eventually arrived, it was presented to us on multi-colored plates that looked like they came from a Mexican or Cuban restaurant along with a set of silverware. We had to specifically ask for chopsticks. 
The food quality was very poor and disappointing with far too much oil and fat. Compared with other restaurants in Chinatown the food was very expensive. 
It is obvious that House of Nanking is completely relying on a reputation which it must have acquired many years ago and is one of the least authentic chinese restaurants I have ever visited in my entire life.
There are many, many other chinese restaurants in Chinatown and I would reccomend to anyone to seek out something other than House of Nanking and not be taken in by the long lines of tourists waiting for tables."
Would not recommend this to anyone.  Food was just bad.  Services was lacking.  Extremely disappointed and will advise anyone going to San Francisco to avoid this place.
"Five stars for the food, zero for the service!!
Still, I'm glad we went here, had never had Chinese food like this. Try the scallops! They are a little spicy but taste really good."
"The food at this place is great!  The portions are very big.  In our case we shared the food and there was still plenty.   The service is done like in ""military fashion"".  They don't ask you if everything is OK.  I guess they already know that their food is good."
"A friend of mine told me that no trip to San Francisco was complete without dinner at House of Nan King.  I went here for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  If you have never been here before just tell that to the waiter when you are seated (and it will be crowded...but they are quick and worth the wait).  They will take away your menus and start bringing you lots of delicious food.  I think it was probably around $20/person...but you get a great variety of their specialties and the food is spectacular.

This place is small and easy to miss..but search it out if you want some great Chinese food."
"I cannot believe there are still unknown ways to do noodles and tofus and dumplings and not high end restaurants but inexpensive chinese eateries can invent them. the most delicious, innovative asian food in SF paired with speedy service."
"We have visited before and enjoyed the owner choosing the menu.  The food was fresh and delicious.  Then my daughter's purse was stolen from the back of her chair.  We probably shouldn't have put it there but everything was gone and started ruining our vacation.  I asked the owner about it and they shrugged their shoulders and insisted nothing was ever stolen there.  Whatever.  Maybe yes, maybe no.  But be careful.  Chinatown isn't very safe."
"The place is pretty small and tables are piled up. There is a line up on the sidewalk for lunch and the service is very basic ...

But the food is really well done. The best way to order in this place is to let the owner choose for you. He asks you basic questions (do you like fish, meat...) and then brings stuff to you... Always loved what they served me and I don't believe I ever even looked at the menu.

Not a place for a date or to sign a contract but a perfect place to have a quick tasty lunch in a very authentic setup"
"Had read many gushing reviews about this Chinese restaurant.  In the end we were a little disappointed.  The food was ok and priced reasonably.  However, to be honest, the service was a bit rude.  We both felt rushed out the door.  Not a disaster but wouldn't readily recommend it."
"Food is good but comes out randomly... Entrees before apetizers.... One person will receive there dish while others wait 20 minutes. We (and 3 other tables) sent food back for coming out at the wrong time. When one member at the table receives their appetizer the next guest shouldn't receive their desert.  Nor should the waiter mumble in Cantonese when the table asks him to take said desert away and bring the party members appetizer. Add to that food being thrown down in front of patrons. Service is beyond [---]. 

Food is outstanding.

However.... PF Changs is equally as good and actually has service."
"As an west indian, I do not expect much cleanliness in restaurants but this place needs work. When your server is using his bare hands to make a chicken wrap, you've got problems. The food is actually pretty good if a little overpriced. But just do yourself a favor and do not look into the kitchen if you plan to eat here."
"We were told by many people this was THE PLACE to eat in Chinatown. It was OK. It was very crowded, we were sat with two other couples at one table. I ordered Plum wine - they were out. I asked for tea then and they brought me a sprite because they were out of tea?!? We had calamari which was good. The other folks at the table recommended the wraps so we ordered those. They were ok. Flour tortillas with meat and veggies in it - similar to a fajita but not sizzling hot. The rice was also good."
"Recommended by our hotel staff.  Large portions, good food, quick service.  They did try to give us something that we didn't order and when we told them, they were pretty angry.  BRING CASH!!  They do not take credit cards!"
"I had dinner here with my friend in the last night of my stay in SF, after knowing that my flight for that night was delayed until the evening the day after. I truly needed something to quash my disappointment, and this restaurant just gave in the right answer.

The food was excellent, I particularly like the calamari and the chicken mayonnaise. Too bad I came when the restaurant was about to close, so that we dined in hurry and did not have enough time to enjoy the place.

But I definitely will go back to eat here should I come to SF again."
"The House of Nanking was almost at full capacity when we arrived, but we were lucky as the queue formed outside not long after we managed to squeeze into a table for two nestled nestled between other diners. The atmosphere was great, food served quickly and what tasty food it was. Our waitress, like a ""I know better older sister"" basically discarded the menu, asking us what we wanted and what you wish for in the House of Nanking you will get.  

If you only have limited time in San Francisco and want to experience China Town, make this one of your choices, the food is great, the service is fast, the atmosphere is intense and the closeness of the tables means you can get chatting to the people beside you. 

It is also good value for money."
not like charging an extra .75 for a bowl of rice.
Haven't been to this place in a while but I used to frequent it when I worked in the City.  It's really a local dive that's gained popularity with visitors by word of mouth.  Fantastic food here.  If you don't know what to order - just ask the owner to take care of you and he'll fix you up.
We loved this place.  Came here with our three daughters and we all thought it was delicious.  You have to try the blooming tea.  Amazing.
"We went here on the strength of local recommendation and many glowing comments on Trip Advisor.  What a disappointment!

Everything had to be asked for after ordering - including the rice!  Contrary to some reviews, the food was simply average ""chop suey"" standard fare, made more mediocre by covering everything with same sauce - which made evrything taste the same..

The waitress gave new meaning to the word""inattentive.""  It's a small place and our table was near aisle leading to the kitchen.  Even so, she forgot our order for soup and her idea of service was to bark out her demands for ""what you want"" very rapidly.  We'v e been to Mainland and Taiwan where fast is the way things are done.  This was not fast, it was plain rude. My wife is Japanese - we started to think the Chinese waitress had a thing about that?  That was enhanced by her failure to ever look right at us, while taking the order or anything else - the worst was when we dropped a chopstick and asked for a clean one - the waitress got it and waived it in our general direction while turned away and looking at others,  talking to them at the same time. 

One bright spot - the wine list included a $12.95 bottle of white ""plon"" that was not as bad as expected.

In summary:  a tourist trap to be avoided."
"Good food for a reasonable price. I went three times, each with a different person and we all liked it. Just know that if you want white-glove service this is not the place for you. The place is loud, crowded, you will probably end up sharing a table with strangers and your food comes whenever it is ready - pretty quickly but one dish at a time. 

To me, it just seemed like a part of the Chinatown experience. Everything is served family style so it's a great way to try several things off the menu and it was all good and reasonably priced."
"I am a vegetarian and I loved everything I had here till date. House of Nanking is one place where you should not give an order yourself instead request your server to decide. Just tell them what all veg's you like, how hungry are you and then see they will get you the right quantity and also the exact kind of food you were looking for. My favorite is Nanking Stuffed Mushrooms. And also a warning for vegetarians, Veg Chow Mein is not the same as Indo-Chinese Chow Mein and is on a hotter side. Ambiance is okay. So, if you plan to go there be ready for a long line and approx. waiting time of 15-20 mins. And for people who are looking for value for money then I must say that you may feel eating here a little expensive."
Went to Nanking on the advice of a friend.  It was a tasty experience. The owner sized us up and proceeded to order for us.  The food was very good.  The portions were average.  I would return here again.
"Even now when I think back on dinner at House of Nanking it feels more like something that happened in a dream rather than reality! we had read reviews so knew to expect a no frills restraurant and no frills service. My boyfriend and I were seated at the wall on a table with 2 other couples. We had menus and decided to order 1 starter and 3 mains to share, asking for the calamari main as a starter. Quite literally less than 10 seconds later a plate of calarmi landed before us with a gruff ""you said you want calamri  to start"" as the plate landed! Less than 5 minutes later all 3 mains had arrived and we were struggling to eat 4 dishes while it was hot... all on a tiny section of the table we had available! Everything happens at such speed you feel you eat faster too to catch up!

The food was amazing, could not fault a single dish although I am dreadful at eating fast and like to take time over each course... this is not an option here and so I felt i didn't get to fully appreciate the lovely food. The experience as a whole was wonderfully weird and I would love to try here again but I would arrive very hungry and be prepared to eat fast! Maybe second time around we would be more relaxed!

To sum up, we arrived at 8.10pm and 4 courses and 2 beers later we left, full and confused at just 8.45pm!!!"
"I see lots of people like this place. Great for them.  We booked last night.  Had sesame Chicken, Honey beef, chicken lettuce wrap, and everything else our waiter recommended.  My family dines in Asia a lot and is used to both subtle and strong spices, heat, crunch etc..  This place just didnt do it for us.  To be fair it was like so many other Asian restaurants we have dined at in the US.  Lots of sauce, hold the spice or anything that could offend.  In a word, it was ""bland"" to us.  However, if you are the sort of person who worries about too much spice with lots of sauce then it could be for you"
"Nice little local joint...small and busy....usually big queues but we managed to walk straight in. Food portions were big and really good. The onion cake is a must, it was so good I was wanting more the next day. If you are in SF try Nanking, worth a visit. Great food at great prices"
"I found the House of Nanking on the internet hoping to get the best Chinese food while visiting SF.   I was skeptical during my long wait outside the small restaurant.  The place was overcrowded and it was a tad akward sharing a table with another party of 2. The staff does not speak alot and don't really come back to your table unless serving your order. I had to raise my hand to get refills on our beverages and got unpleasant looks from the staff.  The had one single unisex bathroom that was not kept up probably due to the business of the restaurant.  But to make up for it all, the food was one of the best chinese meals I've had, and I've had a lot.  I ordered the sesame chicken, and my husband had the spinach salad with crispy fish.  Both were beyond excellent.  My brother had the calamari, which we all enjoyed, but had a kick of spice which was not mentioned in the menu.  His girlfriend ordered the wonton soup which she said was very good.    I would most likely go back to the restaurant if I visited SF again.  But first I might try its fellow chinese neighbor (I forgot the name).  I read that it has fewer lines and cheaper prices and may be just as good if not better.
If you are willing to put up with"
"If this is a stop on your Chinatown visit look carefully before ordering. Place is not very clean to confirm just visit the unisex 1 toliet bathroom that is only a step up from an airplane bathroom because it has constant running water with knobs that you can turn on. There was urine on black mat on floor and all over toliet as well.  Ladies If you need to use this be sure to roll up your pant legs! Menu was very limited, though they offer to cook other items. House fried rice was greasy and a bit hard. A cold shrimp salad had what appeared to be bitten off shrimp tails from someone else's plate. Hope they weren't recycling previous dinners food, but all 3 at our table felt uneasy. Tails don't just break off cold shrimp. The beef dish we got had a odd flavor and most of it was left on the plate--spoiled who can say. The one enjoyable item was to order the chinese hot tea which really had no flavor but provided a great visual. Had a hard time just getting water to drink and then had to order a glass of ice separate.  Service was fine but brisk. Would really look hard at crowd, cleanliness, and dishes on tables before committing and take note that you won't see any locals or business people dinning there."
"The best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. The waiter asked us if we were there before and when we said no, he advised us on what to order. The food arrived within 5 minutes and we were out 30 minutes later. it is a busy place. The food was delicious!"
"I'm pretty picky and I thought the sauces and food quality here was very good.  Maybe it used to be better, I wouldn't know, but we were cold and hungry and very happy with our meal.  Seemed like a lot of locals were happily eating there."
"This is the best Chinese food I've ever had--beating out comparable fare in NYC and Boston Chinatown districts.  If you're the kind of person who enjoys eating as the locals do, this is an excellent choice.  The dining room is as bare bones as you can get--they seat you at 6-top mixed tables, no place settings, stuffed like sardines, lines out the door.  Needless to say, the atmosphere is super lacking.  The food is incredible--though next time, I may opt for take-out if possible.  I had sesame chicken with a heaping plate of fried rice and a glass of plum wine all for under $25 YUM!"
"I agree with another recent reviewer. We were there in June 2008 and had the amazing experience of no ordering, just awesome Chinese food being randomly frisbeed across a communal table at us; crappy mixed-up melamine plates, a whirlwind mystery dinner then being ushered out, blinking, confused but satisfied and full, into the San Francisco evening.
Went back again this November and had a generic crappy Chinese meal.
What happened?!? So disappointed. Bring back the old House!"
"My first trip to the House of Nanking was about 10 years ago.  The place was small, crammped, brightly lit.  The waiter was rude, surly and simply asked what you wanted to eat and then brought you what he thought you should eat.  It was great!

Through word of mouth the quality of food spread and soon lines would form outside the restaurant every night.  People would wait to cram into one of the small tables and be told what they would eat.

Recently I went back....I kind of wish I hadn't.  

Still crammped, but now dimly lit with staff wearing brightly lettered House of Nanking shirts (available for purchase, of course).  There was an actual menu now, and thought the waitress was annoyed at taking our order, she offered nothing else and simply wrote down the order and left.  

The food itself (the house beef and the other forgetable dish) were ok, but nothing exciting.  I could get either back home....

Overall, it's still got some kitch and is well known thanks to the Food Network.  People still line up outside, but for me, I will always like the old place better."
"I lived in San Francisco for 20 years. After discovering House of Nanking when it was relatively new, I started taking visiting friends, family and business associates there whenever I had a chance. Without exception, people flipped out -- they didn't know Chinese food could be that good. 

Whether it's ""authentic"" or not, I'll leave to others to discuss. And besides, who cares? San Francisco is a place where food pushes the envelope. It tastes great, and it's unique. 

Well, I had not been there in a couple of years. Last time I was there, the prices were higher, but still fair. And much lower than going to some yuppie place with high-end furnishings. 

So when I recommended House of Nanking to my aunt and uncle last week, I couldn't wait for their report. Just like everyone else I've taken there, they said it was fantastic. 

Hint: Don't go there looking for friendly service. These are immigrants and there's a big language and culture gap.  If you go looking for great food, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I wish I could recommend particular dishes, but it's been a while...  ""Nanking-style"" dishes were generally very good.  BIG HINT: If you can identify Peter, the owner, ask him for a recommendation. You don't even need to look at the menu. ""Peter, we'd like something with beef, something with seafood, and some vegetables."" This has worked for me many, many times."
Chinatown wasn't our favorite part of the city. It looked run down and downright scary to walk through after sun down! BUT...we were recommended this place by our hotel and decided to live on the edge.................Well worth the risk! The Sesame seed chicken with fried sweet potatoe and white rice was great! As were the pork egg rolls. And it served two for about $30! Great value
"We were staying nearby in the Hilton and observed the lines of diner's forming in the early evening as we walked along Kearny Street outside The House of Nanking. One evening we decided to enter this crowded and hectic basic restaurant. It was an experience to remember !

We sat at the end of a table for 6/8 diners and soon started chatting to our neighbors and were given recommendations. They were a couple from Shanghai who regularly ate here. The food is plentiful and excellent.

It is hectic with plenty of action, not a quiet experience. We have eaten in many Asian restaurants in Asia. In general Chinese food is not our first choice but the House of Nanking is a completely different unforgettable experience.

Next time in San Francisco we'll certainly be back at the House of Nanking."
"We ate at this restaurant twice before and it was nothing to write about then but, at least, the food was tasty and inexpensive. Fast forward about five years, the prices are $10-$15 per plate of pretty lousy Chinese food, which is literally thrown in one's face with the bill quick to follow, since there is a line of people outside waiting to get in."
"I typically don't have too high expectations of Chinese restaurants in countries outside of Asia. Not that they are all not good, but I guess the dishes are cooked for the taste buds or preferences of that country - which, typically makes it less authentic than what you could get in Asia. 

Anyway, we went with low expectations - we were told that it's one of the best cheap Chinese places. 

The first time we walked past, the queue was so long we didn't bother. The next day, we needed to pack it for home, and was early (6pm), so I gave it a try. 

I was surprised to see that there was already a queue, and there wasn't really an area where you could order  ""take aways"". I had to squeeze into the restaurant, find a corner and try to get the waiter's attention. I wanted a menu, but the waiter looked irritated that I didn't already know what I wanted to order. He then told me to wait, while someone else will attend to me. Another lady came back (looked like the lady boss), and asked me what i wanted, and then shouted for another girl to entertain me. The young lady came, and was friendlier, got me a menu and asked me to call for her when I'm ready to order. 

While I was looking at the menu, the irritated waiter kept brushing by me, mumbling at how I'm in the way. I kept moving around in little spots where I could just stand, but I just have this ability to irritate the waiter regardless of where i stood. 

I quickly placed my order, and told the young lady that I will wait outside for my food. She seemed thankful that I wasn't going to stand around in the restaurant. So I waited for my food out in the cold....took about 15 minutes or so, and I did get a smile and thanks from the young lady. 

I must say that the food tasted pretty good (by Chinese food done the American way). Perhaps we were hungry, but we enjoyed our food. It's not that cheap, but still worth it. 

Don't expect great service, or fine dining. Go with the expectation that it'll be a bustling and almost rushed meal - very typical of how such Chinese restaurants are China or Hong Kong."
"Friends had recommended this restaurant, and although the meal was ok, it was not a place I would want to visit again.  Service was minimal."
"I always recommend House of Nanking to my friends visiting the bay area! I'm a repeat customer, and the food has been consistently flavorful throughout the years. The friendly staff takes delight in suggesting entrees for you, and they're always right on. I suggest you let them do the ordering for you, but advise them of dietary restrictions ahead of time. The food is served family-style, and the portions are generous. It's an experience, if you're open to no-frills, mom and pop atmosphere and just kicking back and enjoying the ride. I suggest it time and time again."
"Food was just ok, service was ok, prices high, packed us in like cattle. This place is highly overrated. Avoid at all costs. After we ate found lovely restaurants around the corner."
"The food is bad, the service is bad, the seating is bad and the staff could care less. A total disappointment. Ordered five entrees, all were simply sweet with touch of lime, each dish the same taste. Sweet potatoes with sweet sesame chicken, sugar and more sugar and no spices no taste. Panda Express serves better Chinese food. Overpriced. We are Asian born and can say with assurance that Asians would throw this food back in the face of the cook. Noted the lack of Asian clientele in the restaurant, and that the staff apparently eats from Tupperware containers perhaps of food they brought from home. Avoid this place unless you have no taste buds."
"Essentially a hole in the wall but clean, great service and great chinese food.  On the edge of Chinatown."
"This is the first bad review I have written and can't believe that San Francicans would accept this quality and level of service.
  We visited Nanking restaurant on the 10th of June after asking our taxi driver to take us to a good Chinese restaurant. 
  On arrival, the signs were good as customers were queueing up outside on the street.
  We were shown to our table , where the 4 plates were placed on the table, the menus placed on top and topped off with the cutlery.  The lady took the orders, making a good impression of Bumble in Oliver Twist.
   My wife and I had a starter which was a version of  Lucky Lettuce. The other couple we were with elected to have a main course only.
  Our starter arrived, followed about one minute later by both of our wives main courses but minus the fried rice. Around 15 minutes later and after repeatedly asking it's whereabouts , the rice arrived. By this time their mains were cold. We called her back stating this, so she picked up the rice immediately returning with the bill. When we asked where our meals were she said she assumed we did not want them. Unfortunately we still requested them. They were of the same standard as the service we had just received. Up until we left at no time were any apologies or renumeration offered. We should have refused to pay but were in a foreign country.
   It was obvious that other customers were having similar problems with the ammount of discontent going on around the room and this was not a isolated incident.
 Her attitude changed immediately , when on departing I stated I would be posting reviews on my return to the UK. Upon which her English improved dramatically and she swamped us with apologies."
"Although there are long waiting lines I have to advise you to walk by and go around the corner for better food, friendlier service and bigger menu card.

We went in early (around 5pm) to avoid the queue days earlier and unfortunately came to the surprice that this restaurant is not as good as hoped."
"My girlfriend and I were in San Francisco two years ago and walked past the House of Nanking following a sub-par Chinese meal down the street. At the time, we were intrigued by the long line of customers waiting to be seated and said to ourselves if we were back in town, we'd have to check it out. Flash forward to this weekend and we were back in San Francisco and in the mood for chinese again. We remembered the House of Nanking and, though the reviews were hit-and-miss, decided to take a shot. 

We got there around 7 and though there was a wait outside, it took less than 15 minutes for the two of us to be seated. It was readily apparent that they do their best to move customers as quickly as possible. We were seated at a table for 6 alongside 3 customers that were finishing their meals. Shortly after standing up to let them move from the table and placing our order, we were asked to move to a different part of the restaurant to make way for a larger party that they were trying to sit. I was relatively sure that our order would be messed up, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt, figuring they were used to the commotion.

Our food eventually came out in waves and wasn't particularly memorable. We tried the pork dumplings, won ton soup, special noodles (which came out 15 minutes later than everything else), and their moo shu beef wraps (I can't remember their exact name, but they were fatty and pretty bland). Overall, we thought the dumplings and soup were good, but as a whole, nothing was much better than average. The silver lining was that, in the move from table-to-table, they either comped or forgot about our Tsingtao's. 

All together, we were not impressed. I've had lots of asian food and the up-and-down reviews were right on the mark. If you're all about the food, you will not be impressed; if you care about the experience and influenced by what others recommend, you will probably think it's just fine. As for us, I'm glad to say I went so I could form my own opinion, but I won't be back."
"I came here a few years ago and the owner was there and treated us very nicely. We decided to come back last month because we remembered how much we loved the food. The food is still delicious but the service is so terrible that it makes me not want to go back, its that bad. The waitress seemed like she was too good to take our order and hardly came around. The hostess kept picking her nose in front of all the customers, at least do it in private where we can't see. My husband jokes around and says thats the special ingredient in the food hahaha. I'm not one to complain but seriously this is just too much. If it were up to me I would not go back but my husband likes the food and he is willing to tolerate the service just to have some of that chicken. I do not recommend this place I am sure there are plenty of good places to eat around Chinatown."
"I work next to Chinatown and enjoy the wide variety of restaurants in the area. I wish I had looked at more reviews before going to House of Nanking. The food was OK (special calimari was not very special). The table was dusty, the rice was not fully cleaned and the service was horrible. Hard to justify those prices. They must be living off of a once-good reputation. I will never go back"
"The food is fantastic! I wish I could find the equivalent in London.

Its very busy and you do a get a feel of get in, eat, get out but the food is so very worth"
"The first time I went to House of Nan King, I really loved it and suggested it to all my friends.  The service was good and the food was great! The second time I went 
was a huge disappointment!  I went with my parents, sister and her baby, and my Uncle.  The waitress had horrible customer service skills and acted like the Soup Nazi 
from Seinfeld.  After we made our order she was like 'That's it!  That's not enough! You need to order another dish!'  We actually ordered another dish after her tone of voice.
After waiting a long while, we noticed they didn't bring us our drinks, which was mostly water for our table.  We waited patiently and didn't press for it until it became 
evident that they were not going to bring us any water.  We kept asking, and the other waiter would quickly walk by our table and mumble that he was busy right now.  
A complete lack of respect and lack of customer service. We asked several times and no water.  Finally they gave us our water. And finally we were given our bowl of soup,
soup bowls and soup spoons.  They gave us one less soup bowl and one less soup spoon.  After asking for the additional soup bowl and soup spoon, they gave us the soup bowl, but no soup spoon.  Mind you, every time they gave us something, they would quickly run off to do something else.  They never gave our table any attention.  After asking several times for a soup spoon, after the fourth or fifth time, the waiter lost his cool with us, grabbed 10 silver spoons and THREW THEM ON OUR TABLE!  We about had it after that!
 
My sister while holding the baby got up and told the waitress who originally waited on our table and they were going back and forth arguing.  I then told the waitress, we want 
our check for what we ate, we are leaving.  We are not happy with the service.  She then got all apologetic and said no the food is coming, sorry we are busy, and not enough workers. 

She then yelled at the waiter in her language.  She ignored my request for the check and later brough out the main dishes.  I told her no, I told you we want our check for what
we paid for and we are leaving.  I had to say this 3 - 4 times before she would give us the check! 

I noticed a sign in the restaurant of a new branch of theirs that opened somewhere else.  I'm assuming that is where the owner was, since he was not at the restaurant when we 
were there.  That is too bad that the restaurant we were at was failing in all areas.  It's not worth it to keep the minimum amount of workers on hand to save money (my assumption).

The food that we had wasn't even good. 

Honestly, I have never been so disrespected in my life.  I will never go back and will tell people to avoid this restaurant."
"This restaurant was a recommendation by one of the Hop On Hop Off Tour group they have in the cit.  We didn't have to wait in line at all and were promptly seated.  We were not to sure what to have, and were not too sure of portions so the server said he would bring out 5 most popular dishes (pork, beef, fish,  chicken, vegetable)  I wouldn't say that any of us were saying ""Wow, this food is amazing"".  We found it ""okay"".  The one problem we did have was that the fish didn't taste fresh at all.  In fact, a couple of us described it as ""mouldy"".  We explained it to our server and he said he could bring us something else.  Instead, the manager approached us with the ""mouldy"" fish in hand and was quite abrupt saying ""There is nothing wrong with the fish. It is fresh today, I tried it myself"".  We felt that as a manager it wold have been far better for her to say ""I'm sorry to hear that you didn't like the fish, but we get it daily and perhaps this one particular fish was a bit off.  could I please bring you another dish or I can just take this off the bill?"".  But instead, she had to be rude.  We would not return to this restaurant at all.

We also found it kind of cramped and uncomfortable.  also, when we left we noticed the kitchen entrance.  To be honest, seeing vegetables stacked on the floor at the entrance door to the kitchen turned us right off.  Perhaps they should expand or reorganize themselves a bit better.  Save your money and go somewhere that has some class."
"We are currently in San Francisco (our first trip here) and decided to visit China Town today.  While walking around trying to decide which restaurant to try, we saw a long line-up for House of Nanking and decided to wait in line to try it.  Although I use Tripadvisor religiously prior to trying new places in new cities, I hadn't had time to look up restaurants in China town, but we were definitely happy with our decision to eat here.

The food was fantastic... we are going to sleep with happy bellies tonight :-)  Try the chicken dish with sweet potatoes (can't remember the name and the bill has it written in Mandarin/Cantonese (? which one).  It was very crouded, so not the perfect place to come with young children.  Despite the long line-up, the line moved quite fast- well worth the wait for good, original cuisine..."
"I came here on a saturday night, man this place gets packed! we waited in line for a bit outside, but once we got seated the food just made me forget everything! I loved this place! amazing food and great environment!"
"Just what you'd expect from San Fran's notorious chinatown! We got the tip from a friend of a friend, so I was a little nervous, but upon arrival there was a line out the door! A good sign on a tuesday night! We where a party of 6 and, when we told our waitress it was our first time, she told us to give her back the menus! I was a little nervous, but she basically ordered for us, one entree a piece to share Family style! It was great we all shared and split the bill and we got to try alot of good chinese! If you aren't brave enough to take the recomendation (or if you are eating alone) , you can't go wrong with their Nanking chicken...special! Wow!"
Really good and authentic food!
"The service was great, the food was awesome and the atmosphere was just right.  It seemed like just a little hole in the wall, but was much more than that.  Thought I had discovered some hidden treasure.  Then realized others knew about it too.  It's worth the trip, regardless of where you live."
"The staff is not necessarily friendly but the food is very good. If they aren't too busy (rare), ask the wait-person to order for you - just tell them if you want chicken, beef, pork, or seafood.  Otherwise, don't over-order. Entrees, appetizers, and soap can ALL be shared. NK is definitely the best Chinese food in SF."
"My wife and I had a great meal here.  This was my second time and her first.  I ordered the Sesame Chicken (outstanding) and we had the green onion pancakes for appetizers (also outstanding).  My wife had the stuffed mushrooms (I think that's what they were called).  They were great as well.  The place was packed, but there was no line.  The service was efficient, if a bit chilly."
"My wife and I were referred here by a local a few years back and almost did not go in because of a line of about 30 people outside. Because the line moved quickly, we stayed and are glad we did. The food is the best Chinese I've had outside of London. The seating inside is pretty plain. Little metal chairs and large tables. Even after sitting down on our first visit, we almost left because of the atmosphere. When the food arrived, it made sense as to why there was a line. The menus are a joke. Just tell the wait staff what kind of meat or fish you want and how spicy and they just show up with food. We never miss having dinner here when we visit now."
"I don't undertand these other reviews. It a packed dive that's inexpensive and very good. I had just returned recently from Beijing and southern china and it was comparable.

Try it.  The high reviews on trip advisor seem to be the fancier expensive chinese places.
Some are very good, but unusually for trip advisor, a few of the top are trendy, western and some ""touristy"" and fancy."
"I can sort of understand the appeal of this place -- it does have a trendier atmosphere and is cleaner than the typical Chinese restaurant. Usually packed with customers, one would think it was good... Wrong. The food was disgusting...every dish loaded with sauce, salt and spice, and devoid of any real flavor. Trust me, this is not real Chinese fare. The waitstaff are competent but surly, and the place is way overpriced for the poor quality of the food. I really wish we had gone next door to Jia's."
"A friend recommended this place to us so we just went there on our SF trip. We had fried chicken, beef with crispy rice, Chow Mein noodles and a Wan Tan soup. The food was mediocre at best - nothing extraordinary or interesting. The noodles were quite good, the beef was boring and without any flavor. What really sets this place apart is the service. If you are into unfriendly and non-caring personnel - come here and you won't be disappointed. I have no idea why there are so many positive reviews. Maybe this was once a decent eatery - at least the many review signs on the door suggest that. Maybe there are different cooks or service changes rapidly. However, I would recommend to avoid this place and spent your money somewhere else."
"This place is not the typical chinese restaurant. if you are into trying something new, this is definitely a great place to eat and enjoy the food! I've been to this place a lot of times already, their sesame chicken, crackling beef, chow mein etc are sooo good and it's different cooking than typical chinese restaurant. Each order is at least $8-$12 but four of us, ordered 3 entrees, side of rice, we ended up paying $11 each with tip already."
"oh, this is the best chinese food i've had int he city thus far.  the sesame chicken is on point son!  and the owner is a great guy who likes to come by, say hi, and then order for you.  i've never been disappointed.  prices are affordable and usually if he orders for you, he'll knock a few things off the check ;-)"
"Every dish was ghastly.  
To recreate at home: take innocent vegetables, pour 1/4 cup salt on them then drown in hoisen. Or Oyster sauce.  Any Asian supermarket sauce will do, as long as the flavor is overbearing a salty. 
I am bewildered as to why this restaurant is so popular. Left dehydrated.
Many genius Chinese restaurants abound in SF, this is not one of them. Worse interpretation than Panda Express, avoid at all costs."
"the food was excellent.  i'm a native chinese, so i've had my share of authentic chinese food.  i gotta tell you, this is probably one of the best chinese places i've been to.  if they had one in LA, i'd be there all the time.  i recommend the beef wrap, the nanking chicken, and the fried calamari.  
the staff were pretty much what you'd expect of an authentic chinese place.  fast-moving, efficient, but not very talkative or extra polite.  i personally don't mind it.  they're not rude, but just not polite.  
the price is a bit steep.  for 2, we spent $50, and we didn't have any alcohol.  
the wait was long.  we were there on a sunday, and we waited about 30-45 minutes.  that was at 9pm too.  but boy, i tell ya, the food was worth the wait."
"Seems like quite a few of the reviewers we had been told that this was the place to go to! And people in the queue behind us certainly seemed to have been there and enjoyed it before. We queued for nearly 1h and were eventually shown to a table (by someone who either did not like to speak to people, was mute or just could not care less). A couple of menus were thrown on the table. Still, we were quite excited. The service seems to run at 2 different speeds - those who know how (like the people behind us in the queue who had their drinks before our drink order was even taken and had their food and finished their meal before we had even received our first course). Not sure if this is something to do with us being tourists and the others being locals but it just felt bad! We eventually got someone to take our drinks order - and the drinks eventually came. However my tea had been sitting somewhere before it was brought to the table (it was a tea flower and it was fully open when it was given to me!). Food took a long time to come, and when it did it was greasy and disappointing. We ordered one starter and 2 main courses. They were all very small and having waited for ages, decided not to bother waiting for our second main course to arrive and left the restaurant. The rice was virtually cold when it was given to us. Small small portions and not great value at all. When we left to pay suddenly our second main course arrived! Needless to say we did not pay for it and out of nowhere the mute who had taken us to our table snapped the cash out of my husband's hand. We made sure we waited for our change - no tip was left. The following day my husband who does not cope well with MSG had his usual MSG (monosodium glutamate) reaction which does not happen he eats in good chinese restaurants. Very disappointed and we went home hungry..."
"My wife and I were very excited to eat here after reading some reviews.  The food was extremely disappointing, very oily and not good quality!

I also didn't like how the server made the Chinese burrito mu shoo with his bare hands.  How do I know if he washed his hands?

The place seemed very dirty and my wife even found a bug in her food!
Skip it!"
"The food was absolutely great! But you have to get there in the right state of mind! First you'll have to wait for ages in line before getting in, then get ready to squeeze with 8 other people on the same tiny table, to deal with the incredibly high level of noise and to get rushed back out as soon as you have finished your last mouthful!

But great food and reasonable prices!"
"This is the first restaurant review I've posted on Trip Advisor but having experienced the worst service ever received in a restaurant in nearly 40 years I felt I must post my first review.

We were recommended the House of Nanking on our recent trip to SF and on arriving to be faced by a queue of people we thought it must be good.  To be honest, when looking through the restaurant window the food looked great so we decided to stick it out and waited for about 30 minutes.  How I wish we had decided to go elsewhere!!

When we finally got seated we were met by a lady who I think might be the owner.  She gave us menus and took our drinks order (a couple of our party had soft drinks which were brought out in the cans with no glasses offered, but hey-ho we're not stuffy so just drank out of the can - we did feel it a bit strange though).

She then came to take our orders but first said that she would order our food for us containing a mix of chicken, beef and seafood.  We told her that we didn't want her to order our food for us and we would pick our own.  Surely that's what a menu is for!!

We ordered some some egg rolls (spring rolls if in the UK) and one of the party ordered soup (can't remember the flavour).  Anyway, the egg rolls came out and they were actually nice.  We polished them off.  However, there was no sign of the soup.  We assumed that they had not written it down when we ordered so decided to forget it and move on to the main course.  They were delivered to our table without any rice which we had ordered so we asked the waitress.  This finally arrived and was thrown on the table.  It was all sticking together in clumps and was totally overcooked.  Or maybe that's how they cook rice in China.  I don't know as I haven't been.  Anyway, suddenly the soup arrived and it was a huge bowl,  We told the waitress that we no longer wanted the soup as we were eating our main course so told her to take it away.  She turned around to the person who ordered the soup and said ""you ordered too much"".  We were in disbelief.  We would have eaten the soup if it had turned up with the appertizers but to bring it out with the main course and then blame the customer for over ordering when they deliver it to the table late is a joke.  Anyway, they took it away but we were getting dirty looks from the staff for the rest of our time in the restaurant.   

Now onto the main course.  Two of the party had ordered the beef dish (I think it was called crispy beef) and it was swimming in grease.  My husband, who will eat anything. couldn't eat it.  It was making him feel physically sick.   Two of us ordered the sesame chicken which was okay but everything just tasted the same.  The sweet potatoes that accompanied the dish was covered in the same sauce and it just got too sickly.  The final person in our party (the over orderer!!) had stuffed mushrooms which she actually enjoyed although we did joke with her that the waitress had probably spat on them!!!

When the bill arrived, the waitress had the gaul to tell us that she wasn't charging us for the soup.  I should hope not!!

Needless to say we didn't leave a tip.  

Would I recommend this restaurant to others.  What do you think?

By the way, my husband and I are not fussy eaters and have eaten at many restaurants around the world but posh and dives.  However, I am not prepared to hand over my hard earned cash to restaurants that treat their customers like the dirt on the bottom of their shoes.

If you're going to eat in a restaurant in Chinatown, please heed this warning and go somewhere else.

You have been warned."
"Out in SF on a trip ... this restaurant was recommended to us by our cabbie .... Food was a little better than expected... they do some things a little differently with good results .... but, the service was very poor, especially considering we hit it after the lunch rush  .... I cannot recommend based on the overall experience"
"Be prepared to spend $25-$30 per person for food you do not get to order.  After waiting in line outside for about 30 minutes we weren't given a menu, nor asked if we wanted to see a menu.  The owner asked if we were hungry.  That would be obvious since we were in a restaurant.  He said, ""I take care of you.""  Well he took care of our wallet, that's for sure.  He brought out rice which we thought was the equivalent of bread in an American restaurant.  Shortly after that someone else threw another bowl of food on the table.  We were wondering when he was going to take our order!  We had no idea what we were eating.  Food kept showing up.  We had no idea of how much we were spending!  We ended up with way too much food, most of which was wasted.  I really just wanted a chicken dish and some rice.  I didn't appreciate the owner deciding how much of my money to spend and choosing our food.  We were too stunned to ask questions, and the service was horrible.  They just throw the food on the table and run away.   It is almost impossible to catch a waiter to ask a question.   Not a satisfying meal.  Clearly this is their way of making money on tourists and getting people in and out fast."
Had fun at this place.  OK they want you in & out pretty quick but the food is good and price is OK too.  Enjoyed the fun of watching the staff running round & wondered how the operation works but it does.  The food was very good and the portions were large; good value for money.
"We couldn't tell you what we thought of the food because we were treated terribly from the minute we sat down to the minute we left and the quality of the food under the circumstances was irrelevant.  In fact we should have left this place before finishing our meal but quite honestly the service was that bad that we were stunned and in disbelief.  The first bad sign was when the waiter (older guy) looked at us with disapproval when we ordered one appetizer and one main course between 2 of us.  We also ordered wine and beer; we were having a light lunch.  The place was only half full and in this recession you would think that they put value on any and all business, but you'd be wrong.  The next blip was when we got our entree first without rice.  We were unsure if rice was part of the dish or not and asked the table beside us as they had been given rice and had the same dish.  They told us that they had not ordered rice separately.  We tried to ask the waiter (younger guy) if rice was included (for information), but he turned his back on us and walked away.  We thought he nodded ""yes"" but we were not sure.  He was extremely rude.  After another few minutes the rice arrived but we had almost finished the entree.  We politely complained about the late arrival of the rice and we got more bad treatment from the waiter who curtly pulled the rice off the table, mumbled that it would be cancelled off the bill and again turned his back to us.  Meanwhile there is no sign of the appetizer.  The appetizer did eventually make an appearance but at this point we had no interest.  So if the food is good in this excuse of a restaurant we wouldn't know because we were in shock at how poorly we were being treated.  This is the worst experience we've ever had and we've eaten in all kinds restaurants all over the world.  Our advice is simply ""don't go""."
"It is california chinese of course .. not authentic (I work for a Hong Kong based company and get to eat authentic chinese too).   But well, its tasty and filling.

Mu Shu pork, Huge (and I mean Huge) bowls of soup.   Tea with a litchi fruit in it (that has long green hairs flaking out of it as it soaks in the tea), so it is honey sweet and really tasty.

Very very crowded and you can hardly hear yourself talk.  And as others have said, make up your mind or the waiter will go all soup nazi on you and order for you.  In fact tell him you'll let him pick what dishes to bring in and take potluck, he's got great judgement I'd say... and will keep bringing random stuff in (sizzlers, main courses, noodles, rice ...) till you tell him to stop.

Works out best if you go with two or three people (or with about 10 people in a large group) so you get to eat a lot of what he has to offer."
"We enjoyed our food.  It is not your average Chinese food and that makes it worth going.  But don't expect to be treated well. They definitely want you in and out in a hurry!  And there was hardly any communication between us and the waiters.  They just kind of stand there and look at you...waiting for your order!  So, would I go back..probably not but it was fun to experience once!"
"I just had the pleasure of dining at House of Nanking for lunch, and was able to get a table without waiting, which apparently is a rarity.

We sat at a communal table, and were quickly served. We had the potstickers (nothing special), sesame chicken (quite nice!) and a beef dish with lettuce wraps (terrific). The restaurant itself is a dive, and the staff clearly attempts to get you in and out of there as fast as possible. The owner took our order, and immediately changed our beef entree to ""something better"". Well, we were happy with his suggestion.

Anyway, I walked by a night later at dinnertime and there was at least 30 people waiting outside. Would I wait? No. The food is above average Chinese, but certainly not the greatest ever."
"Service was just adequate. The food was something between authentic Chinese and Cal-fusion. Lots of fresh ingredients and big flavors. Fresh garlic and ginger, scallions and herbs were throughout. There were 4 of us and we ordered ""family style"". The chefs know what's good and fresh on any given night. They brought us sugar snap pea salad, salted prwans and spinach with eggplant, mushu pork, steamed dumplins and sesame chicken. All were wonderful. If your idea of good Chinese is ""a bottle of soy sauce on the table"" then this isn't the place for you. If you love fresh ingredients like I do then you'll like this place."
We had a great time in this place. The atmosphere is vibrant with families enjoying their food and waiters hustling to keep up with the demand. The restaurant is small but has good seating.  The food is excellent and the service is good.  The menu is short but there is plenty to choose from.  By the time we were ready to leave the line was a block long to get in. So get there early...
"After asking several locals their recommendations on a chinese restaurant, this was the only one that got mentioned.

Let the wiater order your food for you!  The 5 of us sat down and were asked if we'd been here before.  On answering no, the waiter (possibly the owner) insisted on ordering for us.  He then just bought out several courses of different specialities to ensure we got a rounded taste of what was on offer.  Everything was delicious.

We thought that when the bill came we would regret relinquishing control of our order, but it very reasonably priced especially when compared to the quality of the food."
"We were reluctant to try this place after reading mixed reviews. But, it was recommended by a friend, so we decided to give it a shot. So glad we did! All 6 of us loved the food, even with a few less-adventurous eaters in the mix. The place is small, and not air conditioned. The night we went, it was record high temps during the day, so it was not pleasant sweating while we ate. However, the food made up for it. Let the owner take your menus and give you the whole shebang if you are open to trying everything. They bring you 7 or 8 dishes to share with a mix of meats, and prep styles. The service was on the ball at first bringing dish after dish, then it slowed quite a bit while we waited for the check. The total bill was $180 for 6 people (including alcohol), but we were stuffed and satisfied that we all had an excellent meal full of variety! We were allowed to make reservations for 6, but I'm not sure if they take them for smaller parties. A line formed out the door after we sat down at 7:30."
"I highly anticipated my visit to the House of Nanking since it was highly recommended - yes, there was a waiting line outside to get it - but much to my disappointment - the food was not worth the wait.  The prices are reasonable - but the salted prawns with mushroom dish was bland. They do not keep soy sauce or sweet and sour sauce/duck sauce on the table which made it difficult to season  the food.  The fried rice was overwhelmed by the taste of onion and an unknown spice - not good at all.  The house sesame chicken was good - but that was it.  The place if very small and the seating is very cramped - once you sit down, don't even think of getting up unless you are finished with the meal or you are likely to disrupt several people's meals."
"House of Nanking is OK, Fun in a busy way. 5 star reviews, no way. Every dish we ordered used the same oily, red chili sauce base. Same experience with Market Street Gril, OK nothing stellar. These kind of 5 star reviews just don't add up. Have enjoyed using Trip Advisor reviews in the past, but will be very careful in the future."
Always have them order for you.
If you've not been- they take your menu away and start bringing food- and just the right amount for the size of your party! fun!
"A teenager in my party dubbed the food ""urban Chinese"".  It was good, but different from the usual fare.  For example, the mushu beef was sliced into thicker slices (domino sized), and came with thinly sliced squash that was crispy and little salty, along with the pancakes and sauce.  No grated veggies here.  My husband's sesame shrimp came with thinly sliced sweet potatoes in a sauce.  The soups came in over-sized bowls, and would have served 2 as a first course, but the wait-person did not tell us that. The hot-and-sour was good, seasoned with cayenne, and lots of egg and diced zucchini (that seemed an odd choice).  No tofu, bamboo shoots, or strips of mushroom-like fungus (can't remember the name).  The eggrolls were more traditional.  There was definitely sticker shock.  The bill for soup, eggroll, entree, and a can of soda for 6 came to almost $200 including tip.  This was more than twice what I would have paid in our local family-style restaurant.  If the food, ambiance, and service had been awesome, it would have been worth it, but the food was different but good, the ambiance poor (fortunately as a party of 6 we did not sit with strangers), and the service hurried."
"If you're going to eat at House of Nanking, I think I should tell you to reconsider it. First of all, the foods were really bad after remodeling. I always go to this place on my San Francisco trip, and what a disappointment. They subtracted ingredients such as peanuts and vegetables on nanking specialties. Calmary fried was too sour and salty, and looked really dud and simple. Secondly, I looked around and found dirty towels everywhere. I was shock to see the server was grabbing handful of kyoza(fried dumpling)  with the same hands he was touching the dirty towel! Lastly, bad customer service. Our total came out $45 dollars, and I was expected $5.00 change after gave the server $50.00 bill. Well our gratitude was already charged on the receipt which was $6.00....so we didn't have to spend more money on tips, which I wasn't gonna give them anyway. This fool thought that I was happhy enough to pay another $5.00 for addition to the gratidude. When I asked the server for my change, he yelled and cussed at me in Chinese with bad attidude."
"Top notch food, but don't go here if you're indecisive or picky.  If you take more than a few seconds to look at the menu, the waiter will order for you.  Think Soup Nazi.  Whatever he brought us was delicious!"
Heard about this place from a friend. As my mom and I were walking trying to find it we over heard the people behind us talking about trying to find it also. From this point on this will be a must stop for me.  This restraunt bordering litlle Itialy looks run down from the outside but dont let that fool you. The portions are good sized. Bring some family or firends and share a couple of dishes.
"My mother and I were visiting San Francisco and wanted to find a great Chinese place in Chinatown. We were shocked to find that we were put at a tiny table pushed up to our neighbors tables on both sides. The menu was extremely limited and even when we did order, two of the dishes that were given to us were the incorrect order, and they despite our protests our waitress told us that they were what we had ordered (when we looked at the menu we were certain we were ordering snow peas, NOT eggplant). Even more shocking to us was that we weren't provided with chopsticks and had to ask - twice - for chopsticks to be brought to our table. In the end our waitress was eating her own dinner and completely neglected us - leaving us at our table for a full 20 minutes after we were finished without clearing our plates or giving us our check. After asking three times for our check we finally stood up to leave, at which point they came rushing over to give us the check at last. An experience we would never want to repeat..."
Love the family style dining. Wave after wave of hot food came out of the kitchen.  Not sure what I ate but it was good!  Line formed down the sidewalk of people waiting to get in!
"Really enjoyed the whole experience of being at the house of nanking, the food was excellent and the service was friendly if a touch pushy. We went for the option of ""bring us enough food for 5 people"" and were not disappointed."
"This restaurant reminds everyone of the Seinfeld episode withthe soup restauranteer who insists you order a particular way. Our first visit the owner ordered for us. He was much nicer than the soup restauranteer asking us if we liked certain things and then came back with a wonderful meal. Of course our next trip to San Francisco we had to visit our now favorite Chinese hole in the wall in Chinatown. 

You absolutely must try the calamari. I will post a picture, but the picture can't tell you how tender this calamari is! Nanking has found the secret to making some really amazing fried calamari. 

We went to House of Nanking on October 16th and got street parking right in front just before they opened. We were hoping the owner would be there to order for us, but he got there about 5 minutes after the other server, a younger gentleman, took our order. Hubby and I shared the calamari along with sesame chicken. Love the sweet thinly sliced yams that are in some of their dishes. It was a great lunch and we'd definitely go back there every time we are in San Francisco.

Dishes are served family style so you can easily share. If you're with a good sized group it's great to choose a few dishes and everyone can try some of each.

The place is not fancy, but it's clean and comfortable, albeit crowded with lines and full tables closely put together for optimum seating. 

We found this little restaurant by asking the bellman at the Argonaut where the best place in Chinatown was - he said, hands down, ""The House of Nanking"". I've heard that sentiment echoed several times since and it's certainly our favorite."
"good food, pushy host, too much hype"
forget the menu. Let them order for you.
i so love this place and dream about getting back there
"So my wife and I decide to go to San Fransisco for her birthday. Once there we decided we wanted some sort of Chinese food. So we decided to go to the House of Nanking. Once there my family and I were sat next to complete strangers. Further more my waitress  and I had a hard time communicating becouse of the language barrier. So once we ordered and our food came out we were 1 plate short of our full order. We go on to eat thinking that maybe it's on it's way, but no luck. To boot we never got water and almost got charged for a plate we never received."
"I've been going since the early nineties, back when it was a poorly lit single room and the walls were dingy and greasy - so basically I like it.  Food's good.  However, this last time, we wanted to start with just several dishes and the waitress wouldn't do it.  She sent the owner/chef Peter Yang and he said he didn't like what we ordered and decided to order for us.  He said he'd make us up something special, so we agreed.  Well, there were a couple dishes some of us couldn't eat, despite our asserting to the contrary.  And I really wanted an onion cake but decided to not to complain when it didn't arrive - and then someone else said, I'd really wanted that onion cake too, so I was disappointed.  The people sitting next to us said he'd done the same thing to them - ignoring their order for his own.  And, I began to notice a particular dish on most every table - so that must have been what they had special that night, and boy were they pushing it.  And the meal was suddenly over $100 for four - more than we would have spent.  Felt like we were railroaded.  Not pleasant."
"Great place, fun, creative options, intense service"
"Tourists love being yelled at by the chinese food ""nazi"""
If you go to House of Nanking you don't have to order...they do it for you. It really is value for money. Don't expect anything fancy. House of Nanking is basic but very good chinese food. We went there several times with our children. They loved it!!!!
"We queued for 40 minutes in the street for a table for 5 but it was worth it. The first thing the owner did on seeing we were english was to proudly show us the picture of Jamie Oliver queuing in the street when he went.!! He then asked us if we trusted him and were hungry and said he would give us a good meal.!!!

He certainly did not disappoint us as a  series of dishes kept arriving all delicious, especially the house speciality of nanking chicken and potatoes wich we ordered an extra plate of. The whole time that queue just kept going all evening- not bad for a wednesday.  

The best suprise of all was a very reasonable bill- it was fantastic value - join that queue it was a great experience"
"People love it or hate it. Nanking shrimp, calamari, onion pancake, Tsingtao...never disappointed."
"we took the advise for House of Nanking from Lonely Planet ""San Francisco"" in Aug. 08 and found it terrible. I have to say that due to family background and dozens trips to Taipei, Bejing, Hongkong, Shanghai and Guangzhou I appreciate all kinds of chinese cuisine (beside Shanghai style) very much but also recognize lousy chinese food immidiately. For HoN I ignored all warnings signals, the place, plates and forks are dirty, no chinese locals in the restaurants, only tourists. We had Jiaozi (chinese dumplings), fried squied, pork and beef. Too summatize: All dishes were nearly cold, oily close to been slimy and overloaded fully of glutemate. The service was non existing, they bang the dirty plates on the table and do not further care til the bill to been checked. Don't get me wrong, we were tretated like everybody else, no reason to complain, it was just lousy.
My recommandation: Be selfconfident, ignore the queue and the tendancy to join just to ""be a part of the hype"" + Lonely Plant and other travel guide recommdations, look for Place with Locals Chinese waiting to be seatet like china lounge some houses ahead in direction finance district."
"I've eaten at alot of Chinese restaurants, in North America, Europe and even in China.  The House of Nanking isn't quite like any of them.  It is extremely popular which we knew before heading out but hadn't expected a wait of over an hour shivering the street before getting in.  We should have known to dress more warmly on a summer night in SF!  Anyway, we persisted, mostly because of the smells coming from inside and were treated to a unique experience when we finally got in.  We were squeezed into a table just big enough for the three of us (my wife, young daughter and myself) and then three more people we hadn't met sat down and joined us.  The noise level was extremely high and the waiter probably impossible to understand even in dead calm but, strangely, it all felt very welcoming.  I fired off an order within seconds of being seated and it was all delivered at lightning speed.  The food was excellent and, as it turned out, so was the unexpected company at our table!  I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone looking for a relaxing meal but if you want a truly unique SF Chinatown experience, have a go!"
Loud and crazy. But as long as you don't try to order you can have an amazing and unusual chinese meal.
Simply tasty - try the rolling lettuce beef with pancakes instead of lettuce (not on the menu).
the pork chops are tasty! yummy ... the scallop towers are delicious too!
"This restaurant was recommended to us by a stranger we met on the Napa Valley tour.  When we arrived at the location, some of us were skeptical.  There was a long line to get in.  Its a small restaurant that looks like a lunch place.  No frills when it comes to decor or ambiance:  folding table, plastic cups, etc.  But decor is not why you go to House of Nanking.  You go for the incredibly delicious and unique Chinese food.  When we started asking the server questions about the menu, he took our menus away from us and assured us he would send out great food...afterall, he was the Chef!  (and the owner, it turns out).

We were not disappointed!  Everything was fantastic.  Some sweet, some spicy, some seafood, some vegetarian, all unique.  He told us these were all old family recipes.  I would go there again anytime I went to San francisco."
worth waiting in line for.
"My husband, in-laws and I were in San Francisco for vacation in early June, and we ate here per a recommendation in my Lets Go San Francisco book. There are tons of places to eat in China Town, and I'm sure most are great, but we really enjoyed our meal at House of Nanking. Like most other reviewers, our meal was ordered for us by the owner, and everything was terrific tasting. The fried calamari and sesame chicken were my favorites. We also had pea shoot salad, a veggie dish, pork egg rolls, and some sort of fried shrimp tringle-thingy. We had about 6 or 7 dishes between the four of us, which is a lot of food, but most of the platters were empty when picked up! The bill was around $50, which is cheap in my opinion. As far as it being authentic, I don't really care about that, so that wasn't something I was looking for.

This was the only place we ate in China Town, but I highly enjoyed it, and will definitely hit it up again."
An institution.  It's good but not great.
"The House of Nanking came recommended by a co-worker that had lived in San Francisco. So as it happened, my group of four came upon the resturaunt just as they opened at 11 am. We were ushed to a table and politetly handed menus. After looking through the menu, a nice gentelman, who we learned was Mr. Peter Fang, the Chef and Owner,came and asked if this was our first time. We said yes, and he took the menus, and with a huge smile said ""I'll take care of you"". From then on, it was great. We had to ask the server a couple times what things were, but it was superior. We had a great time, the staff was very attentive, the prices were reasonable, and the food was great."
"My first trip here, I really liked it.  I was new to SF and enjoyed the whole ""soup nazi"" atmosphere.  The second time I went, I realized that the food all had the exact same flavor no matter what I ordered.  The third time I went, I was over it completely.  Its alright, I guess, but if you're in the neighborhood, go next door.  The food is better, cheaper, and there is NEVER a line up the street."
a destination in and of itself - great hunan chinese food and an sf hangout
Excellent food in a chaotic ambiance. Expect the kitchen and the storage room in the middle of the restaurant.
"Most negative reviews on this site seem to be because people have incorrect expectations when they visit a restaurant or hotel. If I was looking for a relaxing, fine chinese dining experience with professional service, Nanking isn't for you. Nanking is like a San Fran Chinatown equivalent of Pat's Cheese Steaks in Philly. Bustling, crowded, toursity, but good. My friends recommended this place for great chinese food. My wife and I went early on a Wednesday evening and did not have to wait. My friend mentioned to order ""family style,"" although I was concered as there were onyl two of us. I asked the server (who I think is the owner) if he recommened family style, he appropriately asked ""how hungry are you?"" At this point I did not know what to expect, although I was happy he didn't force us into making a decision. I guess we could have ordered off the menu, although ordering ""family style"" is the rule here and be prepared to be surprised. If you are coming to pick something out on the menu, or you have your heart set on ""I want to try Nanking's version of..."" you may be disappointed.  Eating here is more of a game and an adventure and it seems as long as you play by their rules, you will have a great time. We told the server we were sorta hungry. With that being said, 3 courses of food came out and it was all excellent. I'm not sure how authentic it was as the first dish tasted more like bruschetta at an italian restaurant, although everything was good and the sauces were unque and the food tasted fresh. Actually, I could have had another course, although I am a pig and my wife was fine. It's loud, a little cramped, be prepared for your personal space to be invaded, not the prettiest place, although that is what gives it character and gives you a unique experience that you'll always remember. I definately recommend going with a group of 4 or more and telling them to lay it on heavy."
"this is easily the best chinese food i've had. you just tell them your hungry. they ask how hungry. and you respond with your level of hunger. then they bring you perfect food. . .and it is always enough. you can order specific things, but i recommend leaving it to them. you can just tell them if there is something you specifically don't want."
"People love it or hate it; i think it's pretty good. There's a long line, but owner does pick people to sit first (!). Just leave the choices to him; tell him what you don't like and he'll get you his daily specials."
"After reading the majority of the reviews, my wife and I, our one year old daughter and my sister decided to go check it out. I must say that it was absolutely wonderful. You cannot go wrong with the adivice of letting the server order for you. There is that element of suprise which in most cases you would probably not want to do but in this case it was well worth the chance. I cannot tell you the names of the dishes however their version of clam chowder was great. We had spicy shrimp in spinach leaves with some sauce that was good eneough to lick the plate clean. Deep fried aspargus with fresh tomatoes mmmmm.... But what was most satisfying as parents is that our daughter again who is one loved the food. However this is not an infant/toddler friendly place. No high chairs, tight fit as it is a small, loud and crowded restaurant. We luckly have a compact booster seat which worked great. Our daughter is pretty outgoing so she was fine and the great food kept her entertained. A San Francisco must!"
"If all you care about is the food and not atmosphere, this is a good place for chinese food. The service was abrupt, rushed, and it was definitely testing to sit in a place so loud and crowded next to strangers. However, having said that, the food is good chinese food and is not ridiculously priced. I just personally prefer a better atmosphere and service."
Good place with a large group and reservation.  Not so good if you have to eat just one dish.
"Not as good as it was before it expanded in the late 90s, but still the best Chinese in SF."
if you're patient enough to stand in line for at least 30min... but food is good not a very nice atmosphere but good to try once
Probably some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten!
"A notable hole-in-the-wall on the fringe of Chinatown, locals and tourists alike queue outside for a seat. Be advised, this is a tight squeeze, and the owner can and will adjust your selection to better fit what is being made in the kitchen, or to merely suit his whims. One might confuse this with rudeness, or one can take it in stride and know that you are eating better than average chinese, hot out of the kitchen, for quite a reasonable price.

In short, better than average cuisine with good portion size, and lesser than average decor and comfort...sort of like eating inside a NYC subway station."
"Amazing food! There's always a line though. Child friendly, but they have no high chairs, so carry your portable baby seat."
"Great atmosphere, great authentic food!"
Tasty but definitely more fushion. Don't even bother to look at the menu. He'll cook you whatever anyway.
Must visit when in San Francisco.  Place is always packed.  Unique stir fry combinations with thinly sliced yams.
It is all about the food here.  No ambiance AT ALL.  The owner is great!
"I am not a fan of this place, but a lot people like it."
"guaranteed good food, not great service, packed all the time, priced $7-20, trendy not traditional"
"Great food such as thinly sliced beef stirfryed with fresh veggies and crackling-rice and non-greasy pork dumplings. The sweetly-sauced sesame chicken had a thin, crispy batter with a side of sliver-thin yams. Although, this is NOT a very ""pretty"" resturant. Decor is sparse with white-tiled walls and aluminum chairs."
Classic tourist Chinese restaurant. First timer to SF will likely visit this joint.
food was good but stopped going after seeing a cockroach crawl across the wall
this place is so fun.
This place is intense...food is good...lines are long.
This place is a bit strange.  We waited in line to get a seat as it's so busy.  The staff are rude and abrupt and sometimes ignore you but the food was sensational!  The food is worth the wait and the strange wait staff. YUM.
Not bad.
"Used to be a lot better, now a bit too touristy for my liking"
love it!
This is just not classic chinese food
"omg, soooo good."
It's Nanking... Duh
"yummy, grimy and cheap!  the best chinese food in sf :)  as long as you don't care about ambiance and are not afraid of a little grime, then check this place out"
"Some of the Best Chinese food you'll find in the city.  Servers can be a bit pushy in terms of what they think you want to eat, but they're ususally right"
"yes it's a hole in the wall, a tiny, busy, cramped place with a line out the door - and some of the best Chinese you will ever have. don't order, just let chef Peter and his staff start bringing you dish after delicious dish of Chinese, using ingredients you don't find at your usual local place. surprisingly cheap too. I wish I could transplant House of Nanking to Phoenix!"
"Don't try to order off the menu, just pretend you've never been there before and do as the nice man says."
The food is awesome..but u gotta b patient with parking
decent chinese food here... but crowded!
"The service is bad, and it's not the cleanest of places, but the food is amazing. I haven't had a dish there that I didn't like yet, and I've eaten half the things on the menu. This restaurant is also Zagat rated. Eat an early dinner there because the line gets really long at night."
"Nine years ago, as my wife and I were celebrating our first anniversary in San Francisco, I had planned a trip to Nanking based on recommendations from friends. Problem was - when we got there, she was appalled by grease on the walls and windows and refused to go in. A short argument ensued and we walked to Jackson St. to sit down in what appeared to be a neater restaurant ...and found a perfectly wok-fried cockroach in the cashew chicken.

Several years later, while in town for a Dodgers/Giants series with friends, we visited Nanking and were impressed, which I dutifully reported to my wife.

Fast forward to last weekend, and Nanking has scrubbed the walls and put in new windows. The wife was ready to try it and wasn't disappointed.

A genuine experience of San Francisco. Non-existent creature comforts, above average food, steaming mugs of green tea sweetened by flowers, and an owner with a commanding presence. He'll order for you, bring you your food, touch bases to see if you're enjoying it, and work the ropes to make sure the people waiting outside stick it out.

While no-frills, it isn't cheap. Lunch for three--no alcohol--ran $45. Still, highly recommended."
"Great Chinese food, outstanding! And cheap... Good service."
Salty Chinese for Tourist and People who don't know any better
good american style chinese food
they have some good stuff
Price is Moderate.  Food is decent.
"The House of Nanking is a great dive and a must stop when in San Francisco.  The owner, Peter Fong and his wife, take your order personally and usually suggest items based on your selection of seafood, poultry or beef.  They are a no-nonsense, mom and pop stop.  If you're looking for polite, foofy, white linens type of service - this is not your restaurant.  Top picks: House of Nanking chicken, garlic string bean beef, calamari in Chinese vinegar, onion cake with peanut sauce."
"What a find indeed.
I am spoilt because I live in Melbourne Australia and spend a lot of time travelling through Asia.
Was wrapped to find a jewel like Nanking in the US.
If you have 4 or more people let the owner order for you and you will not be dissapointed.
If you want to order yourself, you really can't go passed the following dishes:
Tofu Salad
Beef and Beans
Mushrooms with Basil
Calamari
Seasame Chicken
Shrimp Salad.
Be prepared to wait at times or go early!"
"Four of us ate here on the recommendation of a friend in St. Louis, as well as our hotel. We went in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday, and still had to wait a bit. The serving sizes were large enough to share, and the Sesame Chicken was excellent. We did think the prices were a little high for Chinese food, however."
"A friend recommended this place and I went with my wife and brother-in-law. Doesn't look much from the outside, multi coloured sign design-less sign etc but there was a line outside which is always a good indicator. Much like a busy nightclub it was a one table out, one table in affair. Was only about a ten minute wait but it looked worse.

The tables are bare minimum, the chairs metallic looking plastic but ignore all of this. Let the waitress know what you like (seafood, beef etc) and they'll whip up a wonderful variety of items.

It knocks spots off any of the very good Chinese restaurants I've been to in the US, the food is just cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce. Our only 'bum' dish was our chicken which was just OK. All done in around 45mins!

For the three of us it was only $55 plus tip, and we had a beer each! Can't be beaten on value either."
"concierge recommended.  All the food was thrown on the table, food was notably greasy, service was unfriendly.  Guess we hit a bad day.  Wouldn't try again."
"My husband and I decided to try this restaurant after reading the posts here and on the advice of the concierge of our hotel. We went early to avoid the line and we were seated at an individual table.
My husband was looking for a spicy chicken dish. He asked the server, who was not very friendly, what she would recommend. She ended up bringing to us the Sesame Chicken, which was ok, but definitely not spicy. We told the server that it wasn't spicy, she took it to the chef and he sprinkled pepper flakes on top. Not our idea of spicy! The fried rice was terrible. The egg rolls were so so. 
We were so upset that we ate here for our one night get away to the city(kid free!). I talked to a local resident (she was Chinese) and she told us she doesn't eat in China Town as all the restaurants are for tourists."
"Word of advice: let the waiter order for you and your food will be twice as good.  Apparently, this is common knowledge there, but I didn't know the first time I went.  Excellent Moo Shu vegetable. One of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco, and by the wait, I know I'm not alone."
"I was so glad to see that House of Nanking was still there and still had a line to get in.  I used to eat here often in the early '90 and when I was on vacation I had to decide which restaurants to eat at that I missed.  The kids really wanted to explore Chinatown so I said great we will walk on down to House of Nanking from there.  I have never eaten a bad dish there.  Yes you sometimes get put at a table with strangers and the atmosphere is non-existant but don't let that put you off.  It almost always has a line and we met a nice young man that had just moved to S.F. the week before and his friend visiting from England and another group from France and the line moves very quickly while we were all conversing.  My 5 year old a somewhat picky eater inhaled her food, I honestly never saw her eat so much I thought she was going to hurt herself!"
"The food was really great, but overpriced.  We ended up letting the owner order for us, just as the other reviewers said to do.  Our total bill was $40 for 2 people for lunch at a Chinese restaurant just on food. Would go back again though. The watercress salad, calamari and prawn cakes are excellent."
"If you're looking for a fancy atmosphere forget it. This place is cramped and they don't exactly overspend on high quality tables and chairs.

If you're looking for outstanding Chinese food do not pass go.

First of all this is a cash only experience. They don't take plastic in any form.

Try the fried dumplings (pot stickers for those of you in Indiana). OY!!! They are very good. Many of the dishes trend towards being a bit sweet but are delicioso.

The rice is well...rice.

If you come in the evening there can be a line outside this smallish restaurant but it's not highly populated by tourists. Many locals eat here which is good sign.

The location is not in the very heart of Chinatown which is also a good thing.

Assuming the weather is good it's a nice stroll (15-20 minutes) from the financial center.

Highly recommended."
"I was in town for business in April 2007 and was looking for a unique dining experience.  While watching television at the hotel, I saw Rachel Ray's review of San Francisco eateries.  She gave a very good review to the House of Nanking.  And after eating there, I must second her opinions.  The restaurant has very good, unique food in a casual, neighborhood type setting.  The line to get in seemed long but moved very quickly.  The restaurant is small and the tables are positioned very close together.  We ended up sitting next to a couple from San Diego.  But we didn't mind it, we struck up an interesting conversation with them.  The food was excellent and came with large portions.  Also, the prices were very reasonable and reminded me of what I normally pay to eat Chinese food in my hometown, Houston.  I give the House of Nanking high marks and would eat there again when I am in San Francisco. (The concierge at my hotel gave the restaurant a poor review.  But after eating there, I have no idea why--perhaps he receives an honorarium from other Chinatown restaurants.)"
"We made the mistake of eating in the first chinese restaurant we came across in Chinatown - what a mistake, granted we were very tired an jet lagged. 3 days later we actually dumped a reservation at the uber-cool Supper Club to hunt down Nanking. We were not disappointed. Hectic, noisy, busy, dog eared one page menu, plates thrown down in front of you, soda served in a can (with a straw) it was EXCELLENT!!!!  The food is amazing, the servings are big and the price is sooooo reasonable. As the title says...DO NOT EAT CHINESE FOOD ANYWHERE ELSE!!"
"It doesn't look like much, but the food is well worth waiting in the line outside.  If you're looking for good Chinese food, this is the place to go.  If you're looking for ambiance and service, this isn't the place for you.  The tables are close to each other (we had conversations with our neighbors) and the service is efficient (food comes out when it's ready).  It's not luxury, but it is a great price for the value.  The hot tea is au naturel with lots of floaty herbs and spices - try it if you're a tea fan.  All the food was impeccable."
"While in Chinatown, it's overwhelming the dining choices.  In fact I made a call to a friend to look up a place to eat with good reviews on the internet... They called back and we ended up at the House of Nanking.  Ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Sesame Chicken... WONDERFUL!  But, don't miss out on the potstickers, they were so good.  Very good food at a very small price..."
"My in-laws visited Nanking before we arrived in San Francisco and had such a great meal that they took us on our last night. What an experience! The owner asked if we had been in before, and my in-laws told him that they had been in on Friday. He promptly picked up our menus and said that he would order for us. It turned out great. Every dish was a new experience. He must have a lot of trust in his food and cooks. Everything was so fresh. I had the best calamari that I've ever eaten. The sesame chicken with fried sweet potatoes was excellent. The surprising part was the amount of food that we received for the price. We had asparagus, soup, egg rolls, potstickers, calamari, sesame chicken, and moo shu shrimp and chicken. I was a little nervous because the dishes kept coming, but the cost was around $20 a person with dessert and tea. This was our best meal of the trip and the best Chinese food I've ever had."
We have eaten here each time we have been to San Fran and had a fantastic meal. I agree with the other review to let the owner choose for you as its more fun and you get to try some different things. Yes you may have to wait a little while and its more canteen style than candle lit dinner style but the benefits are that you get to experience a whole different culture than what you would in any other run of the mill Chinese restaurant plus the food is something else!  We are going back in March and looking forward to paying them a visit again!
"Having grown up in NYC I've had my share of wonderful asian food since the mid 1970's.  Last time I was in San Francisco with my son we were there for 4 days...we ate at House of Nanking 5 times!!!!  

Suggestion, don't even ask for a menu, just talk to the owner who will come take your order and just tell him what you're into, and they'll take it from there.

You can't leave without trying the peanut sauce, I sware you'll be licking the plate just like the A1 Steak Sauce commercials.

Don't be surprised if there is a line 20 people deep when you get there for lunch for dinner, but trust me, the line moves very fast and it's well worth the wait."
"We went here on a recent trip to San Francisco after reading reviews here and thought the Sesame Beef was outstanding!  Good beer too!

However, as a previous reviewer has said, it did feel a bit rushed and was very busy.  We felt a bit trapped and were sitting very close to other diners.

If you want a relaxing romantic meal this is not the place for you!"
"Excellent Chinese food in China Town.  With so many choices, the chef recommended our dinner. Enjoyed it so much we went back a second night!"
"Went to this place to eat since it has gotten good reviews, but was seriously disapointed.
The food was just OK, and the stressful service (people are not supposed to do anything but  eat as quickly as possible, pay and leave.)

I would recomend the place nextdoor, Chef Jias, instead.
Better food, cheaper, more relaxed,ie all you could ask for."
"We just returned from a 4 day trip to San Francisco and in retrospect probably the best part of the trip was the two meals we had at the House of Nanking.  Absolutely delicious!  

Our hotel reccomended the restaurant to us.  We walked through Chinatown and when we finally arrived at the address we'd been given, I said to my husband and 13-year-old son, ""This can't be right.""  We stood outside and contemplated whether we should go in.  Peering through the glass plate windows, we saw very basic aged tables and chairs haphazardly slung together.  The ""atmosphere"" was non-existent.  But with adventurous spirits, we stepped inside.  We reviewed the menu but that was for naught.  Our waitress asked what we liked and basically ordered for us.  Her selections were spectacular.  The wonton soup had a bold and unique taste.  We couldn't get enough.  The sesame chicken dish with sliced and seasoned sweet potatoes was mouth watering and exceeded the excellent shrimp and beef dishes that were also served to us.  

We were so taken by the food that two nights later we were back wanting more.  The only difference is that this time we arrived around 7 PM and there was a line down the street of other restaurant goers hypnotized by Nanking magic.

Another reviewer noted that this place does not serve up ""real"" Chinese food, and I say who cares.  The food served here whether traditional or not has a taste so memorable, it has my husband and I wondering if they'd consider overnighting take-out to us in the southeast."
"We went to House of Nanking based on a review on the Food Network and boy were we blown away! Once we arrived, we were set on ordering dumplings, sesame chicken, crispy noodles and a seafood dish. However, the owner Peter Fang took our order and he quickly realized that we were 1st timers. So he said, “let me take care of it” and never bothered to write our initial order down. After munching down our 4 course lunch, we were extremely satisfied with Peter’s selections of combo soup, baked mushrooms, honey walnut shrimp on bed of a Chinese vegetable and fried calamari.  We plan to return here soon and will let Peter order our next meal again! Don’t let the restaurant front deceive you, the food is awesome!"
"We went to Namking on a friend's recomendation. The food was so good it was almost orgasmic. We told the waitress what we liked and she made some recomendations. The Vegitable dumplings were to die for, served with asian eggplant that melted in my mouth. Also loved the Sesame chicken. INCREDIBLE!"
"WOW!

        we have eaten at the best of the best, but let me say this.......

        house of nanking cannot be beat.  you will not be disappointed;

        it's always a full house but we all know why.....the food makes

        a trip to s.f. extra memorable.

        .   and, it's true.......the owner will personally come 

        over and order for you.

        pure, unadulterated nirvana!"
"This restaurant persists as one of San Francisco's dining jokes.  I think it maybe the novelty of going to a restaurant and not having to actually order anything.  Personally, I think the food is just OK.  It's hardly Chinese, I know because I was born there.  If what you're looking for is a fun time, then maybe this is your place, but if you want really good Chinese food I would try the Richmond or Sunset districts."
"It's true that this restaurant is pretty hidden away on the street but it is amazing.  Even with a menu containing hundreds of delicious items, be prepared for the owner of the restaurant to tell you not to order what you want and ask you what kind of meat (if any) you'd like.  Then he makes a special dish.  It makes you feel like the only party in the restaurant but he does this for everyone.  And his special dishes?  Always super.

Could be the best meal in San Francisco.  Certainly the best one I had."
"House of Nanking was recommended by our hotel concierge. It did not disappoint us. Possibly the best Chinese food that my wife and I have ever experienced. Don't miss the onion cake appetizer - it is unbelievable! The atmosphere and decor in the restaurant are poor at best, but it is the food that counts. The restaurant should not be missed."
"The patrons line up on the sidewalk to wait for a communial table. The food is GREAT!!!! is atmosphere is not a great, but it doesn't matter. You are here for the food. Order anything with the name Nanking in it. Or, just ask for a chicken, beef, seafood, etc., dish and let them decide you will be pleased. Also the BEST Hot and Sour soup I have ever had. They actually make it from scratch!!! Not like what you get everywhere else. You will love this place."
"This restaurant does not look much from the outisde. Red/White/Black tiles and that's it.

We stumbled into it based on the recommendation of a resident. We were not dissapointed. The place was very busy (always a good sign!) and the food was fantastic and well priced.

Numerous articles in local papers and awards hang around the whole length of the restaurant which do speak for themselves.

Alot of locals use this place, and if it was here in the UK, I wouldn't be away. FANTASTIC!"
"If you're looking for a true ""insider's find,"" this is it! The restaurant is nothing to speak of physically, but  the flavors in each dish are superb! We went there for lunch on our first day in town (on a recommendation from both our SF restaurant guide and a waiter at our hotel) and returned for a second meal the next day.  The staff barely speaks English, but who cares? Service was prompt and the dishes appealing.

Do not miss the fried potstickers with peanut sauce. They alone are reason enough for me to make a return trip from the East Coast. Anything you order will knock your socks off. All main dishes we saw looked big enough to share, but you may not want to once you take a bite! Wash it all down with a Tsingtao and call it a day . . ."
"I have been eating at this hole in the wall in the North Beach neighborhood for more than twenty years.  The food is incredible, the owner very helpful, but the place is just not clean.  It was remodeled a few years ago to double the size, and painted and upgraded in appearance, but if you sit by the windows where the kitchen woks used to be, you are surrounded by decade old grease.  There is nothing on the menu that doesn't have a wonderful taste, the environment is active, noisey and entertaining, and in the hundred times I have eaten there I have never gotten sick, but if cleanliness is important to you, pass on this choice."
"We get to San Francisco at least once a year and House of Nanking has become a mandatory stop.  I have even planned a long layover at SFO to allow a quick trip in for dinner.  The wife normally does not care for calamari, at Nanking she wanted mine and hers.  If there is better Chinese food this side of the Pacific I have yet to find it.  Decor and service fit this hole in the wall place.  If possible use a bathroom elsewhere before going in.  Still the best food in town."
"I very much enjoyed House of Nanking. They are on Kearny Street in Chinatown. They have a reputation for long lines, but I got a seat right away. My order of chicken fried rics was different than any I ever had. It was very good and very different. My friends let me try some of their sweet potatoes, also very different and good. A real sweet sauce on them. I also tried beef chow mein and that was good. I give a good recommendation to House of Nanking.Sam Wo is authentic mainland Chinese. You must walk through the kitchen to get to the dining room and climb a steep stairway. In past years, some waiter did not speak English so menus were taped to the wall, and you had to point to what you wanted. Not anymore. Now they all speak good English and they are even polite to customers now.The orders are still sent downstairs by dumb waiter which is signalled by touch two wire ends together to ring a bell. The food comes up the dumb waiter a few minutes later. The rice and noodle dishes are still good and all cost less than $4.00. Many are $3.00. The meat is given in liberal quantities and the taste is superb. The helpings are large. Sam Wo is different. It still has some of its rough edges, which make it quaint. 
If you can climb the stairs, I think that you should give them a try. 
You will not regret it."
"Bad service, you basically set yourself up because they put plates and glasses in the center. As soon as you finish the dish they blow it away and with the mouthful still full they put the bill on the table. I didn't tip him."
"Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The dishes are decent, but nothing memorable. The staff is borderline rude. I liked the place, lively and welcoming."
"Excellent food, everything we took (chicken, beef and noodles) had an excellent, particular flavor and in abundant quantity. On the service and practically non-existent. Order on the fly, they bring you plates and cutlery that you have to distribute among the diners and they come back for the bill. At the end of the evening we had to run away because otherwise they would have rearranged us too with tables and chairs. Sin."
