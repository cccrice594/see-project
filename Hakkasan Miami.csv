review
"On a recent trip to Miami, my wife and I wanted to try somewhere new for dinner, and I had read a lot of great things about Hakkasan, both in Miami and its other locations. Our dinner here was outstanding, and I highly recommend it.

When we entered the Fontainebleau hotel lobby, we weren’t really sure how to get to the restaurant, so we had to ask a hotel staff member which way to go. It’s kind of hard to find, and we didn’t see any signs showing the way. Hakkasan is all the way down the hallway to the left from the lobby, and then requires an elevator ride to the fourth floor from there. However, once you find it, it’s worth the effort it took to reach the restaurant. 
Hakkasan has a really sleek and dark Asian décor that creates a high-end and energetic vibe for a meal. The dining room is divided up into a lot of smaller sections of tables, which made it feel more intimate.

Our server was really friendly and very attentive, and he took a lot of time to explain the menu to us and recommend some popular dishes. We ended up choosing three dishes as appetizers: jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, the crispy duck roll, and the crispy almond pear prawns. All of these items were good, with the almond pear prawns standing out to us as particularly great.

For entrées, we chose to split the crispy spicy mango chicken and pan-fried scallops with edamame, along with the spring onion egg fried rice that our server recommended as a simple side dish. The scallops were really excellent, and the fried rice, despite being pretty basic, was actually perfect to go with everything, like our server had said.  The mango chicken was good, but had a somewhat odd mix of spices, which made it our least favorite dish that night (although it definitely wasn’t bad either).

For drinks, I tried their signature cocktail, the Hakka, which is Grey Goose, sake, coconut, passion fruit and lychee, and was great. My wife just got a glass of Sancerre, and also enjoyed that. 

We finished the meal with the matcha bomb dessert, which was very nicely presented and tasted good, although it wasn’t a standout for me. I’m not sure which dessert the table next to us got, but they loved theirs so much that they ordered a second one after finishing it.

All in all, we really loved our meal at Hakkasan. The food, drinks, service, and ambience were all great, so we really couldn’t have asked for anything more. It was a perfect place to go for a fun dinner on vacation, and we will definitely be back in the future when we’re in Miami."
"Went with my wife to celebrate 16th wedding anniversary.

Charlie, our server, gave us the best service we have received in a really long time anywhere.

Once we were seated, Charlie asked us if we were celebrating anything special, and we told him that it was our Anniversary, and he made a mental note of this.

We told him we were looking to eat vegetarian, and we already knew a couple of the dishes we wanted to eat, and he confirmed that those were the best dishes to have (Stir fry black pepper vegetarian chicken, and Tofu, aubergine and Japanese mushroom claypot), but we were still looking for an appetizer, and he suggested the Vegetarian Dim Sum Platter.  We added the spring onion egg fried rice as well.

All dishes were spectacular. My wife is from Hong Kong, and she said that the Spring onion egg fried rice was exactly how it is prepared in Hong Kong, down to the color of the rice.

Within a couple of minutes after each dish was brought to our table, Charlie came by and asked how was it.  It was easy to say that we loved each dish because we actually loved each dish.

At the end, Charlie brought over a beautiful dessert tray with the words, ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate, with french vanilla ice cream, roasted marshmallows, chocolate lava cake and some chocolate dipped strawberries.  

We made it a point to speak to the manager, Alex, before ending the night to express our happiness over the service we received and over the authenticity of the food.

He spent a good 10-15 minutes speaking to us, and that was very nice and very unexpected.

Thank you Charlie and Alex for giving us a special night on our anniversary."
"Hakkasan at the Fontainbleau is a chic, trendy, upbeat restaurant. The food was indeed awesome but the service was spotty. We had the pan fried veggie dumplings and crispy duck roll as starters. Those came out together. Then we had the stir fry beef with shishito peppers and sanpei chicken claypot. Then we waited... a long time for the spring onion egg fried rice to come out. We wanted to eat the chicken and beef WITH the rice. We did enjoy it, when it came though. We had a Lychee Martini and the Mango Flan for dessert. All in all, enjoyable minus the slow speed."
"Another post-covid disappointment.
30% prices increase and lesser quality and service........The famous (delicious as we had it many times) crispy duck salad , was a few flat poached duck bites , plunged into a supermarket ""spring-mix salad"" ( instead of the delicious sprouts) ; a single waiter ($81 MANDATORY tip!) to attend an 8 tables room : I had to get up myself to pour the wine myself to my guests , dirty dishes on the table not picked up , asked twice for more sauces....."
Went with friends who swore how amazing it is but even they were disappointed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful. The restaurant is divided into smallish sections- we had view of beach except window was so dirty.  The room was hot most of the meal despite our request to cool it.  The food was very expensive and we didn't find it that great.  Nothing wrong with it but wasn't cutting edge and anything that wowed us. I wouldn't call it memorable food. Maybe they should decrease menu choices and work on the recipes- wouldn't return sorry.
"Lovely meal here during Super Bowl weekend. Enjoyed the Black Pepper Beef in particular. Orange Chicken tasted nice, but the pieces were way to big to be eaten with chopsticks. Sesame Prawn Toast was also weird. Big balls of the stuff and would have been better more delicate"
"Came here and tried the Miami Spice menu. The food and service were good and the portions were large. My one complaint was that all the food was luke warm minus the duck eggrolls. Also, I would of enjoyed eating my rice with a fork instead of chopsticks. I might come back again."
"Actually, there are several reasons for Hakkasan to be Considered One of the Top 50 Restaurants in the World! The first one being the Francois Baguet, the General Manager, whose hands on dedication, together with his incredible staff, make the dining experience truly wonderful. We love having Stephen McGrath for our server. The second reason is the overall décor and ambience of the restaurant itself, which is incredible pleasing to your eyes,
And finally the third reason - The AMAZING food!!! The Peking Duck is ridiculously good, along with everything else on the well thought out menu.
This restaurant is a must dine at for anyone."
"We recently hosted a corporate dinner here at Hakkasan. We had an incredible evening and would highly recommend a meal here if you're in the mood for modern Chinese cuisine.
  

Adriano’s service was impeccable, each course was delivered with a clear explanation and personality. He was extremely attentive and took note as to what everyone was drinking, making sure our glasses were never left empty. No details were spared. Our Sommelier that evening made recommendations that were a perfect pairing to a fantastic meal. 

We hope to dine again soon!"
"Simply excellent. We went for some of the classic Hakkasan dishes like the Pipa duck and the merlot beef and they were perfect. Sometimes the fact that a restaurant concept has been implemented in several places around the world means that it must be very good and Hakassan is a great example. Portions are large. Two appetisers, two mains and some vegetables or rice are enough, especially if you finish with a dessert. While at many more traditional chinese restaurants desserts (at least for me) are the most disappointing part, at Hakkasan it would be a mistake to give them a pass. Mine mango dessert was nothing short of outstanding. Service was perhaps the best we had in Miami. Friendly, efficient and helpful. If you add to all this the fact that it is a very handsome place, there is practically nothing to criticise. The only small caveat is that it was very loud, though most US restaurants are."
"My family has been several times for the dim sum lunch on Sundays.  The food has always been fantastic.  The servers are helpful and accommodating even to my youngest son who is not an adventurous eater.   I can’t speak to their regular menu as we have only done the dim sum, but we have had great experiences."
food was far below expectation particularly the Dim Sum that in fact made us sick the next day. Drinks ok but too elaborate like the Hakka where too many ingredients are mixed together. Place is dark. I liked other Hakkasan restaurants in other countries but would not go back to this one
"Excellent !!
Food always excellent 
Service always excellent . 
Our server this time was even better than normal . 
We were sat down on time 
I LOVE this restaurant and when I come to Miami each year it is always on my list to visit .
Definitely recommended !"
"We had a great dinner here on a Thursday night-the food and service were on point. We had the chicken foie gras dumplings, duck spring rolls and tea smoked short ribs for apps, the dim sum platter and chicken clay hot pot for entrees and got a special dessert of coconut ice cream and mango custard for our anniversary celebration! Everything was delicious and it was a lot of food. The ambience is so sexy and the chill music was perfect. Shout out to our server Elodie who made the night special-she was so attentive and made us feel so welcome."
"Being from NY area, I did not know that there is a Hakkasan in NYC.  My wife and I were greatly surprised on what a magnificent meal we had.  From dim sum to the main course and noodles.  The only complaint is that we only went with two of us, with a larger group I would have loved to try more of their dishes.  Wonderful experience."
"You will be so surprised by the whole experience at Hakkasan Miami.  The servers are first-class and fun, the food is delicious, you will be in delight with the hot and sour soup as a starter. The pepper steak is amazing and the shrimp fried rice is unique. The wine list is international, a global connection via wine. When in Miami, you must be at the Fontainebleau for the decor, the modernity and excitement. The staff at Hakkasan are very nice. I really enjoyed meeting Elodie and Marcello. If you like spicy, Marcello knows how to make a beautiful spicy sauce that will compliment your dish. Enjoy your time in Miami."
"My group of friends and I went to Hakkasan the other night to celebrate our upcoming graduation from college.

Our waitress, Elodie, was amazing, very attentive, and made our night very special. The staff there is very friendly and professional, and the food is great! The food came out relatively quick and was served and cleared in a timely matter for our next round of plates.

One of the managers also came by to check in on us and was very kind! He made sure we were being well taken care of, which made our experience there even better. 

All in all, my friends and I had the best experience dining at Hakkasan and we already booked to have another dinner there next month!"
"We were recommended the set menu as part of the Miami Spice restaurant promotion. There were plenty of dishes to choose from and we shared all our plates between family members so we could try a bit of everything. Delicious mixed dim sum to start, followed by different entrées and sides. The “vegetarian chicken” with asparagus was one of my husband’s favourite dishes. I enjoyed the sweet & sour shrimp with pomegranate and my daughter’s favourite was the udon noodles with duck. We finished off with chocolate maki rolls and mango custard with passion fruit meringue. It was all absolutely amazing and our waitress Claire was very attentive and welcoming. The restaurant is definitely worth a visit, we certainly weren’t disappointed."
"The restaurant itself is immaculate, well decorated and the seating is very comfortable.

In terms of the service; what can I say about the staff? They were as helpful, warm, and welcoming as other restaurants. Neither of us can say enough good things and we were both very impressed with what we had, which was very flavourful, well presented, and just the right-sized portions. A big Thanks to Sanjeet and the whole team. I would highly recommend Hakassan. keep the same standard of service."
"Our server Elody was fantastic! Besides the food being absolutely delicious I was blown away by the hospitality. A few people in our party had food allergies and Elody handled things so graciously and with precaution. She substituted meals, appetizers and even desserts to accommodate our food sensitivity. She was kind and attentive and we had over 20 people at the table. She represented Hakkasan in such a delightful manner. Everything was cooked to perfection, brought out quickly and taste amazing. Perfect location for a date night, anniversary and even company events. Would highly recommend anyone to check this place out. Can’t wait to go back!"
"First visit to Miami Florida with my mom. Wanted to take her someplace nice to celebrate her retirement. The food was phenomenal! I knew from the reviews that this was going to be good, but when I tell you that I was blown away by just how good it was, we were both floored!! Our server, Elodie, was by far the best server I’ve ever had. She was attentive and made the whole experience so much fun - she recommended the dim sum (pictured) and the honey sea bass. Just delicious. Next time we’re in town, this will be our stop. Best place in Miami Beach hands down. We love Elodie!"
"I’ll admit, I can be a very tough critic with fine dining  and service.  Our server Elody was such a pro, so friendly and so knowledgeable we felt very comfortable following her lead with our orders and she took us on one of the best culinary journeys I can recall in many years.  Everything was so delicious and everything she recommended complimented each other so well.  Literally every bite was heavenly.  Highly recommended.  Don’t miss the beef tenderloin and Peking Duck!"
Delicious and refined dinner last weekend! Great table for our group in what seemed to be our own private room. The menu is perfect for sharing and tasting a variety of items on the menu. The food is fabulous!  Elodie was very attentive and she and her co-workers did a great job of making us feel special and anticipating our dining needs. Fun night with great music!  A great way to celebrate a birthday.  We will definitey be back!
"You’re going to a TAO Group restaurant, so you’re going to expect to have to pay a high price. However, for those whom money is no object, Hakkasan will treat you incredibly well. Our server Ken was relatable, well informed, and knew about the menu extremely well. I am at the point where I would request him again if I return, which is likely. 

For three people, We ordered shrimp, Peking duck, and two plates of chicken as well as some Jasmine Rice, and previously we dropped in for cocktails as well. The bill, with a bottle of sparkling and a cocktail for my friend included and an automatic 20% tip/service charge came out to $317. I think that this price was not worth the chicken, but everything else was presented exquisitely - I think $220 would be a price for which our dinner would be worth it. 

Hakkasan’s higher end mocktails compared to the rest of the region’s luxury environments are surprisingly affordable all at $10 - I remember paying $22 for a similar blend of fruit juices in West Palm. 

I’ve visited only LAVO and TAO for drinks before, and I think Hakkasan is the group’s finest work I have encountered so far alone on the drinks, and even more so on the food. The price point ensures that it will be a rarity for me to dine there, but in all other regards this was a near perfect dinner."
"Went on a date with my husband on Wednesday, it was very lively for a weekday. Steven was our server and  everything from begging to end was excellent. He was attentive and personable and the recommendations he made were delicious. The pace of the food hitting the table was perfect and allowed up to enjoy each dish. We had the shrimp dumplings, mango salad, hot and sour soup, followed by spring onion fried rice, spicy curry shrimp and the bok choy. To finish off we had the mango dessert. It was all DELICIOUS, kudos to the chef. 
Next time we go back we would love to have Steven as our server he elevated the Hakkasan experience."
"I’m so in love with the food here omg!  Literally every single thing we ordered was insane.  The service is impeccable from start to finish.  The ambiance is super cool.  And the mango dessert... if you eat here, this is a must.  It is possible the best thing I’ve ever tasted.  I can’t wait to eat here again!  Thanks for a great night Hakkasan!"
"Our waiter Charly was very kind, professional, quick, efficient and attentive.  Service was truly flawless. 

And the food simply never disappoints, : we had dim sum, shishito beef , noodles and lava cake…. The taste and quality is just everything you’d hope for and more.

Already planning a next visit!"
"Elevator opens into a really nice atmosphere. Music is pumping with great sounds. Great table in the back and once we sat down the party started. Elodie was taking care of us and she rocked it. Our journey was impeccable. She gave us the best service ever. Thank you again 🙏. I had friends from Montreal in town and it was their first time, Wowza!! The food was incredible! I highly recommend Hakkasan to everyone and make sure you get Elodie 💯,  Benny"
"We arrived on time for our 730 reservation and pulled up to the valet at the Fountainbleu hotel. The valet attendant told us that the garage was full, but for $100 in cash he could find a space. Of course I was angry, but it was to be a special dinner at a restaurant that we love, and offered to pay by card because I did not have the cash. He refused, and we had no choice but to leave. As a valued tenant of the Fontainebleau, Hakkasan  should take measures to make sure that this does not ever happen again."
"Myself and my wife went to this restaurant on the last day of our honeymoon and we both thought the food and service was top class. Our waiter Burak( forgive me if I’ve spelt it wrong) was very helpful and was fast to respond to our requests. We had  a few dishes including the duck roll, ribs, tenderloin beef with black pepper and chicken mala and spring onion and egg rice. The chicken mala being my most favourite, but overall the food was exquisite. Dessert was also a treat, between the smores chocolate fondant and the zen stone. The zen stone was particularly different to anything I’ve ever had with a hard shell and chocolate inside with coffee ice cream on the side, beautiful dessert in my opinion. Overall we give it a 10/10."
"My girlfriend and I dined at Hakkasan and all we can say is WOW. Our server’s name was Gil and he was absolutely outstanding. He was knowledgeable, kind, patient, and so attentive to detail. You could tell he was very passionate about the menu and curating an exceptional experience for us. This was an 11/10 meal and I cannot recommend it enough. Please ask for Gil if you go! Absolutely incredible."
"Food was amazing… Stafford, our server, was even better. Delicious, perfectly cooked; fresh, vibrant dessert rich and satisfying. A true delight! But make sure to ask for STAFFORD!!"
Standard was the best. His energy is so contagious. The plates he recommended were fantastic. We loved the dumplings and the fried rice.
"Top notch vibes, fabulous food and even better service from Stafford, good fun and instagrammable photograph skills . Highly recommend, would definitely return."
"My fiancé and I traveled from Buffalo, NY and this was our first time at Hakkasan in Miami. We were blown away! From the service, ambiance to the decor, utensils, music, and of course the food!! It was truly amazing and wonderfully delicious. Hazel was our server. She had a permanent smile that was very genuine. She was equally excited to have us as we were to be there. Hazel is very knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the menu and explained flavors, drinks and pairings. She was enthusiastic throughout our entire experience and really made us feel comfortable, like we made a new friend. Also during our experience, I really enjoyed the music. A ‘Black Coffee’ vibe. I tried to Shazam a song that was playing but the app wasn’t able to recognize it. Seconds later a very sweet young man that was part of the staff came to our table and said he overheard me trying to get the song and showed me which one it was. All of the staff, from clearing our table to bringing our food out were superb! I hope this review gets to everyone at Hakkasan as well as anyone looking to get a phenomenal overall experience. Thank you for everything!"
"This is a belated review for a post cruise dinner in December 2021. We were staying in the Nobu Hotel next door. The restaurant is located in the Fontainebleau Hotel. The food and service is first class. 
The helpings are large so seek the advice of the restaurant staff."

"First off, we didn’t know what to eat and we have a lot of food restrictions, so we were not sure we wanted to come here. I am so happy we did! Our server, Bruno, let us know that there were alot of options for us and even recommended the most amazing veggie chicken. We got other things but the chick was a hit! Thanks to Bruno, we had a great time. He checked just often enough to make sure that we were good and made great recommendations through the entire night! Thanks again Bruno! Thanks to you, I will make sure I am here whenever I come to Miami !! lol sorry no pictures of the chicken, it disappeared so quickly, but here’s a photo of the desserts! Also dairy free!!"
What an amazing experience! Our waiter Stafford was ABSOLUTELY amazing! He made our evening. He surprised us with a desert because he heard us mentioning it was date night without kids …and that’s exactly what was written on our desert “date night without kids” sometimes the service is the highlight of the night ☺️
"We had an absolutely delightful dining experience thanks to our charismatic and amazing waiter, Stafford! His warm personality and attentive service elevated our evening. Not only did he guide us through the menu with expertise, but he also ensured every dish was served with care and precision. The food itself was nothing short of delicious! We highly recommend this restaurant not just for its exceptional cuisine but also for the outstanding service. Can't wait to return!"
"Stafford made our night ( honeymoon celebration ) such a great host, knows all about the menu and recommended us this most amazing dinner. Good laughs as well. Can't wait to come back! Lovya!"

Staffone was great. Best service our entire week in Miami. Definitely would come back. Appreciate everything he did to accommodate our date night
BRUNO was Amazing!! He was extremely patient with me and gave me the best recommendation for dinner and he did not disappoint! Best customer service I’ve received In a while!! I’m 100% satisfied and I wouldn’t have asked for a better server tonight ! 5 stars Bruno! Thank you again and I will definitely be returning and asking for YOU!
"Stafford was phenomenal and is the reason why I will return to Hakkasan again and again. My friends and I were celebrating how we passed our board exams, and he went above and beyond to provide us with an extravagant and memorable dining experience. The food was delicious, and the service provided by Stafford was exceptional. He provided beautiful descriptions of the most popular menu items that were considerate of our party’s food restrictions, and he ensured that we had a lovely celebration. Thank you for a wonderful dinner!"
Amazing dinner. Stafford was an amazing waiter and enhanced our dinner experience. The Chili Lobster is a definite experience.  Highly recommend.

We highly recommend."

The food was incredible all around -- will be back here again the next time I'm in the area."
Food was an absolute 10/10. We had a couple drinks and several plates. The absolute must have was the Crispy Almond Prawns. The staff was soo accommodating and attentive.

"My family and I are extremely satisfied with this restaurant. The service, the food, and most importantly the drinks. I was also extremely happy with the bartender Heriberto he definitely has an art of creating delicious drinks."
"I had the pleasure of dining at Hakkasan Miami for the first time with a party of nine, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The restaurant boasts excellent food, ambiance, and service, making it a must-visit for all food enthusiasts.

The bartender, Macho, deserves special recognition for his exceptional service. He took the time to suggest a variety of dishes and drinks, all of which turned out to be outstanding. We indulged in the Honey Seabass, Dim Sum Platter, Beef ribs, Veggie Fried rice, and various delectable desserts, accompanied by perfectly crafted margaritas. Every item on the menu surpassed our expectations and left us craving for more. Will definitely go back."
The food was excellent. The service was impeccable. Stafford made us all feel welcomed and made us laugh so hard! It was such an enjoyable dinner!
"Such a great experience! We came in with our kids because we are on vacation and our server Stafford took excellent care of us! Made great recommendations, brought our food out quickly as we wanted, and gave us complimentary dessert. Everything was accurate and so delicious. Would come back!"
"The food is absolutely amazing! Everything was delicious. Our server, Hazel was awesome!. She knew the menu very well."
"Great food. Our night was made by the waiter Stafford, an incredibly witty and charismatic waiter. Had the table laughing the entire night."
Stafford is the best waiter I have ever had. The ambiance and service was actually unbelievably good. This made the Michelin star level food look like an insignificant detail in what was an absolutely fantastic dinner. My family will be back
The food is next level - every single bite is earth-shattering good! The drinks? Perfection. The service?! The cherry on top of the sundae. Stafford is the MAN
Our server Alina was fantastic! She took a good dinner to a fabulous one.  Thanks alina for making our night taking a huge amount of time to walk us through the menu
Stafford was absolutely fabulous. We will come here again and again just for him. We will come here an extra time for the dim sum. Everything was amazing and our server was the whipped cream and cherry on top!
It was our first time to Hakkasan and we loved it! We have to shout out our amazing server Stafford!! He was so attentive and caring. I hope ever time I am in Miami we have the great service that we had here. The food was incredible. 100% recommend.
"This place is really amazing for either dinner with friends before a night out or even a date night. Stafford was an amazing server, super knowledgeable about the menu, and kept us laughing all night. 10/10 experience. Get the crispy Szechuan beef 😍"
Stafford was phenomenal! So thoughtful! We came for my fiancée birthday and I had asked if the restaurant did anything special. They said they did small writings on plates and a card. But Stafford took his time to create this board of deserts for her to enjoy and make it such a special moment. I’m truly grateful.
"Amazing dinner, but the service was the best part. Stafford is an amazing waiter - his attentiveness, kindness and banter was the highlight of our night. Will def be coming back"
"Best Peking Duck ever had!  This Hakkasan was very different than the one in Vegas, which had some fushion aspects (or siply dishes that lookvery different than traditiional Chinese food).  For the most part Miami is mostly a traditional Chinese food restaurant, but done extremely well.   The noodles were great as well as dim sum platter.  The only thing I would pass on its the additional duck soup dish ($10/person) as the soup was only OK and one could easily pass on that."
Service was fantastic. Stafford was helpful and just the right amount of attentive.food was perfect. Peking duck and vegetarian chicken were high points.
"Food, Music, Style, Lighting & Vibes! Love this restaurant. Bruno is the best server. Every suggestion was spot on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
stafford was amazing ! the whole experience was great !! i had a great time! He brought us dessert without even asking and it was so good ! Thank you for the best time !
"We had Stafford as our waiter and he was phenomenal. The food, service, and atmosphere were outstanding. 10/10 recommend."
"Bruno was fantastic waiter and the food was unbelievable. Enjoyed each meal, succulent. Would definitely come back again"
Good food but great service! Thank you Bruno! He was friendly and helpful during our dinner. We will be back to see him! ❤️
My friends and I had a great time because of Bruno!! It was a spectacular night and the food and service was excellent. We can’t thank him enough.
"Bruno was a great server, very helpful and attentive. We were very happy with the service and food it was very flavorful 😊"
"Amazing food, service, and atmosphere. The food is upscale and the price definitely reflects that but 100% worth it! Amazing service— thanks Bruno!"
"Peking duck is on point! Bruno is the best server ever!!!

Ambiance and music was great. It has a low key club vibe. Come hungry!"
"Whenever we visit Miami , Hakkasan is a must on the itinerary. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is impeccable. On this occasion, we had the pleasure of being served by Claire. She was personable, engaging, and delivered prompt 5 star service!"
Underwhelming. Any local Chinese restaurant is better than this place.  Food was so bland and so overpriced.  We did not like anything we ordered.  The server had zero personality and was unfamiliar with the menu. Total waste. Would not go back.
"Stafford was an amazing server. Not only was he extremely attentive, he was also very accommodating and nice all night."
"We arrived on time for our 730 reservation and pulled up to the valet at the Fountainbleu hotel. The valet attendant told us that the garage was full, but for $100 in cash he could find a space. Of course I was angry, but it was to be a special dinner at a restaurant that we love, and offered to pay by card because I did not have the cash. He refused, and we had no choice but to leave. As a valued tenant of the Fontainebleau, Hakkasan  should take measures to make sure that this does not ever happen again."
"Hakkasan is legit. Right when you walk in you feel like you are in top notch restaurant. The food is amazing, and Bruno our waiter was amazing and gave us great advice and recommendations. Can’t wait to go back"
"Great Miami spot. Always consistent, food is great and service impeccable. Hazel was amazing and very informative. She made the experience great."
Order whatever Elodie recommends. It was one of the best meals I’ve ever had. The service was perfect. Very attentive and fast.
"Stafford was outstanding. The food was incredible. Would definitely recommend.
Did we mention that Stafford was amazing?  What a great experience"
The Asian food was good but just not really authentic.  Everything comes out to table all at once.  Not very big place and a little dark.  The place is just little dated.  Price is a little pricey for ok chinese.
We dined at Hakkesan Miami on: 2/20/ 24 and had such an amazing experience with Steven as our server that we returned on 2/22. Steven went above and beyond to make sure we had an excellent meal by making expert recommendations on the food and drinks. Steven clearly has a passion for people and the guest experience. His entire aura was friendly and positive and it is evident he enjoys his job. Hakkasan is very lucky to have him!
"You cannot beat the food at Hakkasan and if Daniel is your waiter you cannot find better service!
He walked us through the menu, helped our friend with allergies and is just overall a fun guy!"
"Perfect evening, dinner was excellent and our server, Stafford, was a wonderful person and great server. Thank you!!!"
"Have been to all the new hot spots, but I always keep returning to Hakkasan. We were a group of 6 for dinner prior to going out to Liv. Incredible food, great drinks, ambiance and music. But above all, the service was phenomenal. Stafford in particular was the consummate host - professional, knowledgeable, and hilarious. The swagger was palpable. Made for a great experience all around."
"Stafford was the absolute best! So friendly and funny, but also so professional and was very quick and attentive to help us.  He explained everything very well! The food was also incredible as always Hakasan never disappoints us as it's our 4th here!"
Thank you Stafford! Beers in the future ;) food was great. The setting was nice and we were taken to our table immediately.
Elodie and the staff at this place are awesome! Great place for a date night. The prices are perfect for the quality of the food. This place is a “must visit” if you are in Miami.
"We attended Hakkasan and had an amazing experience. From the food to the incredible server Stafford, we are now loyal customers and will returning."
"Amazing place, amazing food, amazing service. 💯 recommended. I’ve been to the one from Las Vegas and the same exact experience."
"Amazing meal and even better service! Thank you, Karson! The Peking duck and dim sum was amazing!! Great atmosphere too."
"Daniel, our server, was awesome and made the dinner a fabulous experience!!!!!!  Everything he recommended was great!!"
"Hazel was absolutely outstanding! 

We had a large group and she guided us through the ordering process… every single dish was outstanding. So accommodating and positive!!!"
"This was our first time at a restaurant that revolved around a Michelin concept. From the moment we walked in, the hostesses were very accommodating. I made the reservation before hand on OpenTable, and said that it was my birthday. So when we arrive, the hostess hands be a beautiful birthday card that was written. Shortly after, Bruno introduces himself to me and my husband. From that moment on, our culinary experience was absolutely amazing. We enjoyed the dim sum platter and had delicious entrées there after. At the end of the night we enjoyed this delicious mango sorbet and custard dessert. I could not have asked for a more beautiful birthday. Bruno made our night unforgettable. We cannot thank him enough. We highly recommend Hakkasan for an exceptional culinary experience."
"Booked a table for xmas eve. It has a great setting, and overall the food is very good, but...
As a starer I had the crispy duck salad, which was awesome. As main course the Charcoal grilled honey Chilean sea bass, which was good but it was served without any sides. Ok, sides were mentioned somewhere at the back of the menu, and I thought those would be supplemental sides to come as extra. A restaurant, and its chef, this level should compose and offer their main courses with the adequate sides. I I told this the waiter but he did not really care and just said that the sides were in the menu... He should have explained that there were no sides at all with the fish when taking the order, so that I could have chosen 1 or 2... Although this was some downturn, the food was good. However, given the experience and the feedback from the waiter I doubt I will come again."
"This place was absolutely amazing.Bruno took us in and gave us the VIP treatment! 
My daughter has severe food allergies, and he made it seamless with the most delicious choices!
You can't come to Miami without hitting up this place!"
"Food is so so scrumptious 
Loved the shrimp and beef fried rice 
Assorted dim sum yummy too 
Our server Bruno was attentive and knowledgeable"
"Great spot, awesome atmosphere, Bruno our server was great and attended to our needs at the highest level."
Bruno was an amazing server. Our recommendations were on point and he was very attentive to our taste. A thanksgiving to remember!
Went here for the first time and Alina was incredible! She was so knowledgeable about the menu and so attentive. Made our experience amazing! Charlie recommended the perfect sake as well. Highly recommend eating here!
"My wife booked the restaurant for my birthday and we were both staying in the Fontainebleau Hotel.

Great service and amazing food. I would recommend going here for a romantic meal."
"We stayed overnight at the Fountainblue Hotel and dined at Hakkasan Miami.  Each and every course was an experience.  After excellent Old Fashions,  Alina guided us through a tasting menu including Duck Consume, Corn & Crab Soup, brilliant Dim Sum, and a wonderful stir fry Mushrooms.  We sated our sweet tooth with their chocolaty cigar and Fondant.  We have to say that this was a great meal, one our top 10."
"Our server Elodie was fantastic. She was very sweet, so helpful and just all around a fabulous server with a beautiful smile. Great atmosphere, excellent food and again excellent service."
What a great restaurant!  It was our third time in and it did not disappoint. Elodie took excellent care of us and making great suggestions on what to order. She was always stopping by the table taking care of us. The beef short ribs are delicious. We will continue to dine here everytime we are in Miami!
"We had another great dinner and experience at Hakkasan.  Not only is the food fantastic and the atmosphere over the top, but the service was impeccable.  Our waiter, Stafford, was so good the last time we were there, we asked for him again.  He didn't let us down.  Thanks for taking such great care of us!!!!"
"Excellent food, excellent service and desert everything recommended by our server Elodie was the best, thank you. 100% recommended"
"Both food and ambience were excellent. I enjoyed the blackened pepper, steak and onion fried rice. The dim sum was excellent. My friend enjoyed the salad thought it was very crisp and fresh. Elodie our server was great and had awesome suggestions."
Food was delicious. Also really enjoyed the Californian Chardonnay that was recommended by our wonderful waitress Alina.
"Excellent Atmosphere and the wait staff was exceptional. Great presentation to the meals as well as amazing service. I would highly recommend. Our waiter, Stafford went above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was exceptional"
"The experience at Hakkasan Miami was incredible. It was my birthday and they presented me with a beautiful card at the door. The service and recommendations we received from Stafford were incredible and he made sure to elevate our experience beyond just a meal. The food is not to be overlooked and was absolutely excellent, with our favorite being the dim sum. We’d be back again for the food but stay for Stafford’s hospitality."
Claire made our dining experience a delight. She accommodated our son’s food allergies and went out of our way to confirm and answer all of our concerns.  Food and experience was amazing.
"My husband and I dined at this restaurant on 10/6. Our second time here as we were very impressed with the ambience, service and menu. Our server, Elodie, was very cool and attentive, and made sure we ordered just the right amount. It is pricey but the food is excellent. The duck is the best we've ever had and we are ""foodies."" We had the Hakka noodles and dim sum. OMG!! This restaurant is a hidden gem within the hotel and we plan to go back again."
"Excellent food, drinks, atmosphere, and staff!  Our server, Elodie, was exceptional.  She took the time to clearly explain the menu and made many wonderful suggestions.  She was most professional, courteous, and so very pleasant and welcoming.  That evening, she was also ""training"" and that gentleman will also be another outstanding asset to Hakkasan!  We highly recommend!"
"Very nice service from BURAK ! Really appreciate it ! Food amazing, love everything ! Place is incredible"
The best experience and food I have ever had at a restaurant. Our waiter was amazing. Stafford killed it and gave us the best service I have ever been provided. The food was absolutely phenomenal. 11/10 experience.
"Food was amazing.  Restaurant decor was gorgeous, perfect setting for a couple romantic dinner.  Service was outstanding. Our service Stafford was top notch.  Friendly and cheerful. His food recommendations were spot on.  Definitely will go back"
"Our meals were delicious and very tasty, one of the best.   

Elodie was amazing, and so knowledgeable !!"
"The food was on point as always. Check out Stafford! He is the best waitor one could ask for. He's personable, knowledgeable, kind, and has good taste. I will be requesting him on my next visit!  If you want a different vibe with different food, try Hakkasan and ask for Stafford!"
Drinks are top notch and our bartender Elena was amazing! Exited to try the mixology class they offer on Fridays!
"We brought in a group of business associates based on recommendations. Elodie was our server for the evening and from beginning to end it was an amazing experience. She recommended several starters and entrées that we could share family style… including dim sum, almond prawns, orange chicken and sea bass... all delicious and beautifully prepared. 
We appreciated her recommendations and prompt and friendly attention. Our business associates were impressed and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or a business dinner!"
"We had been to Hakkassan in San Francisco several years ago and loved it, so when Hakkassan in Miami Beach (not far from us) advertised a Miami Spice dim sum brunch we could not resist.  The restaurant is very attractive and the waiter - Stafford -  was wonderful.  Miami Spice menu included an appetizer, main course, and dessert.  We were so excited to order the dim sum.  We have eaten dim sum around the world including in China and Japan. This dim sum was clearly not freshly made - and SO disappointing.  The shrimp entree was excellent as was the mandarin orange dessert.  We had gotten Peking Duck for the table - the duck also did not appear to be freshly cooked.  So it was 50% wonderful, 50% very disappointing.  Miami Spice meals should introduce you to the restaurant so that you want to come back.  Not sure that I am comfortable that I will get freshly made food.  There are plenty of less expensive restaurants for that.  I’m sad…."
"I’ve been here many times over the past two decades and it’s only gotten better. Service, atmosphere, location, and especially the food were all phenomenal last night. The Peking / Beijing / Roast duck is likely the best anywhere in the world outside of China. Trust me on this, I’m a Peking duck connoisseur. The dim sum and dessert were all amazing too. Really the kind of meal you’re thinking about the next day."
"I visited Hakkasan for dinner on my birthday weekend visit to Miami and it did not disappoint!  The vibe and décor let you know you're about to have an exceptional experience right when you walk in.  The lighting and music set the perfect stage to enjoy the unique and delicious cuisine!  Ask for Elodie as she had the perfect food, drink, and dessert suggestions and attended to our every need.  Fabulous food and service, highly recommend!"
"This restaurant is the best Chinese restaurant that we have been to.  It was so good that we ate here two nights in a row. We have been to other high end Chinese restaurant, but this is by far the best. The dim sum entrees are second to none.  We also had the stir fry Szechuan beef with mango sauce and Szechuan beef with flower leeks and they were excellent.
I don't believe there is a bad entree in the menu.  Our waiter was Juan Pablo, and his service was second to none. The ambiance is very elegant."
Ken was sensational! Great service great food. The duck was decadent. Mandarin and Vanilla desert is a must.
We always go to Hakkasan!This trip we went twice-Daniel took amazing care of us with great recommendations!
"amazing service !!! The most romantic lovely dinner experience ! The ambience was classy, elegant and so pleasing to spend a nice date night! We went to an anniversary dinner here and Daniel made sure we had the best night . He greeted us with so much positivity and a nice card and made sure to check up on us often throughout dinner. it’s so appreciated that in a restaurant in such a busy location he took the time to give us the best one on one service I have received in a while. will forever be grateful to him , the staff and restaurant for this experience!"
"Excellent food, great ambiance and amazing service by all the staff especially Daniel! Daniel went above and beyond to provide us an amazing experience at this wonderful restaurant. Highly recommend!"
Stay away. The food was great going down but then fell extremely ill with food poisoning symptoms for next 48hrs. We ate no where else that afternoon evening and fell sick within a few hours. It had to be from this restaurant and they’ve not responded at all.
"We are so impressed by the meal and experience we had at Hakkasan. Elodie was our server and was extremely kind and patient while explaining and checking on gluten free options for my husband. The food, flavors, atmosphere and experience were all equally amazing. We will be back for a dinner date night for sure!"
"We had been in Miami for vacation and tried the best the city had to offer in terms of restaurants. While we visited many local hotspots and trendy larger spots, none of them matched the experience, the delicious food, and the human touch that the Hakkasan team in Miami shared with us before we flew out.

From the moment we walked in and met Stafford, we felt at home. Claire, our server, was there for every need, and seeing how well the team worked was just epic. The food! I cannot stop thinking about their cocktails and dumplings. We enjoyed the mango dessert along with the white chocolate dish.

I wanted to share this experience because while we tend to assume that big names are commoditized and the same everywhere you go—and while that can be true—you cannot match the same team and relationship that you build here. When I read reviews, like you, I read about personal experiences. I wondered to myself how many times you would have to stop by to share such personal stories? It took just one visit."
"Must go for Miami Spice Sunday Brunch. Generous, beautifully presented servings. We opted for the Peking Duck w/up charge- but worth it. Lots of attention to detail. The desserts are amazing, though we were barely able to make a dent after the prior courses. Excellent cocktails, too. I had an unfiltered something that tasted like a whisky sour served up. Will be begging ot her bars to recreate a simpler version. Loved our late lunch and server was experienced and helpful in selections."
"WE had an amazing time at Hakkasan Miami! We enjoyed seeing our friend, Claire, she is first-class and she cares, it is always fun being in Miami and eating at Hakkasan, the food is so tasty!

I had 3 hot and sour soups and the peppercorn steak, also, the shrimp fried rice. WE had a wonderful glass of wine and tea. 

Can't wait to be back in Miami and able to dine at Hakkasan Miami.

Have a great time!"
"We celebrated my (big) birthday here and the food, drink and ambiance was so exceptional that we went back again two days later! 

Daniel was an amazing server, he engaged with our children, kept them entertained, explained the menu whilst highlighting his favorites and why, and helped us pick fabulous drinks based on what we liked to drink. We even requested to be sat in his section on our second visit.  

He, together with Sanjeet made us feel so welcome even with two kids in tow. My hubby loved the playlist and Sanjeet helped him find some of the tracks. 

We can’t wait to dine here again on our next visit to Miami."
"We had the best cocktails -and- the best bartender (Matteo) we’ve ever, ever had. We sat at the bar and had dim sum and short rib and drinks. Date night perfection. There’s a live DJ (SO cool) and lighting that makes everything beautiful. We still dream about it."
"Excellent environment, amazing and high quality food, great music, and our waiter Daniel was way beyond great service. A perfect place. Highy recommended."
"Having arrived for a 4 day break in Miami we thought we would celebrate my Wife's Birthday at the Hakkasan Miami, having been to their sister restaurant in Mayfair, London and also to look around the Fontainebleau Miami Beach  hotel.
The Dim Sum was fantastic, but overall the meal was very disappointing, especially the Peking duck $198.00 which was not shredded in front of us as we are used to in London (I like the bones), but served pre-sliced?? and we had to ask for more pancakes and sauce. The bill for 6 people was over $900.00  with wine which we paid but, we expected much - much more.
Stall were pleasant and attentive.
We all agreed we would not return to this restaurant if in Miami again, better restaurants closer by and cheaper."
"I have eaten at Hakkasan all over the world and enjoyed most and some not so. The Miami Hakkasan is based at the Fontainebleau hotel. 

Whereas I’m not a lover of this hotel, please see previous review of dirty rooms, the Hakkasan did not let us down. The food was extremely fresh and the taste was incredible. Not being easily pleased, I am not known for being generous with my praise. If you saw me and my family on Below Deck on Bravo, you would know we expect a certain level of service and we expect quality food. 

The food was incredible and the staff service was excellent. From the reception staff who greeted us to our server, Burak. We had great service from a, knowledgeable server."
Words can't describe this outstanding place.The food is gorgeous but the service was outstanding out  of  this world.  The management deserved full credit for what they are achieving.  Great place Fantastic  food.Keep the hard work going.  Well done to the all the staff members.
We had the Best experience  food  and the service  was outstanding  . Sanjeet who look after us and make us feel very comfortable  and I can tell his very confident  and have a great customer  service  experience  . We will be back again.
"Amazing food and staff, the shrimp rice is my favorite, the dumplings are to die for.
The GM Sanjeet was outstanding in his costumer care."
"The food was mediocre, not worth the trip or price!! Waiter was great!! HAD TO WAIT 45 MIN TO GET THE CAR. Will never come back to the restaurants or even the hotel!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
The food was absolutely delicious. The Duck was one of my favorite things i’ve eaten in my life. The waitress was also fantastic. She got us all of our food so fast and was very attentive and the best.
"Having enjoyed Hakkasan hospitality in UK and UAE, I was expecting more excellent food, but, ended up very disappointed. The food was not anywhere near as good, the wine pairing left a lot to be desired."
"Amazing would be the only word to describe this place. Food is the best I’ve ever had, service was quick (our amazing server Elodie made the experience 10x better); we are visiting on vacation but if we lived nearby, we would come back."
Came in for dinner alone as soon as you step off the elevator  the mood hits you the atmosphere  is remarkable  I was greeted by a beautiful  host named gisela then promptly  right after by the Manger  Fahad  he showed me to my seat and Introduced  me to my beautiful  server named elodie she was so attentive and on point had amazing recommendations  I highly  recommend  seating with here I've eaten at restaurants off all kinds and also work in  restaurants  hospitality  industry  and she is the best I've ever seen and then the food was out of this world came out fast and hot with a beautiful  presentation  dessert  also props to the chef if I new his or her name I would mention  it in here also but I didn't catch it if you are in Miami you have to come here for this amazing  experience
Ken and Roberto Parlato are very kind. I had a great time here and found customer service to be excellent! Thank you all!
Finding good service in Miami Beach is rare… and Hakkasan Miami had incredible service. I was blown away by Elodie! She was so kind and informative and made it a great dining experience. :)
"I went out to Hakkasan for the first time tonight with some close friends of mine. Our server, Steven, was outstanding with his care and attentive service to all of us. The food was incredible - packed with flavor and a beautiful display from the duck to the dim sum! The desserts were unparalleled in quality, too - all delicious. It is so easy to see how this restaurant is Michelin star certified - with its quality of food and excellent hospitality. The GM even took the time to introduce himself and ask how our experience was. This is a must-visit restaurant in Miami!!"
"The service at Hakkhasan Miami was awesome. Our orders came out very fast and the food was tasty. Our server, Burak, was awesome, he was pleasant and knew the menu very well and gave good recommendations.

Excellent overall."
We hung out at the bar a few nights while on our 10 year anniversary and Mateo was the best bartender we've had the pleasure of speaking to in our 10 years of marriage. The food and drinks were incredible but Mateo made the experience 100 times more fun. An incredibly kind and genuine person. Hakkasan is lucky to have him.
"AMAZING AMAZING place! Everything was excellent from the exquisite food and decor to the service. Elodie was our server. She was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. She recommended the Dim Sum platter and the Hakkasan drink. When the food came she explained to us the different flavors. My friend and I had a great time. Thank you Elodie for an amazing experience. Definitely will be returning and requesting her service."
"Great food, great ambience but what made the whole experience even better was our man Stafford. We will definitely come back!!!💫🙌"
My wife and I went for our 28th wedding anniversary dinner .  The food was excellent and the service from Alina was excellent as well.  Had a wonderful experience and would strongly recommend the restaurant.
Always a favorite spot in Miami. Eloide is the best! She gave great recommendations on the food. Almond prawn appetizer and half Peking duck were fabulous!
"Eladie is the best server we have ever had, she was very attentive, friendly and super nice! Food was delicious and the zen stone for dessert was one of the best desserts we have ever had, we keep coming back here!"
"What are people thinking.
Over priced Chinese Food
Service was very good .

Not sure why so many reviews

Soy sauce that came with the dom sum platter 
Tasted terrible so very salty.

We tried to order the 
Shrimp with zucchini 
Came out fishy smelling 
And only 3 little pieces of zucchini.

We sent it back got our check and left

The music was loud it felt more like a club. 

Not at all what i was thinking or wanted"
Not really sure why this restaurant is as expensive as it is and why there are so many good reviews. It was fine. Average Chinese food but not worth the money. Really don’t understand the hype.
"Hakkasan is a must visit when in Miami. We went 2 nights in a row, it was that good. This is not your typical Asian cuisine. They have a unique and well curated menu. The food is divine, the cocktails great (try the smoky Negroni) and the service is wonderful. I highly recommend the dim sum platters and the mango dessert is a light and unique treat. Elodie was a lovely hostess to us and gave great recommendations."
"Wow - another great experience at Hakkasan Miami Beach.  The management there does an incredable job providing guests wiht a fantastic experience.  Shout to to Elody the Server that made our experience even more special.  Amazing Food, Great Servcie and a killer atmosphere.  Gret Job Hakkasan Maimi Beach!"
Had a phenomenal dinner in a group of 9 girls! Elodie was absolutely wonderful and attentive to the entire group. She listened well to food restrictions within our party and everyone’s different wants and needs. We did the pre fix dinner and it was great!
"Food was amazing and so was the service. Ordered the dim sum platter, peppered beef, and hakka noodles- all were great.

Our waitress, Elodie was absolutely incredible. She gave recommendations, was very friendly and communicative. Definitely recommend asking for Elodie as your server for a better dining experience."
"Myself and my wife went to this restaurant on the last day of our honeymoon and we both thought the food and service was top class. Our waiter Burak( forgive me if I’ve spelt it wrong) was very helpful and was fast to respond to our requests. We had  a few dishes including the duck roll, ribs, tenderloin beef with black pepper and chicken mala and spring onion and egg rice. The chicken mala being my most favourite, but overall the food was exquisite. Dessert was also a treat, between the smores chocolate fondant and the zen stone. The zen stone was particularly different to anything I’ve ever had with a hard shell and chocolate inside with coffee ice cream on the side, beautiful dessert in my opinion. Overall we give it a 10/10."
"We celebrated our friend's bachelorette party at Hakkasan, and it was one of the best dinners we had in Miami. Since we were a group, we got a set menu, but it was definitely worth the value of it.  The food was excellent and it was more than we could eat. Service was impeccable, our lovely Elodie was super helpful and friendly, and made the entire experience even more enjoyable. We definitely recommend Hakkasan!!"
"Our server was amazing, she was the only honest person on property that informed us that the ""Service Charge"" was in fact gratuity to the staff.  The pool staff lied to us to scam additional gratuity.  Food was amazing!"
Food was good. Service was amazing. Ambience was nice. I would recommend this for any special occasion
"Friendly service. Food was average..drinks were good, but the food was nothing unusual. Seasoning could have more punch. Blah"
"This spot was very enjoyable for myself, and my clients. The food, service, and ambience were impeccable. Special thanks to Elodie for creating a memorable dining experience!"
Got food poisoning from the lobster asked to see manager felt like I was not believed was still charged for my meal . That night soent it in our hotel bathroom and the next day sleeping and hydrating not the Miami experience I wanted lost a whole day due to this meal. My son is a chef at a Michelin star resort so I know what the expectations are .
"Elodie was our server. She was gracious and helpful and delightful. She gave great recommendations and contributed to a wonderful
Evening."
"Excellent experience!
We had an amazing dinner here at Hakkasan. Our waiter name was Burak. We hadn't been there before and we were almost completely guided by Burak. 
He started us off with some drinks, and then recommended the Duck Salad which was a first for me but WOW. The crispy skin and the dressing were impeccable. It was a turnt up Chinese/Cantonese cuisine. Literally everything we had was great. Would highly recommend! Thanks for a great birthday dinner for my boyfriend and I.  😀"
"Excellent, though I'm surprised at the Michelin star. I found it no better than other upscale, fine oriental food joints."
"What an incredible treat. We had a fantastic evening with great service, top notch food and terrific atmosphere. What else could you ask for. Elodie was the perfect and attentive server. From the cocktails to the Peking Duck to the Dim Sum to the delectable desserts, no disappointments at all."
Food was amazingly delicious. Service by Elodie was nothing less than first class! Would highly recommend Hakkasan.
"Hakasan never fails. Miami has one of the best Chinese food restaurants. We are in Miami very often, several times a year, and we never fail to go there for dinner. Whether they're dim sum or honey roasted sea bass, it's always a real delicious treat. And if you are vegetarian, there is a lot for you. This last time  had an amazing server, Elodie. She was attentive, quick, had a positive attitude, was engaging and overall made the best meal even better! Ask for her next time you go and don't wait to go!"
Glad to be back for our annual dinner!  Missed 2021 and 2022 and thrilled to find that the quality of food and service (shout out to Elodie!!) is still 5 star!!  Our annual South Beach trip always ends with dinner at Hakkasan and that tradition will live on.  Ang & Pat
"the atmosphere the service
the food everything was excellent highly recommended for a nice dinner if you want an unforgettable experience"
Alina one of the waitresses was so unprofessional and rude love this restaurant but the way she mistreated me and my sister and didn’t bring out my food purposely I’m guessing she thought we were young and didn’t have the money for it so she assumed we were gonna share a little plate when I asked her for three orders and claimed she thought we wanted only one plate in her words because “she saw us sharing a plate of dumplings”
"Hakkasan Miami 

Service | family Style | Orange Chicken

Service - I went to Hakkasan to celebrate my birthday with my wife and a few friends. We flew around the country to enjoy the Miami weather in March. Elodie was our waitress, and she was fantastic. She made great recommendations and had the pulse of our table all night, from drink refills to espressos to go. We had conversations with the management team led by Sanjeet, and their accommodations for our group were sublime. We had a terrific table, and the staff signed a birthday card for me, glasses of champagne, and a special dessert — a very classy touch. 

Family Style - The meals were very tasty. It is obvious why this is a Michelin-rated restaurant. The meals have striking flavor combinations that justify the higher price point. We had a dinner for six people, and every meal/snack was amazing -- highlighted by the spicy salmon sushi rolls and the chicken dishes. I would highly encourage anyone who goes to Nobu to do waves of meals in a family style. Their menu is so massive, unique, and tasty that you don't want to handicap yourself with just one dish. It would be best if you sampled multiple dishes. 

Orange Chicken - The most memorable dish was the orange chicken. It had a touch of citrus flavor and melted in our mouths. Our group ordered 3 of them because everyone couldn't get enough. I highly recommend it. It is one of my unique food experiences in the past decade. 

Pro tip - Make a reservation two or more weeks out if your group is over four people. There is valet parking because it is inside the Fontainbleu hotel. 

Pro Tip - give yourself an extra 10 minutes to go from valet to Hakkassan. It is in the back of the hotel and on the 4th floor."
"My family and I had the best experience here! Not only is the food amazing, but the staff was incredibly welcoming, kind and knowledgeable. My whole family is vegetarian and our waitress, Elodie, knew all of the best food that accommodated us. She was super friendly and helped us with all of our specific requests. There was so much to choose from! The veggie chicken and noodles that she recommended were my favorite food I’ve had here in Miami Beach so far! Would definitely recommend the restaurant if you’re in the area. Ask for Elodie!!"
"We had an amazing experience here. Our waitress, Elodie, had the best recommendations for cocktails and dim sum! Highly revommend telling her what you like and having her choose for you!"
"Elodie was our server and made the night extra special. She was amazing!
The food is always great and ambiance is a must.
We had the sim sum, you must try"
"Wasn’t sure what to expect but ended up having a wonderful time. We were with our 6 and 2 year olds so had fairly low expectations but had a wonderful family meal. Our server Daniel truly made the experience memorable with drink suggestions and food recommendations for the whole family. He was one of the best waiters we’ve encountered. The girls loved the orange chicken, the Hakka noodles and dessert."
We had noodles and dim sum.  It was great while being no more expensive than the other Restaurants in the hotel. We got there early like 6pm and walked in. It got packed quick.
"Went here twice during our visit to S. Beach.  Loved it each time, would definitely recommend. The peking duck was outstanding."
Elodie was an incredible server & directed us perfectly w/ her food recommendations. The Dim Sum was top notch. Would recommend for sure.
"Our server Elodie made our experience at Hakkasan incredible. She has guided us through the menu with the best possible suggestions, she was very professional and knowledgeable. The food and ambiance were great!"
"The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. Besides her amazing hospitality, our server Elodie made our dinner unforgettable by helping us order PERFECTLY. Highly recommend!!"
Awesome service and  excellent food!!! Eladie who took care of our table at Hakassan was amazing! Highly recommend!
Delicious and refined dinner last weekend! Great table for our group in what seemed to be our own private room. The menu is perfect for sharing and tasting a variety of items on the menu. The food is fabulous!  Elodie was very attentive and she and her co-workers did a great job of making us feel special and anticipating our dining needs. Fun night with great music!  A great way to celebrate a birthday.  We will definitey be back!
"Our server Elody was fantastic! Besides the food being absolutely delicious I was blown away by the hospitality. A few people in our party had food allergies and Elody handled things so graciously and with precaution. She substituted meals, appetizers and even desserts to accommodate our food sensitivity. She was kind and attentive and we had over 20 people at the table. She represented Hakkasan in such a delightful manner. Everything was cooked to perfection, brought out quickly and taste amazing. Perfect location for a date night, anniversary and even company events. Would highly recommend anyone to check this place out. Can’t wait to go back!"
"Great food and overall experience!
Would definitely go again.
Cocktails were fun and wanted to try more!"
"Elevator opens into a really nice atmosphere. Music is pumping with great sounds. Great table in the back and once we sat down the party started. Elodie was taking care of us and she rocked it. Our journey was impeccable. She gave us the best service ever. Thank you again 🙏. I had friends from Montreal in town and it was their first time, Wowza!! The food was incredible! I highly recommend Hakkasan to everyone and make sure you get Elodie 💯,  Benny"
Unbelievably awesome place. My favorite restaurant in the world. Food was amazing! Drinks are superb. The attention by the staff (especially Elodie) was perfect.
"We visited Hakkasan to celebrate a birthday and had one of the best meals and service I’ve had in Miami. Well worth the effort to book in advance. The cocktails were fun and tasty and the food was out of this world. The only difficulty we had was deciding what to get. Claire was our server, she was amazing and with her help we opted for the Dim Sum Platter, half peking duck(a must), the French Beans ends (heavenly) and we were persuaded to try the honey sea bass, a first for both of us. Delicious! Highly recommended! And we somehow still found room for birthday chocolate fondant cake not to be missed."
"Went on a date with my husband on Wednesday, it was very lively for a weekday. Steven was our server and  everything from begging to end was excellent. He was attentive and personable and the recommendations he made were delicious. The pace of the food hitting the table was perfect and allowed up to enjoy each dish. We had the shrimp dumplings, mango salad, hot and sour soup, followed by spring onion fried rice, spicy curry shrimp and the bok choy. To finish off we had the mango dessert. It was all DELICIOUS, kudos to the chef. 
Next time we go back we would love to have Steven as our server he elevated the Hakkasan experience."
"We always visit Hakkasan when in Miami.  It never disappoints.  However, our food wasn't quite as impressive as in past visits.  While good, it seemed to lack some spark.  Shrimp fried rice wasn't up to the normal standards, and the stir fried beef has been better.  However, our dinner was nonetheless terrific, and we will for sure return again and again."
"The service was amazing Juan Pablo and Charley did an amazing job the food was super tasty , the ambiance and music spectacular! Would definitely come again! Celebrates our 15 years anniversary! ❤️❤️❤️"
"We truly enjoyed our evening out at Hakkasan!! Our server, Elodie made our experience the best we have had ever. The food was incredible. We had a few allergies amongst our party of 6. Elodie was thoroughly careful. She made sure we were all safe and Comfortable. Everyone enjoyed their choices.
The best we had was the Mango Beef, the orange chicken, the beef rice. All the desserts were phenomenal. 
Highly recommend Hakkasan. 
Thank you Elodie!!"
"Jayca was our server at Hakkasan this past Christmas evening and we had such a wonderful meal. She was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and made a real difference with our large party. I highly recommend the restaurant and ask for Jayca!"
"I’ll admit, I can be a very tough critic with fine dining  and service.  Our server Elody was such a pro, so friendly and so knowledgeable we felt very comfortable following her lead with our orders and she took us on one of the best culinary journeys I can recall in many years.  Everything was so delicious and everything she recommended complimented each other so well.  Literally every bite was heavenly.  Highly recommended.  Don’t miss the beef tenderloin and Peking Duck!"
Great service from Jayce and excellent food. Atmosphere is the finest. Can’t wait to come back soon and have more of the delicious hot and sour soup
"First visit to Miami Florida with my mom. Wanted to take her someplace nice to celebrate her retirement. The food was phenomenal! I knew from the reviews that this was going to be good, but when I tell you that I was blown away by just how good it was, we were both floored!! Our server, Elodie, was by far the best server I’ve ever had. She was attentive and made the whole experience so much fun - she recommended the dim sum (pictured) and the honey sea bass. Just delicious. Next time we’re in town, this will be our stop. Best place in Miami Beach hands down. We love Elodie!"
"The atmosphere was romantic and warm but still family friendly. The food was incredible! My wife eats a plant-based diet, and she loved it! There were great options for her which normally doesn't happen. Claire, our server, was top notch! She was extremely helpful with dinner and cocktail options. We loved her!! We're definitely BIG fans and already looking forward to returning!!

P.S. The birthday card from Hakkasan was a beautiful touch!"
"We ate here a few days ago and the food was amazing !!! Our server, Elodie, was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable - All of her recommendations were spot on (especially the wagyu 😍) Will definitely come back here again!"
"This is not you typical fast pace eatery... it's a very nice vibe, techno out, loud heart pumping music, dark flow, and great ambiance!!!

The food was very good. Tasty, attractive, hitting the tastebuds with delight and very pricey!!!

We ordered a bottle of wine, a Flowers Chardonnay, followed by the dim sum platter to share, Peking duck with wraps, hot pot chicken, tenderloin beef in fried birds nest and shrimp fried rice. All of the dishes were very good!!! The server thought this was a lot of food for two, but we knocked it out of the park and left there full with happiness!!!

We were sitting at the bar waiting for our drinks and we were reminiscing about the same named restaurant while we where in Dubai. The bar was the same walls, lighting, style and decor!!! Glad we got a chance to dine in both locations now!

Truly a fun, delish, excellent dining experience!!! I would say it's pricey but worth it! We love this place and will def come back. Yes it is under the Fountaine Bleu hotel where you have to walk through the lobby and do some interesting people watching all geared up for Saturday night!!!

We will be back!!!🥢🥢🥢"
Stafford is the best server ever. Roberto an incredibile manager and the food is great. Highly recommend
Stanford gave us the best service. He made the total experience. He was classy as ****. He had the best energy and made the perfect recommendations. We love Stanford!! and we love Hakkasan.
Special evening with attentive service by Elodie. Course after course of delightful and flavorful preparations. What a phenomenal way to be immersed into the best of Haute Chinese cuisine!!!
"Everything was A+. The cocktails, appetizers, soup, and entrees.  Everything we had tasted amazing. The atmosphere is cool too."
"I had dinner with my girlfriends at Hakkasan, celebrating my engagement. The food was special, the atmosphere wonderful, the service superlative. Elodie made sure we had an impeccable service and a memorable night. I was so grateful and can't wait to come back!"
"My family and I decided to go out to dinner for Thanksgiving this year and it was well worth it! Jayca was extremely attentive, sweet, and her recommendations were spot on. The food was delectable and will definitely be returning for more."
Incredible food and excellent service by Jayca the ingredients and the kitchen are superb!. The music and ambient are great!
"My wife and I came to Hakkasan for dinner on 11/16/2022.  This restaurant is located in the Fontainebleau Resort, which is a HUGE facility.  They only offer valet parking, so be prepared if you drive or find somewhere else to park nearby.  It was so big here that we had to ask directions!  My wife was dressed fine, but I was fairly underdressed for this level of restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic service we received with the way I was dressed, not having a reservation, and it being a busy dinner time.  We were immediately seated by a very pleasant hostess and greeted quickly by our waitress (Claire).  She was very attentive, but not intrusive throughout the meal.  The menu here is limited and everything is a la carte.  We ordered the Sanpei Chicken, Spicy Lamb, Four Style Vegetables, and Hakka Noodles.  The food came out pretty quickly and was obviously freshly made.  The food was very good, but portions are a little small.  Our 4 dishes were about the right amount of food for 2 moderately hungry people.  The atmosphere is really nice, the restaurant clean as a whistle, and service welcoming and top-notch.  We both felt very comfortable here and would come back again.  This was one of our best experiences in the Miami area.  If you are in the area, I would check it out."
"Best Cantonese restaurant in Miami a bit pricy but worth every penny, amazing staffs and management team, hats off to you guys will keep on coming back and bring more people."
"Is venture to say Hakkasan has the best Cantonese food in the world, but it’s not just the food that makes it amazing, the ambience and the service play a big role too. We got there early to enjoy drinks at the bar and Camilo was not only an expert mythologist, but a mind reader too! Just tell him what you like and he’ll make you the best cocktail you’ve ever tried. We got sat with Elodie who was not only extremely friendly and welcoming, but also very knowledgeable. She made some great menu recommendations and was super attentive to our table the whole night. Needless to say, dining at Hakkasan it always a wonderful experience. Craving to go back since the moment I walked out the door."
"This review is to rant and rave about your server Elodie. I’ve been living in MIA now over a year and she has provided the best customer service I’ve experienced since living here. Not only was she knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations but she chased me all the way down the different floors to return my credit card to me! This NEVER happens in MIA. 

Elodie deserves recognition and raise! Thank you for everything!"
"The restaurant itself is immaculate, well decorated and the seating is very comfortable.

In terms of the service; what can I say about the staff? They were as helpful, warm, and welcoming as other restaurants. Neither of us can say enough good things and we were both very impressed with what we had, which was very flavourful, well presented, and just the right-sized portions. A big Thanks to Sanjeet and the whole team. I would highly recommend Hakassan. keep the same standard of service."
"Superb service from our waiter, amazing quality of food, Charly the sommelier and Sanjeet the manager treat us like family every time we come to the restaurant. It’s our second home. If you are looking for the quality Chinese food Hakkasan is the place."
"Never disappointed by Hakkasan, great food, great service, great location, amazing atmosphere. I’ll be back and back and back"
"We had an incredible dinner at Hakkasan. The flavors and the presentations were spot on. Additionally, our waiter, Alesssandro made fantastic recommendations and made us feel extra comfortable. Will definitely be back soon!"
"We adventured way off the menu and did the exclusive Taste of Hakkasan!
Only the duck comes from the main menu everything else is a unique slice of this amazing Cantonese foundational food experience.  Elodie had us drooling once we said we were up for trying ""whatever the chef wanted.""  Starting with the amazing (and unique...I mean, Edamame dumplings?) dumplings to the out of this world sake pairs (thanks Brian).  Cannot recommend enough this fixed menu option!"
"My friends and I planned a beautiful day at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach. We went to the gym, spa, and pool. We finished the day at Hakkasan restaurant. My first time there. We had an amazing experience. We decided to try the Miami spice menu, and everything was delicious. I must say what made our night even more special was our hostess Elodie. She was attentive, courteous, and explained everything in the menu. We mentioned we were all nurses, and she expressed her admiration for our profession, and made us feel extra welcomed and appreciated. I am definitely coming back."
"I have been there few times as the food is delicious. I was alone and was with my sister.
The service is extraordinary. Special thanks to Elodie, John and Matteo. Hope i write names right. 
I will sure come back."
"Miami Spice dinner was amazing, we had Dim Sum platter, Crispy Almond prawn, green salad with mango for appetizers.  The food was delicious and service spectacular. Thank you Elodie for making this experience very pleasant 😊"
"We were recommended the set menu as part of the Miami Spice restaurant promotion. There were plenty of dishes to choose from and we shared all our plates between family members so we could try a bit of everything. Delicious mixed dim sum to start, followed by different entrées and sides. The “vegetarian chicken” with asparagus was one of my husband’s favourite dishes. I enjoyed the sweet & sour shrimp with pomegranate and my daughter’s favourite was the udon noodles with duck. We finished off with chocolate maki rolls and mango custard with passion fruit meringue. It was all absolutely amazing and our waitress Claire was very attentive and welcoming. The restaurant is definitely worth a visit, we certainly weren’t disappointed."
"Service was spectacular, food was amazing, portions were abundant, and cocktails sooooo good and refreshing"
"You will be so surprised by the whole experience at Hakkasan Miami.  The servers are first-class and fun, the food is delicious, you will be in delight with the hot and sour soup as a starter. The pepper steak is amazing and the shrimp fried rice is unique. The wine list is international, a global connection via wine. When in Miami, you must be at the Fontainebleau for the decor, the modernity and excitement. The staff at Hakkasan are very nice. I really enjoyed meeting Elodie and Marcello. If you like spicy, Marcello knows how to make a beautiful spicy sauce that will compliment your dish. Enjoy your time in Miami."
"We had a great dinner here on a Thursday night-the food and service were on point. We had the chicken foie gras dumplings, duck spring rolls and tea smoked short ribs for apps, the dim sum platter and chicken clay hot pot for entrees and got a special dessert of coconut ice cream and mango custard for our anniversary celebration! Everything was delicious and it was a lot of food. The ambience is so sexy and the chill music was perfect. Shout out to our server Elodie who made the night special-she was so attentive and made us feel so welcome."
"Came here a few years ago and was so excited to take our family along for a tasty meal. Firstly arrived early as I love the bar but was told we didn’t have time and had to go straight to our table, ok no biggy. Was placed on a table in the annexe which was freezing so we asked to move. We were then placed in the main restaurant next to the most loudest group of friends that were screaming and so raucous we couldn’t hear anything and the staff didn’t interject.  Luckily they left after 30 minutes to a cheer from all the diners around us, honestly it was god awful.
Next the menu was really reduced for vegetarians, so only had a main course. 
Tasty but small portions for the price. 
Did not end up going to the bar due to our ears still ringing."
"This restaurant is so amazing the staff are lovely and so friendly.
We were celebrating because that morning my partner proposed to me then booked this restaurant .
The staff made our celebration amazing and can’t thank them enough .
The food was so tasty we had starters and main I love the fact everything is sharing as me and my partner share most of our meals because we can never decide what we want .
 Defo recommend this beautiful restaurant"
"Food is good except the fried rice.... Needed more flavor they have a dress code here they also have other resturants in the hotel too...

They add 18 percent tip to the bill"
"With Elodie as our waitress, she made our experience like no other. It is hard to find people like her, that she loves what she does and loves treating people with care. Every single table she was serving, she was consistently attending to them. If you want a nice experience, request her for your table! You will not be disappointed! She is just amazing and goes above and beyond her job description!"
"We had an incredible experience at Hakkasan and Elodie, our server was beyond amazing!  She was so thoughtful, helpful and truly made the experience even that much better!"
"Another post-covid disappointment.
30% prices increase and lesser quality and service........The famous (delicious as we had it many times) crispy duck salad , was a few flat poached duck bites , plunged into a supermarket ""spring-mix salad"" ( instead of the delicious sprouts) ; a single waiter ($81 MANDATORY tip!) to attend an 8 tables room : I had to get up myself to pour the wine myself to my guests , dirty dishes on the table not picked up , asked twice for more sauces....."
Elodie was a great waitress! She made our night and the food was absolutely amazing!!! Definitely request Elodie if you’re coming here
"The best food, drinks, and service!! Definitely recommend to everyone. Put in a request for Elodie - best waitress i’ve had in a while!!"
"Our experience was made memorable by the excellent and professional service by Stafford, our server. I highly recommend this restaurant and by all means ask to be seated in Stafford’s section."
Amazing experience and service all because of Elodie. She makes the experience 10X better. Thank you for your service and beauty.
Thank you heriberto for suggesting good food and we really enjoyed the place and food. I highly recommend this restaurant to try Asian cuisine food.
"Outstanding food, definitely a 5 star rating, we only give 4 because the team was not very friendly, we didn’t really feel welcome. The location is great, an experience you should not miss."
Don’t try to come without a reservation you’ll be turned away. Bad way to treat potential customers.. when the restaurant is literally vacant.
Had a great dinner experience with the family. Nice ambiance and decor. Very friendly staff. Both the seafood and the vegetarian dim sum platters were delicious. Can also highly recommend the Peking duck.
"My group of friends and I went to Hakkasan the other night to celebrate our upcoming graduation from college.

Our waitress, Elodie, was amazing, very attentive, and made our night very special. The staff there is very friendly and professional, and the food is great! The food came out relatively quick and was served and cleared in a timely matter for our next round of plates.

One of the managers also came by to check in on us and was very kind! He made sure we were being well taken care of, which made our experience there even better. 

All in all, my friends and I had the best experience dining at Hakkasan and we already booked to have another dinner there next month!"
"SUCH AN AMAZING DINING EXPERIENCE!! The staff is the best in miami and will make the experience even better and so fun!! Elodie and Francois are amazing!! Went here with my girlfriends and got to share such fun plates and desserts! ORDER both dim sums (so worth), the drinks amazing, and don't miss the desserts!!"
The best dining experience I ever had! Not only the food was amazing but the service was increbidle! We celebrated our graduation and we are coming back next week. We had the best night of our lives.
"Amazing food, as always in Hakassan. The recommendation of the wine was also excellent. The service was great. Definitely recommend!"
"Chef Loo is at the creator behind the modern interpretation of the Cantonese cuisine at Hakkasan Miami.  Personally I’ve been gaga about Hakkasan for many years after I ate at the Hakkasan at Hanway Place in London, one of its first Franchise and also one of the Michelin Star restaurants in London. So needless to say the expectations were enormous. The restaurant is in the 4th floor of the very posh and gorgeous Fontainebleau. Its a tad bit confusing when you go in to the hotel at first as there are a few restaurants in the hotel premises. The lift to the 4th floor takes you directly to Hakkasan . Reservation is a good idea because the place was busy. We had reserved through Open Table. The decor is contemporary Chinese with its carved wooden screens and lattice work. It looks really glamorous similar to the one in London. 

What we ate: 

Hakka noodles with mushrooms and chives- this was delicious. Those mushrooms looked like enoki and they were a perfect accompaniment to the Hakka noodles. I wish there was some heat like the Indo-Chinese version of Hakka noodles available in the streets of India though. 

Sautéed diced chicken with dried chili in 'Szechuan' style- the dried chili was actually Kashmiri chili so had 0 heat. While the food tasted good, it would have benefited from some heat. 

Crispy Orange Chicken - this was a glorified version of fried chicken- light but simply no flavor inside the chicken. The presentation was 10/10 with the reduced orange sauce with a sprinkle of black and white sesame seeds not only looked amazing, it was delicious too. But did it compensate for the enormous pieces of chicken that just sat there on the plate. The bigger pieces were dry. Either the chicken pieces needed to be smaller or the sauce more generous. 

The desserts were amazing: Mango Custard with grapefruit, calamansi and coconut sorbet was absolutely amazing. 

Zen Stone had layers of milk chocolate, mousse, praline crunch and a white coffee ice cream. 

I must say, while the entrée was a bit underwhelming compared to our expectations, the desserts made up for it. 

PS: The roast duck looked amazing and I wish I ordered that instead. I would love to try something else next time."
My mom and I walked-in to the restaurant on a Monday and were happily seated at the bar for dinner. The food was all amazing (especially the mango and s’mores desserts) and our server Heriberto made it a memorable night. He had great recommendations and was extremely polite and friendly! We would totally come back just to sit at the bar with Heriberto again- great service!
"HAKKASAN, Fontainebleau Miami Beach used to be open for lunch on weekends with a great dumpling menu. Nowadays it is open for dinner only and few menu offers…, a bit restrictive. I long for the FULL Dim Sum menu."
"Highly recommend this place.  Great food, great trendy music and dim fun ambiance.  Restaurant is located in the Fontainebleau hotel which is also beautiful.  Fun date night."
"We recently hosted a corporate dinner here at Hakkasan. We had an incredible evening and would highly recommend a meal here if you're in the mood for modern Chinese cuisine.
  

Adriano’s service was impeccable, each course was delivered with a clear explanation and personality. He was extremely attentive and took note as to what everyone was drinking, making sure our glasses were never left empty. No details were spared. Our Sommelier that evening made recommendations that were a perfect pairing to a fantastic meal. 

We hope to dine again soon!"
No idea what this is.  It’s the quality of Panda Express and a high price.  I assume this restaurant is here so if someone wants to eat in the hotel and the other restaurants are booked they have a place to go.
"Our family really enjoyed this. We weren't familiar with the menu so our waiter made some recommendations. The food comes family style for all to share. We got the Dim Sum, Duck Spring Rolls and Jasmine short rib apps. All were delicious. Peking Duck, Honey grilled sea bass and Szechuan chicken were all delicious entrees., We had a nice feast with an abundance of different flavors. We all enjoyed it."
"We've dined here before, as well as at Hakkasan London, and we've never been disappointed.  We opted for the tasting menu,  and one person at our table opted for the wine pairing---and boy, we are glad he did!  We ended up ordering what our terrific waiter had recommended.  It melded perfectly with the food.  The portion sizes were generous, and oh so tasty!  The spices and nuances of flavor in each course were exceptional.  Highly recommend!"
"We stayed next door at the Eden Roc and some friends suggested Hakkasan next door at the Fountainbleu for great dim sum.  First of all the ambiance when you walk in is gorgeous.  Then Daniel our server was so friendly and helpful with our choices.  We had a late lunch and we’re only hungry for dim sum appetizers, which were so delicious!"
"We did the fixed menu and it was great.  Plenty of food that came out at a great pace.  Our server was Ernesto and he was terrific.  We were stuffed by the time we left. 
The decor and vibe were also unique.  I recommend to anyone."
"Came here and tried the Miami Spice menu. The food and service were good and the portions were large. My one complaint was that all the food was luke warm minus the duck eggrolls. Also, I would of enjoyed eating my rice with a fork instead of chopsticks. I might come back again."
We were staying at the hotel so decided to try. What a lovely experience. The ambiance was on point and the food was excellent! We loved everything we ordered. Definitely get the s’mores dessert. Advise making a reservation also.
"First time in Miami, stayed at the fountainebleau with a friend. We had dinner at the Hakkasan and our Waiter Daniel B was amazing!! He was thoroughly knowledgeable about the food and drinks. He takes into consideration your preference when suggesting food and drinks. It made our experience here very memorable and personalized! Everything came out delicious per his recommendation. THANK YOU SO MUCH DANIEL B!"
"Dinner at Hakkasan at Fontainebleau Miami
was amazing. I was a bit skeptical initially as it’s a large resort. The food was on point. We had the best waiter - Daniel B. 
Honestly no matter how good the food is, the waiter can make or break the experience. Daniel was awesome !! He really knew his stuff. His recommendations were on point! He took into account our palate and made the best recommendations. He was kind, funny and overall he took our first experience at Hakkasan to the next level!  Will definitely came back again. Thank you Daniel B!"
"Our waiter Charly was very kind, professional, quick, efficient and attentive.  Service was truly flawless. 

And the food simply never disappoints, : we had dim sum, shishito beef , noodles and lava cake…. The taste and quality is just everything you’d hope for and more.

Already planning a next visit!"
We sat at the bar and our server was very helpful in choosing our food. This was some of the best chinese food I have  had. Peking duck was crispy and light
"Actually, there are several reasons for Hakkasan to be Considered One of the Top 50 Restaurants in the World! The first one being the Francois Baguet, the General Manager, whose hands on dedication, together with his incredible staff, make the dining experience truly wonderful. We love having Stephen McGrath for our server. The second reason is the overall décor and ambience of the restaurant itself, which is incredible pleasing to your eyes,
And finally the third reason - The AMAZING food!!! The Peking Duck is ridiculously good, along with everything else on the well thought out menu.
This restaurant is a must dine at for anyone."
Very nice place and tasty food . Pekin duck every year becomes smaller and smaller now only duck brisket including not full duck for sure. The only downgrade. Owners don't become so greedy.
"We went to celebrate a birthday    Absolutely need reservations   Located in Fontainebleau Hotel on Miami Beach

Great service    The crispy duck is a must!  Everything is shareable, high quality and fun atmosphere"
food was far below expectation particularly the Dim Sum that in fact made us sick the next day. Drinks ok but too elaborate like the Hakka where too many ingredients are mixed together. Place is dark. I liked other Hakkasan restaurants in other countries but would not go back to this one
"I’m so in love with the food here omg!  Literally every single thing we ordered was insane.  The service is impeccable from start to finish.  The ambiance is super cool.  And the mango dessert... if you eat here, this is a must.  It is possible the best thing I’ve ever tasted.  I can’t wait to eat here again!  Thanks for a great night Hakkasan!"
"Romantic, dark  great service, great food, excellent drinks, a must if ever in the beach area,also great music ."
"Amazing ambiance & restaurant Manager Francois made our experience very very special. If you’re looking for an affordable, healthy meal here’s what I recommend: the asparagus, the chicken, and Dim Sum! My sister said the s’mores dessert was the best dessert she’s ever had!"
"Hakkasan at the Fontainbleau is a chic, trendy, upbeat restaurant. The food was indeed awesome but the service was spotty. We had the pan fried veggie dumplings and crispy duck roll as starters. Those came out together. Then we had the stir fry beef with shishito peppers and sanpei chicken claypot. Then we waited... a long time for the spring onion egg fried rice to come out. We wanted to eat the chicken and beef WITH the rice. We did enjoy it, when it came though. We had a Lychee Martini and the Mango Flan for dessert. All in all, enjoyable minus the slow speed."
Went with friends who swore how amazing it is but even they were disappointed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful. The restaurant is divided into smallish sections- we had view of beach except window was so dirty.  The room was hot most of the meal despite our request to cool it.  The food was very expensive and we didn't find it that great.  Nothing wrong with it but wasn't cutting edge and anything that wowed us. I wouldn't call it memorable food. Maybe they should decrease menu choices and work on the recipes- wouldn't return sorry.
"The restaurant is beautifully laid out, the service is impeccable and the food is outstanding.  Not much more to say.  You are a fool to miss this place if you are staying at the Fontainebleau or anywhere nearby."
"Simply excellent. We went for some of the classic Hakkasan dishes like the Pipa duck and the merlot beef and they were perfect. Sometimes the fact that a restaurant concept has been implemented in several places around the world means that it must be very good and Hakassan is a great example. Portions are large. Two appetisers, two mains and some vegetables or rice are enough, especially if you finish with a dessert. While at many more traditional chinese restaurants desserts (at least for me) are the most disappointing part, at Hakkasan it would be a mistake to give them a pass. Mine mango dessert was nothing short of outstanding. Service was perhaps the best we had in Miami. Friendly, efficient and helpful. If you add to all this the fact that it is a very handsome place, there is practically nothing to criticise. The only small caveat is that it was very loud, though most US restaurants are."
"Went with my wife to celebrate 16th wedding anniversary.

Charlie, our server, gave us the best service we have received in a really long time anywhere.

Once we were seated, Charlie asked us if we were celebrating anything special, and we told him that it was our Anniversary, and he made a mental note of this.

We told him we were looking to eat vegetarian, and we already knew a couple of the dishes we wanted to eat, and he confirmed that those were the best dishes to have (Stir fry black pepper vegetarian chicken, and Tofu, aubergine and Japanese mushroom claypot), but we were still looking for an appetizer, and he suggested the Vegetarian Dim Sum Platter.  We added the spring onion egg fried rice as well.

All dishes were spectacular. My wife is from Hong Kong, and she said that the Spring onion egg fried rice was exactly how it is prepared in Hong Kong, down to the color of the rice.

Within a couple of minutes after each dish was brought to our table, Charlie came by and asked how was it.  It was easy to say that we loved each dish because we actually loved each dish.

At the end, Charlie brought over a beautiful dessert tray with the words, ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate, with french vanilla ice cream, roasted marshmallows, chocolate lava cake and some chocolate dipped strawberries.  

We made it a point to speak to the manager, Alex, before ending the night to express our happiness over the service we received and over the authenticity of the food.

He spent a good 10-15 minutes speaking to us, and that was very nice and very unexpected.

Thank you Charlie and Alex for giving us a special night on our anniversary."
"We were so excited for a great dim sum experience based on a friends recommendation. Our first disappointment was a really dirty spoon and a dirty glass at our table. Second was that it took 42 minutes for my husband to get his drink. We ordered dim sum (which was actually very good!) and the barbecue appetizer (also excellent) while we were trying to figure out what else we wanted. We did not see our waitress for another 30 minutes from our original order to place our entree order. 
The sautéed chicken with dried chiles was wonderful until I accidentally tried an entire clove of garlic that looked like a chicken piece. Beware if you order this, it is otherwise quite good. 
Last but not least, the crunchy noodles with beef was ok, a bit bland. 
All in all a couple of bright spots but wasn’t worth the money."
"Food was very good, but not the greatest.  The pounding, edgy music was so bad, that I could not talk to my date, and it pretty much ruined the experience.  I couldn't wait to finish the food, get the check,  and get out."
"Excellent !!
Food always excellent 
Service always excellent . 
Our server this time was even better than normal . 
We were sat down on time 
I LOVE this restaurant and when I come to Miami each year it is always on my list to visit .
Definitely recommended !"
"Being from NY area, I did not know that there is a Hakkasan in NYC.  My wife and I were greatly surprised on what a magnificent meal we had.  From dim sum to the main course and noodles.  The only complaint is that we only went with two of us, with a larger group I would have loved to try more of their dishes.  Wonderful experience."
"On a recent trip to Miami, my wife and I wanted to try somewhere new for dinner, and I had read a lot of great things about Hakkasan, both in Miami and its other locations. Our dinner here was outstanding, and I highly recommend it.

When we entered the Fontainebleau hotel lobby, we weren’t really sure how to get to the restaurant, so we had to ask a hotel staff member which way to go. It’s kind of hard to find, and we didn’t see any signs showing the way. Hakkasan is all the way down the hallway to the left from the lobby, and then requires an elevator ride to the fourth floor from there. However, once you find it, it’s worth the effort it took to reach the restaurant. 
Hakkasan has a really sleek and dark Asian décor that creates a high-end and energetic vibe for a meal. The dining room is divided up into a lot of smaller sections of tables, which made it feel more intimate.

Our server was really friendly and very attentive, and he took a lot of time to explain the menu to us and recommend some popular dishes. We ended up choosing three dishes as appetizers: jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, the crispy duck roll, and the crispy almond pear prawns. All of these items were good, with the almond pear prawns standing out to us as particularly great.

For entrées, we chose to split the crispy spicy mango chicken and pan-fried scallops with edamame, along with the spring onion egg fried rice that our server recommended as a simple side dish. The scallops were really excellent, and the fried rice, despite being pretty basic, was actually perfect to go with everything, like our server had said.  The mango chicken was good, but had a somewhat odd mix of spices, which made it our least favorite dish that night (although it definitely wasn’t bad either).

For drinks, I tried their signature cocktail, the Hakka, which is Grey Goose, sake, coconut, passion fruit and lychee, and was great. My wife just got a glass of Sancerre, and also enjoyed that. 

We finished the meal with the matcha bomb dessert, which was very nicely presented and tasted good, although it wasn’t a standout for me. I’m not sure which dessert the table next to us got, but they loved theirs so much that they ordered a second one after finishing it.

All in all, we really loved our meal at Hakkasan. The food, drinks, service, and ambience were all great, so we really couldn’t have asked for anything more. It was a perfect place to go for a fun dinner on vacation, and we will definitely be back in the future when we’re in Miami."
"Lovely meal here during Super Bowl weekend. Enjoyed the Black Pepper Beef in particular. Orange Chicken tasted nice, but the pieces were way to big to be eaten with chopsticks. Sesame Prawn Toast was also weird. Big balls of the stuff and would have been better more delicate"
"My husband and i ate here four times during our week stay at Fontainebleau, all of the food was excellent and the cocktails were fun and delicious, we tried different things every time and they were all spectacular. 

Best wishes, 
Melissa Smith"
"How do I even put my dinner into words! It was absolutely outstanding! 

I took my family visiting from New York to have dinner and everything from start to finish was absolutely perfect. The manager Alex was able to guide us through the menu and tailor it specifically to our liking! It made it not just a dinner but a experience! I can’t recommend it enough to give a try...dim sum and duck!"
"It was my first visit to Miami and on the first evening I went to Hakkasan. Food, service, ambience, everything was perfect and it was truly a great experience"
We went with our family and had an excellent meal and drinks.  The waiters were really helpful with selection.
"Cocktails are great too! Salt and pepper squid, sweet and sour pork, scallops and mushrooms, mango custard, the gluten free parade goes on and on! It was delicious!!"
"My family has been several times for the dim sum lunch on Sundays.  The food has always been fantastic.  The servers are helpful and accommodating even to my youngest son who is not an adventurous eater.   I can’t speak to their regular menu as we have only done the dim sum, but we have had great experiences."
"We spent the New Year’s Eve of 2019/2020 at the restaurant and had a fabulous diner of 7 dishes. The food was was well cocked, unique and luxurious. The only down side was that we was rushed to have our diner in 1,5 hours, which was a petty for a such a nice meal like that."
"The food and ambience were absolutely amazing. Great service and unmatched flavors. They were out of their crispy duck, but they are said to be amazing."
"Cada plato una experiencia inolvidable. Dim sim platter, Crispy duck salad,Jasmine tea smoked ribs,Stir-fry honey Beef, Chilean Brass, Bahamas Monster, Black Poepper Beef, Chicken satay... Just unforgettable. A 10/10 is the right evaluation."
"Love this restaurant. We did the pre-fix menu and everything that came out was amazing!! We had a few vegetarians in the group and they have a wide choice for vegetarians which were all soo fantastic. The service was also impeccable, they were able to accommodate our party of 13 even when we were running late for our original reservation. Would definitely recommend this for anyone in the area."
"this used to be one of my favorite places.
food took forever to arrive. and the place was empty on a Saturday night. 
the taste was sub par at best. would prefer P. F. Chang's
they showed us the duck we ordered and they took it back to the kitchen and waited another 40 minutes to bring it back? 
How can you wait 3 hours for a dinner when the place is not even half full?
Our server Bon was very nice!
positive side: hakka drinks are still good! 
did you changed Chefs? I bet you have..."
"The food was on but the value for money definitely poor, so i would not recommend going there given the prices"
"Never made it for dinner just drinks. Fantastic bar area beautiful inside , great bartenders, best bar in the hotel."
"I was in Miami last week and I had dinner in the highly ranked by Trip Advisor  Hakkasan of South Beach.

The food was outstanding. A combination of plates, essentially suggested by the waiter. 

I’ve been to Hakkasan in other cities by the world but the Miami one really impressed me.

I had some scallops that were melting on my mouth, blending meat, poultry and seafood.

The wine selection, also suggested by the waiter, Talley Pinot Noir and Flowers Chardonnay, were also very good, particularly, the red.

I strongly recommend a visit to the restaurant. The only negative is its location on the 4th floor at the Fontainebleau Hotel. For first timers, you should better keep asking all the time how to get there. It can be a bit complicated and chances of losing your way are significant. But the challenge is worth it."
"Very good 
I am fan of the this restaurant’s design. Only the thing I do not understand- they might have a fantastic view on ocean - can see from the terrasse but it is not used...
Food - is good, wines are nice.
There is the same restaurant in San-Francisco.
I can recommend it."
"Hakkasan is truly one of the great dining experiences I’ve had. One dish better than the next. From the superb dumpling starter to main courses of sea bass and stir fry filet.  The mango coconut desert is worth coming for by itself.  Charlie our waiter and Matt. Asst manager, terrific
personal and memorable dining experience"
"Located inside the Fountainbleau Hotel this restaurant is excellent. I entertained 2 different groups there during a recent conference. The food, wine, and service are excellent. The crispy beef and the seafood dumplings were my favorite dishes. I highly recommend this restaurant. The only negative is they play disco type music a bit too loud instead of the instrumental Chinese music you expect to find in this type restaurant."
"The place was packed so luckily we had a reservation. Even though all employees were really busy, they managed to provide great food and fast drinks. Would love to go back when I return to Miami one day."
"Very nice Cantonese fusion restaurant. To get there, we walked through a spacious lobby of Fountainbleau, with its famous imposing chandeliers, and then we got immersed into the whimsical Asian ambiance. Beautiful carved bas-reliefs on the walls, muted lights, attentive, courteous waitstaff - all contributed to an elevated experience. Food was just amazing, rich in flavor, not overly spicy, delivered in no time and served family-style. Looking forward to coming there again!"
"Very good food! Helpful staff. One of our favorites. Have drinks at the bar first. The bartenders are very very good. Must say that we have not been for a while, which is a mistake😀. For sure recommend. See the pics."
"Our visit to the Hakkasan restaurant was preceded by a phenomenal entry into the giant lobby of the Fontainebleau Hotel. On the 4th floor, the very intimate Hakkasan was waiting for us. 

Two charming reservation clerks makes sure you don’t waste a second: they guide you to the 60 feet, water themed bar hosted by Manon, a very well educated French lady. She introduced us to the most incredible choices of refined alcools and cocktails, including several unique bottles, from around the world. 

The ambiance is very intimate, as most of dinning area is separated by Chinese wooden panels, creating alcove effects. We were there for the “Miami Spice” event and the menu was very refined. We took it all. The service was excellent: our waiter Ernesto, a refined gentleman, was very dextrous in serving us at the table and was very attentive to details. If you can have him somehow, go for it. 

The food itself was just the right portion, temperature and texture. The rythme of service is very good. No unnecessary wait. A very good chef gives you beautiful plates and good food for the taste buds. Let’s just say he/she was a miracle worker! (see pictures). 

At the end of our meal, we met with the general manager, Jean-François Baguet, one of those international specialist that everyone wants to have. He was kind, and inviting us to experiment the restaurant again. We shall do just that. What a charming man.

I am very difficult and I give them a 9,9/10
Which is the best restaurant review I published so far. 

#simonsays #technomages"
"Professional staff, boring food, beautiful interior but way too pricey. If you’re gonna charge that much it should be an informative process with amazing food.  If you’re gonna force people to listen to your marketing of “world famous”  then back it up on in general. There was also a lot of kids so for couples maybe not the romantic choice."
"Went there with another couple.. place looks beautiful with ambient lighting, the staff was very nice...
I dont know where to start with the food! It was one of the BEST dinner experience i have had . The food was so good that by the time dinner was done i couldnt move 😅 i did not want to miss out on anything.  
Soups- Hot and sour soup was good(really good) . the mushroom soup tasted a little bland .. 
For main course we tried 
1) Black truffle roasted  Duck -excellent
2)Hakka Noodle - Excellent
3)spring onion Fried rice - very Good
4)Schezwan styled sauteed diced chicken with dried chillies- it was amazing! 
5)Roasted peepa duck - excellent
The restrooms are beautiful ! The mirrors on the wall are beautiful.. 
Overall im definitely coming back whenever i make a trip to Miami ..."
"My wife and I went to Hakkasan as part of the Miami Spice dinner program. We were very impressed with the food. Instead of the usual menu, they brought out a lot of dishes to share. The chicken with pepper sauce was savory and tender. My wife also like the pairing of sauces for the fish dish. The fried rice with peas and beef was terrific and it was not greasy. You can get lost in this maze of booth areas with the throbbing music which actually makes the place a lot of fun. The service was excellent and very knowledgeable."
"We went for the Miami spice lunch Dim sum menu. It was a fantastic value for $23. We had dumplings, chicken skewers, bok choy, noodles, and dessert. The service was great. The place had amazing ambiance. The bar is large.  The valet is $16 with validation."
"I love Hakkasan Miami Spice lunch, we always go at least once or twice. The good thing, apart from the food 😜, is that they will serve you everything that is on the menu, the only thing you have to choose is dessert. I love the Dim Sum basket and the Mango Custard cream is my favorite 😋 @dinebleau For more of my favorite restaurants and places follow me @naddias_favorites ."
As much I love Hakkasan the Miami Spice menu was disappointing 2 slides of chicken and bok choy was which we left desserts were excellent but not worth it
"It is a great place for end your day, it’s delicious and you can try several options and also to share. Duck rolls, you can chose meat,pork and chicken in different styles and desserts are amazing and tasty.

Service was very good."
"I strongly recommend this place, take advantage to try out the Dim Sum Miami Spice on Saturday and Sunday for lunch and good for any budget.  The best place if you want authentic Cantonese cuisine.  Everyone here are so polite and friendly and take pride. We enjoyed every moment, thank you."
"I really enjoyed my chicken dish and the accompanied fried rice. Both were presented beautifully and had a lot of flavor. My husband found the orange chicken to be rather challenging as the orange flavor overpowered the chicken and other seasonings. There was also a more orange slices on the plate then chicken. The restaurant itself was really cool and interesting. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, which made the ordering process easier as we didn't fully understand that the sides were towards the back of the menu and meant to be shared. Worth checking out when at the Fontainebleau"
"We are regulars with Hakkasan and especially we enjoy their weekend lunch.  The food offering was substantial and the best part of it is the taste is always the same and all the dishes offered during the Miami Spice lunch were simply awesome. Our lunch experience was made even better because of our waiter Charlie, who was not only very friendly but also suggested some special house made hot sauces which were excellent. Will definitely go back during there again."
"My husband and I along with my parents, sister and niece recently had dinner here and it was excellent. Great service and wonderful menu. Everything had great flavor and was well presented. Desserts were also delicious. Perfect portion sizes meaning little waste. We definitely recommend this great restaurant when in Miami Beach"
"This was one of the best dinners I have had all year and it was simple and easy experience. The gluten free menu is small and it appears to be a la cart. I didn't have any issues ordering and everything came out exactly as it should have been. The fried rice was beyond fantastic. I grew up eating authentic Cantonese fried rice and missed it so much. This was exactly as I remember it, but gluten free. The mushroom stir fry was phenomenal, I just cant figure out why it was $38.00. It individually cost more than any one item we ordered and it was so much mushrooms we couldn't finish it. The duck salad and Szechuan  chicken were also excellent. If you are staying at the Fontaine Bleau or in Miami Beach this place is a must try."
"We reached Hakkasan very frazzled and nerves on edge as our hotel had messed up our car booking to take us for this dinner and we were not sure after the long drive there whether we would get a table or not - we did and we were welcomed with open arms - the service, the food were most amazing helped of course by the great wine we had!
Loved Hakkasan!"
"Before going I checked reviews. A few seemed to think service was on par with a Michelin Star, and that is not what we observed. Upon entering the elevators take you to 4th floor of hotel which is nice. Host was attentive. Then being seated the seats where filled with crumbs. Not a great start. Given they literally just opened our reservation was for six pm. Our actual server was very nice, but did not go over the menu at all. We ordered green tea and she poured it immediately at the table. Tea needs to seep, even the lowest level Asian place knows this. She wasn't a horrible server just not what we were expecting. Food was average. We ordered the veg dumpling platter they were presented extremely well and excellent in terms of preparation. We only ordered one other item because of the service and honestly that item was nothing special. It was greasy and for the price one shrimp cut up with a few small pieces of calamari. If you would like to try this place go to the bar it's super cool and get some dim sum like dumplings. That is where this place shines."
"The food was excellent. I had the crispy duck salad, spicy lamb with bamboo shoots and spring onion fried rice with egg. All was delicious! I wasn’t a big fan of the lychee martini and the service was inconsistent."
"We went there for the dim sum on a Saturday morning/noon ish time. First of all, since we are from out of town and following google map's direction, it's not easy to locate the restaurant since it's inside the Fontainebleau resort. I recommend look for the resort itself. Secondly, we entered on a side entrance with ONLY valet parking. it costed over 30 bucks and after we ate, the valet refuse to honor the parking validation by the restaurant (the validation is a discounted parking rate not free parking). I was told valet parking does not take validations, the discount is for parking at the main entrance? This is not tourists friendly but I can't ding this against the restaurant, maybe the resort itself.
After entering, it took a while to walk the resort to find the restaurant. The first impression after getting off the elevator is that the place has very low lighting. maybe it's part of the atmosphere they wanted to set. Whatever, don't bother me either way. I came here for the food right. 
The dim sum themsevles were pretty (first impression by the artists of the family, my wife and my daughters) and then they are tasty to the point we ordered seconds of several dishes. I am sorry that it had been a while and I don't remember the exact names of the dishes but they are almost all good and nothing disappoints. 
The price is high compared to other dim sum places I have tried all over the world. 
But this is a restaurant in a high-end resort in a major tourist area, I did expect to pay premium for all that. 
Overall, it was an experience the entire family remembered fondly as one of the better places we have eaten. Of course nobody other than me concerned about the price..."
"The Lychee Martini is perfect!...but that was honestly the only thing we liked. We were told everything was family style...so expected decent sized portions to share, expectation was very wrong! The Mongolian Beef has 5 pieces, the Scallops has 4 pieces...and the chicken fried rice was just enough for 2 people but had no flavor at all and the chicken was fatty thigh meat. We definitely should have went back to Stripsteak instead!"
"The restaurant, Hakkasan at the Fountain Bleau, is delicious.  The service was superb.  Would definitely go again."
"We had the Saturday dim sum price fixed lunch. This is a set offering of steamed and fried dim sums and a choice between two entrees, along with a dessert. I would have preferred more choices and varieties. There is also a vegetarian option.   The fried dim sum was much better than the steamed and my wife’s entree of “vegetarian chicken” (made from soy) was fantastic. My spicy mango chicken however was dry and mundane.  The mango cream and coconut sorbet dessert was delicious.  The decor is very beautiful and the service was very good.  Prices are expensive and the 18% gratuity is included.  In short: good but not great."
"We had dinner for our anniversary there last week.  The service is impeccable.  The food was excellent.  When I made the reservation, I mentioned it was our anniversary and they had a card waiting for us and a delicious dessert was sent to us after the meal.  The staff is highly professional.  Definitely ""a must go to spot""!"
"We always tend to have a very good experience at the Hakkasan restaurants! The courteous doorman at the Fontainebleau hotel took us up in the lift to the restaurant, where we had a few cocktails at the bar and then we were shown to our table for dinner. Our server was very attentive and looked after us well. Overall tasty food with a nice ambiance!"
"It was my second visit to Hakkasan, had dinner and evrything was perfect and delicious! Dim Sum Sampler is a must try, as well as the Pipa Duck.
Great service, friendly staff..."
"Great dinner. Had the Assam Prawns, the Dim Sum and the Beef with Fried Enokis. We finished with the Mango custard and the Macaroons. All very good. Quality is consistent across time and places where they have their branches."
"We had cocktails at the Hakkasan bar before dinner which were delicious - make sure you arrive early to have a pre-dinner drink! We had stir fry black pepper beef and Szechuan chicken as main courses with ribs to start. The food was excellent and we also had a very nice bottle of sauvignon blanc. The service was excellent even though the restaurants was very busy.

Expensive (as are most places in Miami Beach) but worth a visit."
"Not only is the food here incredible, the service was top quality as well! Had a lovely evening and would happily recommend to anyone visiting Miami Beach!"
"As with all Hakkasan restaurants, the menu and food are very rewarding and the quality of the food is good, that’s where the good review ends. 

We were a family group of 9 and the service was average, even with a bill at $1400!

The location seems to be in the back end of the Fontenbleu hotel and is not very “nice” let’s say. Our table was located over looking the terrace (concrete) and it was very very cold (so they gave us robes from the Spa😏).

Not worth the money this time, there’s better in Miami, I’d avoid unless you want to be a pretentious like we wanted to be last night 🤪"
We had the chefs dinner for 4 last night. A great selection of food and more then enough. Service was great.
"We visited Hakkasan in Miami in April and were blown away by every part of the experience. Best service we have ever received in a restaurant. The menu selection was full of amazing options, food was beyond our wildest expectations, dessert was to die for. The scallops were HUGE, the Beef with shishito peppers was fabulous! The atmosphere was perfect. What a great evening. Couldn't have asked for more. If you visit Miami, this restaurant is a MUST."
"We had a great Chinese Experience tonight with excellent service and a fantastic ambience, The menu was outstanding and we were served very Quickly, the food was outstanding and prices were very good we will go back for a third time"
Ordered a chocolate martini: fabulous. Vegetarian dim sum selection: extraordinary. Three-mushroom stir-fry: divine. The seabass was magnificent. The chocolate fondant: out of this world. The miso bar: very good.
"The atmosphere at Hakkasan was smooth and swanky. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Initially, the servings seemed small but they were just right. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. The sea bass was flaky and moist. It was my 1st time trying a virgin Hakka. It didn’t disappoint. Bring your wallet. This meal for 2 with my sister cost $142 without dessert."
"The best atmosphere in Miami, and the food is always on point. Our server Ken took great care of us and Alex made sure we had an amazing experience."
"Great service with attention to every dietary necessity immangeable. Staff were so courteous, kind, prompt and efficient. The food was plenty and all dishes were spectacular"
"The Fontainebleau Hotel is gorgeous, as is the Hakkasan restaurant. The four of us tried 3 different small eat dishes and 3 different main dishes and shared a dessert. All the dishes were good, but they were not exceptional; we felt that you could get equally interesting Chinese/Asian food for a significantly lesser cost. To summarize, if you want to eat in a stunning restaurant with a lovely ambiance and great service, this would be a good choice, but in my opinion, the food at Hakasan does not compare to other fine dining restaurants like the Bazaar."
Fun and lively atmosphere. Food and service were great. Wwe tried a few appetizers and a few dinners and were not disappointed with any. I would good back again
I love this restaurant. This was ours second time there with a few years in between and it is just amazing. I would recommend eating about a million of their starters and then literally anything else you want on the menu. Everything was awesome.
"It was our first time ever at the restaurant and it was a pleasure to attend and to have dinner. Our server was Marcus - he was well knowledge and very charismatic. He actually provided us with some very delicious dishes. 

For appetizers we had a dim sum platter, the smoked beef short ribs, and crispy duck salad (let me tell you, the duck salad was AMAZING!) I know it is weird, its a salad, you can do it at home but this salad - is only at Hakkasan. Thanks to Francois the GM for this specific recommendation.

We moved forward to the main entrees, we had the fried rice, the Szechuan style sauteed diced chicken and the stir fry beef with shishito peppers - These plates were amazing! the taste, the texture, the flavor and even the presentation.

We accompanied our food with some drinks recommended by rest manager Ryan Wolf, house champagne and some Lychee Martinis done by Mauricio the bartender. Mauricio did an excellent job with the drinks and some shots! Great bartender!

Finally, Marcus and Mr. Fancois recommended some dessert, the mango custard was my favorite - it is topped with coconut sorbet, grapefruit and calamansi - the combination of all those flavors is mouth watering. The Warm chocolate fondant it amazing too- with banana, almond and more chocolate on top - to die for! And there was another but I cannot find it in the menu - amazing! another chocolate dessert, not very sweet but very delicious. 

The restaurant is kids friendly, business attire, super discreet - we love the atmosphere, the music was smooth and at times a little more fun but nothing loud. Prices are excellent considering the taste of the food and presentation. Their cuisine team do a great job.

We definitely recommended the restaurant and it is worth going several times!

Thanks for the great hospitality!

PS: Restrooms are super clean and beautiful - a picture must be taken! :)"
"The Fontainebleau Hotel has many bells and whistles -- stores, eateries, bars, pools, spas.  It's one of Miami Beach's classic hotels.

Take the elevator to the Hakkasan and you enter a world of restaurant art.  Everything in the place shimmers and shines.  It drips MONEY.

The good news is that even regular people can afford to see how the other have enjoys themselves.  They have a happy hour menu that will save you money.  And we just ordered and shared several different appetizers -- mostly Asian delights -- and our bill was about $100.  And that included what the place is famous for, it's specialty drinks.  Their martinis are exceptional!

If you are looking for an uptown experience without paying uptown prices, then Hakkasan is the place to go.  The food is three star and beautifully prepared and displayed.  The drinks are heavenly.  The staff  treats you like you're a millionaire.  And the restaurant itself is eye-popping cool.

For more travel tips, please check out my popular travel blog."
"We spent a weekend in Miami and had booked our final night's dinner at Hakkasan. This was an experience not to be missed. We were led promptly to our reserved table in a quiet alcove/section. Our server gladly took a photograph of us at the table. We studied the large drink menu and selection of dinner choices and decided upon a bottle of red wine.

Our dining attendant then guided us through selecting an appetizer, two entrees, and a side dish. We went with the assorted dumplings, a seafood entree, the Szechuan chicken entree, and the chicken fried rice with sugar snap peas. 

We capped dinner with the blueberry-filled doughnuts, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served hot from the oven with a dipping sauce. It was a delicious and lovely evening, and everything was perfectly served and paced just right. I would eat here again and again."
Fun restaurant with very good food. On a par with all the others in the Hakkasan chain. The myriad dumplings were particularly excellent.
"We, try the dumplings, ribs, fried rice, and the duck so tender and crispy, we love the food and the waiter's service is delicate, knows how to express and is reliable.
We asked him to order for us, what we will have dinner and everything was very nice"
"Everything we tried on the menu was amazing.
We had to sit at the bar because the wait was so long even with a reservation.  But it was worth it!"
I had wanted to try hakkasan for a while heard amazing things and it didn’t disappoint! Our server was the loveliest he helped us with selecting what to get. My boyfriend is a fussy eater but even he loved it. I had spring rolls which were amazing and then we had the lemon chicken the flavour was beautiful and the roasted satay chicken was one of the best dishes I’ve ate. The restaurant was stunning had a chilled atmosphere would go back in a heart beat.
"We are great lovers of the London originals so were looking forward to a similar experience. Stuck on the 4th floor at the back of the Fontanbleau Hotel it lacked atmosphere, average service and half the plates were inedible so greasy and lack of presentation but we were never asked if anything was wrong. 
London look out these places will ruin your well earned reputation, back to Mr Choi’s for us"
"I always try and come to the Hakkasan in Miami 

Never disappoints 

Not cheap but what is that is quality 

Food delicious 

Loved especially the duck salad 

The service is also exceptional 

Definitely recommended !!"
"The food was the best  Asian food and great service. The food brought me to a different place, and totally blew my mind. This restaurant is the Michael Jordan of restaurants. Please rate this a Michelin star."
"We were a family of five desperately hungry around 2 pm for lunch (26th Jan) in Fontainebleau. Knowing hakkasan to open for dinner, we were little sad, but suddenly saw the signage: hakkasan Saturday Sunday open for lunch !!! We headed straight.. view outside the restaurant- could see the Miami Beach (pic)... had a few drinks, then enjoyed the hospitality of the steward. The bao, shrimp dim sum, excellent egg fried rice, chili red snapper, baby pok choi, and to die for ‘mango custard’ (pic)! Yummy afternoon!!"
A gem hidden in the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach - a flavor bonanza with each course and each dish exquisitely prepared and perfectly balanced.  Try the honey glazed sea bass and the dim sum appetizer.
The food here is so good.  We shared a bunch of plates that were recommended to us by our waiter.  Everyone one of them was better than the next.  Really delicious.  If you are in the area I highly recommend it.
"Celebrating a friend’s birthday last night. Had only previously been once before. Great atmosphere, service, and of course FOOD. Crispy duck salad and dim sum platter were delicious (and that says a lot when I previous NOT a fan of duck). We tasted almost everything on the menu and not one disappointed. It was absolutely exquisite. Definitely recommend!"
"I was jonesing big time for Chinese food and was excited to come.  Maybe it was my expectations (including for some crispy beef, which I don't think they had) or what we ordered, but it didn't blow me away.  Great service, though, in a dark, cool spot."
"We loved it so much, we came back two days in a row to have the crispy duck salad, really amazing! There was something really interesting and elaborate with the all the tastes in the various plates, even the vermicelli with chicken was special. We also had the crispy orange chicken and the beef rice with truffles, and everything was very nice and all tasted different."
"My family and I had a absolutely delicious dinner in this beautiful restaurant. The service was incredible and they really made it a wonderful experience. They explained the menu in detail and made it very enjoyable to choose various items to order. The food is truly something to not miss. Between the menu and the decor of this restaurant, it was a very memorable evening."
We are familiar with this chain since live close to San Francisco and eaten there several times. The quality and atmosphere/service never disappoint.
"We were a party of 4 and ordered the fixed vegetarian meal. It was outrageous!
The seating area was divided into smaller dining rooms. Service was excellent and the drinks were well prepared."
"My husband and I and another couple went here for dinner and had an awesome waiter named Steve, delicious food, and great atmosphere! We loved everything about it, especially the way we were seated at our table but it felt like we were in a little alcove. Or waiter was friendly and funny and gave us recommendations all of which were fantastic! He told us about the weekend brunch from 12 to 3 and I cannot wait to go back and try it! Definitely make a reservation because it gets very busy especially for dinner. Enjoy!"
"I've been going to London's Hakkasan ever since it was opened in Mayfair in 2001. During my dozens of visits the restaurant has never stopped amazing me. In fact no other restaurant I regularly go to has provided the same level of consistency - you can pick anything from the menu and it'll be fantastic. Unfortunately Hakkasan Miami fell far from this. 

What we noticed first that the small eats were not small. The idea in my mind is to order a couple of these but for example the pork ribs were what would be considered a main course size elsewhere. The ribs were generic, what you'd find at a good fast food place. Dimsum were bland, as were the foie gras shanghai dumplings. These literally could've had anything from tofu to beef and you wouldn't notice. If there was foie gras in this, it was a waste of a good ingredient. Stir fried eggplant was soft and smushy, like it was boiled. 

I had high expectations for the black truffle duck which is my favorite dish in Mayfair. It was a bigger portion, the duck more chewy and the skin a bit less crispy. The sauce was good, but only a few random bits of truffle whereas the ""original"" had thinly shaved truffle. The most offensive part of the dinner was the jasmin rice - such a simple thing to screw up. It wasn't sticky, but more like regular rice, honestly you'll find similar rice at a fast food restaurant. It also came in a soup bowl, again a small simple thing that made it less special.  

Service was friendly but not perfect - we were for example not offered more water even though we ran out. When we ordered drinks in the beginning, the waiter also took the wine list from us while we were still browsing the menus, I had to ask for it back.

Overall, I was disappointed and felt like this was not up to the Hakkasan standard which I've gotten to know. I wonder if London is the exception and all other are watered down versions?"
"Went to the Fontainebleau for cocktails and decided to stay for lunch. The food at Hakkasan is simply beautiful, The taste is beyond perfection. One of the best restaurants in Miami."
"I came with my family for dinner. Hadn’t been here in over 6 years. The restaurant is still great as I remember. Good and attentive service. A mouth watering menu if you’re into Chinese food. I had never, not even while living in Alaska, had fresh, yes FRESH King Crab. The live crab 🦀 was brought to our table before being sent to the kitchen. One of the best dishes I have ever tastes. Fleshy, meaty and buttery, what an indulgence. The wine list is fantastic. We decided to get a bottle of one of my favorites, a super tuscan, Tignanello. A  milestone of a wine that went great with the rest of the food, we had dumplings before the giant crab. Expensive, yes, but worth every cent. Not only the food is great, you’re paying the location. You’re gonna be seen in one of the best spots ina town that loves flashy and money. Highly recommended."
"The experience at this Hakkasan is just like any other in NYC or Vegas. Similar if not the same decor and atmosphere. The same menu and great food. Hakkasan serves great food in a cozy, intimate but fun environment. Music is a part of setting the mood. Wait staff is attentive and will answer any questions you may have. I highly recommend. It is pricey, but you partly pay for the experience. Great for a romantic dinner or with a large, loud group."
"I've been to Hakkasan twice and the food and service have been consistently exceptional. The waiters and staff are always very professional and super friendly. They make you feel so welcome and will attend to your demands with efficiency and a smile. The second time I went to Hakkasan it was to celebrate my birthday. At the end I was pleasantly surprised to receive a simple but nice birthday card from the Hakkasan team, other than the dessert with a candle. The food is really tasty and for those who are not used to Asian cuisine, there are some quite unique dishes on the menu that are definitely worth a try. The atmosphere is also really nice, the lights are dim and the interior decor is like a modern oriental design. I do recommend making reservations, both times I went I was fortunate enough to have made a reservation and avoided waiting. Hakkasan in Miami is connected to Fontainebleau Miami Beach (hotel)."
"This dinner  started with dumplings and fried soft shell crab, then onto Peking duck cooked to perfection and ending with grouper that was divine.   All four of us 
 Loved the food and the service was excellent.  They need to separate the tables a bit more, but other than that great night."
"Huge hotel but multiple great restaurants. Had amazing meal with Daniel as waiter mid November , excellent custom drinks, great service elegant and cool, lots of delicious food for every palate."
"This is not inexpensive but make the jump and be amazed! Matthew and Ryan (assist.mgr and mgr) go out of there way to make you feel welcome and special. Understand this is the place where the rich,famous and beautiful people go! The tasting menus are the way to go! So much fabulous food. Crispy duck with microgreens, lamb, sea bass, peppered steak.........! You will not leave unsatisfied and the bar is beautiful with a staff knowledgeable in spirits. Just do it!"
Had a dinner at Hakkasan. Food was greatly presented and really tasty - liked especially sorbet as a dessert. Also service was good quality. Only minor was issue that personnel didn't enforce dress code. Their dress code is business casual and people were having dinner in shorts and sleeveless t-shirts.
"This restaurant is always an amazing dining experience with numerous delicious delights to chose from for any culinary palette! We had the Peking Duck this time, among our various choices, and it was just too good to even try to describe! We also met Matthew Moll, the Assistant General Manager, who was both capable and personable. If you get the chance, be sure to dine here!"
"For sure. One of best services we had during our Miami stay. 
In spite of the fact that elevators were broken and we had to walk the fire stair cases, it just made it more valuable to finally get in to this beautiful restaurant!

We are well familiar with the name of Hakkasan and the quality we can expect from their restaurants and sometimes adventurous and exciting kitchen. Therefor our signature evening in Miami was dedicated to this place.

Waiter was extremely helpful, when learning my wife wanted extra hot sauce with her main course, he made a special sauce from his own recipe that was extremely delicious, making my wife very happy.
All brought on time, great knowledge of the winelist and warm service is what we will remember from him but unfortunatly not his name :/

Total recommendation for this place, yes we definetly coming back when in Miami.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"A very busy place indeed, managed to reserve a table. The day we arrived, the lifts had a malfunction, due to a Differently Able person, had to be taken through the back through the service lift. Had a glimpse of the Kitchen, extremely clean and proper and GMP adhered. To compensate, were served free of charge 2 portions of Dim Sum. Vegan Friendly, Food of excellent quality, taste and variety, very good value for money. Mr. Matthew Mello who assisted a fine polite person. The food ordered was double the quantity then that of Mr. Chow and the Bill one third."
"Good food, good and attentive service, beautiful venue.
The dim sum was good but the lamb was just ok.
I recommend it for a different experience"
"We have been to the Miami branch a few times and it continues to provide the “Hakkasan” experience, inspired by it’s big sister in London. Years pass but everything keeps working very well, specially the kind and attentive staff. 

We will just keep coming back. And visiting the big sister in London whenever possible!"
"We were a group of 5 women, 2 of us had dietary restrictions. We let our server know we would be dining family style and asked him to bring what he thought was best for our group. The food was excellent and the service impeccable. I highly recommend this place!"
"I was staying in Miami for business and stayed in the Nobel hotel next door. I decided to  to eat here just before my flight but felt very unwelcome by the staff due to me eating alone. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to receiving great service and care, however due to me belong alone I felt like they didn’t care. Ordered food and drinks but my drink (Diet Coke) didn’t come till halfway through my meal. (30 minutes). Very dismissive and no warmth. Something I enjoy about both restaurants in London."
"As usual Hakkasan delivers with the food, ambiance & polite helpful staff..Highly recommend, sample size dishes."
"We stayed at the Fountainbleau this week and was very excited to try Hakassan as it was highly recommended.  The ambiance was amazing, a really beautiful place.  The problem  we encountered with this restaurant is that we had hoped to make an evening of it.  We had an 8:00 reservation and we were out of there by 8:45.  The food came immediately after ordering.  I felt we were rushed.  At 8:45 pm we had nothing else to do but go to sleep.  Not the way I enjoy my vacations."
"I’ve been there for different occasions and I loved it every single time. The food is amazing, specially the pippa duck is a must try. The service is nothing but the best from severs to bartenders."
"Definitely my favorite restaurant in Miami beach. The atmosphere is amazing and the food is to die for, we ate duck salad, jasmine ribes, black pepper ribs, pippa duck, French beans and egg fried rice. Manon & Mauricio bartenders are the best and our server Adriano was so great and super polite."
Thank you Daniel M. For great service at dim sum on Sunday and dinner on Wednesday. I appreciated your suggestions for what to order and for taking good care of us. The pacing of the meal was perfect. Also thanks for the sneak peak of the new gelato. Food and service were excellent.
"Hakkasan Abu Dhabi is my favourite restaurant in the UAE capital, so obviously a visit in Miami is a must.
Equally great, same interior. It is an excellent restaurant like it’s siblings elsewhere, perhaps the only area where it falls short of Europe and the Middle East is that the service is a tad too casual for my taste."
Incredible Asian Fusion food experience and service. It is well worth the price. Individual orders are served family style. Every dish was incredible.
"After having been to hakkasan in London I always wanted to try the restaurant in Miami and wasn’t disappointed.From the moment we arrived we were politely welcomed and had a drink in the bar.The cocktail maker was lovely and chatty and certainly knows how to make a cocktail! The staff are lovely and friendly.the restaurant is lovely..liked the presentation of food,crockery and lighting.I had the Chilean sea bass and ordered some pack Choi which was just divine.My husband had the beef in merlot wine which was again beautiful.A great restaurant in the Fontainebleau hotel and it’s certainly worth a visit"
Located at the Fontainebleau Resort Hakkasan is an absolute gem. Not your average or regular day to day chinese food but instead a revelation into something completely new. Regular and familiar chinese dishes are crafted with the finest ingredients with a Michelin star twist to create flavours that are out of this world. This is a must do when in Miami... Highly recommend.
"You really want  a fine dining experience. Don't go. 
You really want  an Asian fancy and hip evening, I would go to Zuma or Nobu. 
Hakkasan is not bad, but the food is not a lot better than a middle priced Chinese. Leave out the lovely interior, leave out the loud club music (always wonder what's that good for). And you're stuck with some pretty basic food at premium price: 6 (juicy and large) prawns in a plain curry sauce 38$. Wow. Some shredded beef with a sweet soy sauce: 36$. 
None of the plates had the finesse of other Asian restaurants mentioned. 
Pity. 
Perfect place to see and to be seen though. And post it on your social media page."
"We visited here for drinks prior to going downstairs to the Bleau Bar and then LIV as these are all situated in the Fontaine Bleau. This place is very suave, classy and chic. Would most definitely recommend to all."
"We went on a week night when it wasn’t very busy. Service was fantastic and food  was mind blowing. The dim sum and mango custard are must try’s! It’s definitely pricey, but some of the best Asian fusion you’ll ever have. We got about 6 dishes in total and spent around $200 (no alcohol or beverages). Very nice atmosphere for a date night."
"Every single thing was fantastic - The atmosphere, staff, drinks and especially the food!  Staff recommendations were spot on. Great place to get out of your comfort zone and try new food. Great place for date night or celebrating a special occasion. I make sure I go here every time I am in Miami."
"I attended Hakkasan recently for a birthday dinner, we had multiple people in our group with food allergies from shell fish to veggies and let me tell you our guy Daniel M. was on the ball. specifically broke down all the foods to each individual with food allergies, made sure we know what was in the dishes surrounding the table so those with allergies were aware of the ingredients and their surroundings. Daniel M. you were what we call 5 star employee's in my work place a SAVAGE. Your care and top of the line service is much appreciated"
"Service was very good.  Food was beautifully presented.  Taste combinations were very good.Unfortunately, the menu is very expensive, and everything is ala carte."
Dinner for 2. Nice a'la carte menu with a lot of different dishes. Which makes it a little bit confusing. But the courses we ordered and had were nice and so was the service. But as the hotel - pricy.
"What can I say, I come here quite often and it is always great, love this place and the food is always great, one of my favorite restaurants"
"Excellent time with friends for my first experience there. Daniel M., the server was amazing!!!

Definitely get the mango flan for dessert."
"I went here with my husband on Monday for my birthday meal - we had never been to a Hakkasan before, we were absolutely amazed! The table service was excellent! The waiter helped us out while trying to decide on a wine to get (their wine list is a whole book long, amazing!) 
The food was also amazing! We would highly reccomend to anyone looking to spend a bit more and be looked after while eating dinner!"
"They have a great bar, loved the smoky negroni. The crab & corn soup was amazing as was the almond pear prawns. Other dishes like the stir fried black pepper beef didn't quite deliver for us. The mango custard was really nice. Excellent service. Expensive."
"This was an excellent choice, very refreshing with a good approach to fusion, taste and presentation."
"We recently made our annual trek to Miami Beach to have a Miami Spice (special menu) dinner at Hakkasan. We do this with friends every August/September. This year, as in the past, we were rewarded with a wonderful 3-course meal that left everyone totally sated and raving about their dishes.
This is a great place to visit for Asian cuisine. The restaurant can be a little noisey, but generally is good for dinner with friends.
Of course, people watching at the hotel is a side benefit of a visit to this venue."
"Heard a lot of hype about how good a restaurant it was and from that and the pricepoint had high expectations. However was wary given an other recent experience in a restaurant at same hotel was disappointing.

Hakkasan more than lived up to it's great reputation.

Cocktails, appetizers, wine, entrees and desserts all were excellent and served bby friendly, knowledgeable staff efficiently.

Decor may not have changed much in years, but still works. Warm, cozy, relaxing and appropriate for style of food.

Very good wine list.

Holds los of people, but set-up provides intimacy and is romantic."
"Hakkasan is located inside the Fontainbleau Resort. The design , style atmosphese is the same like all other Hakkasan restaurants in the world.
Food is always good and the service too."
"One of the best restaurants in Miami! the food was delicious. We were there with a baby, but everything was fine, and the staff were very friendly"
"We lingered over a Manhattan, perfectly prepared before dinner- this bar uses Antica vermouth as should be used and the bartender understood that:)
At dinner, Adriano was our server.  we asked for recommendations and he took care to describe each dish and the reason why he recommended tham.  And we liked that they weren't the most expensive - he was not fishing for tips.
I enjoyed an excellent hot & sour soup with a beautiful clean tasting broth mixed with shiitake , chicken & tofu. . The balance was perfect for my taste...it was hot and slightly sour.  Too often it is sweet and vinegar and floury paste.
The first course Dim Sum were delicious. Scallops, duck and sweet potato. Each had its own distinct dumpling dough.
We followed this with Spicy prawn assam with coconut.  Outstanding! Complemented with Stir Fry udon noodle with duck that was againg delicious.
That wa all we needed for two reasonable appetites.
The service was superb.  Adriano check each course to ensure we were happy.
when the bill came he pointed out service was included, not very common in Miami.

A lovely evening and meal."
"We hosted my husbands birthday surprise here, about 25 -30 people and the food & the service was amazing!!  We had a set menu of delicious options  - plenty of variety and everyone is still talking about how great everything was,  I highly recommend."
"Another delightful evening at Hakkasan Miami. Came here several years ago and it’s just as good as it was back then. The waiter was excellent and the food divine. Can never go wrong with this place. Everyone from the children to the adults enjoyed their meal, stand-out food and service."
"Every time I get a chance to go to Hakaksan i get to enjoy this amazing place with amazing food , service and ambiance!!
Try the din sum , try the truffle duck , try the sampei sea bass , try the mango custard ...had a great meal thanks hakkasan team can't wait to go back !!"
"Very nice place, very good food! And with the Miami spice not very expensive! The service was great the ambient very clean and comfortable! I really suggest for a couple date"
"If you are looking for excellent Asian food with unusual flavors and beautiful presentation then this is where you should be going.  Although expensive, the quality of the food and the large portions make this worth a visit for a special evening."
"Nice place to have dinner in Miami! Celebrated my wife’s birthday here... 

I’ve been to HK Las Vegas, which they have a different vibe over there, i think it’s fancier in Vegas :) 

But overall, it’s a nice place :)"
Service was great. Food was great.  We will be back when we visit next.  After being in Miami all weekend and experiencing mediocre food and service around south beach it’s nice to go somewhere that the servers care and food is actually worth the price we are paying.
"Dang Fontainebleau, every dining experience has been better than the next during our stay.  Hakkasan has the most delicious food and signature cocktails.  The room decor is fun and inviting.  The vibe and energy fit the room perfectly.  We ate at the bar and were treated so well Manoa ( female bartender) and Mauricio.  I was blown away by how hard working all of the staff are, management included.  Francois is the GM and he is definitely the presence and backbone of the room.  Thank you all for a memorable night!!"
"This Chinese is great. Everything we tried was tasty. The service and all- no complaints. The only thing that would make it better, if they had a terrace. Otherwise it is a fantastic Chinese restaurant with great service and food. We had a dinner with my friend in midweek. The place looked empty at first, it turned out that we were there early, most people showed up later and at around 9-10 the restaurant was full. 
The menu is quite standard Chinese. The hot and sour soup was very tasty. The spring rolls, the szechuan chicken were good as well. Peking duck was great. 
The wine list is very good. They have two in fact. The restaurant's wine list and if more choice is needed, a waiter can bring out the hotel's more extensive wine list that has a greater selection of rare wines. Italy and especially France is well represented.  Champagne too."
"My dining in Hakkasan at the Fontainebleau Hotel was a wonderful experience. It's a beautiful restaurant with a warm ambiance. The food was excellent and the cocktails were magical. A huge shout out to our Server, Charly Naranjo who was extremely attentive, personable and knowledgeable about the menu. He offers great recommendations with incredible dessert pairings. The Manager came over a few times to ensure satisfaction. We were ""WOW"" by the food and great service. Thank you all for a wonderful dinner experience. We will definitely return!"
"The resultant is located in the Fontainebleau Miami beach hotel. The food they serve is magic, I would definitely pay a visit the next time I am in MIA."
"Loved the food and ambiance here.bif you're a Hakkasan or fusion foodie ,you will love it too. It's located in the Fontainebleau hotel so convenient too if you're staying there or going to the hotel club for a night out."
"This is a great place, the ambiance is amazing!! The food was spectacular, every dish was perfect, service was above average as well. Nothing to complain about this place!!!"
"I came for the first time to this place with a bunch of friends. We had an amazing time! Great food, great presentation, great vibes and to top it off, we received the perfect service from Adriano. He was so professional and natural! Explained us the menu and offered us so many options for dessert since I always try desserts wherever I travel to. I definitely recommend this place, it reminds me of the true European hospitality! Well done! ❤️"
This restaurant stays as steady as a rock. Been there 8 times in 12 years time. I suspect that the same staff is still there after all these years. Again super duper. Unbelievable quality.
"A family group dined at Hakkasan without prior booking
Though the service was efficient, we were let down by the quality of the food
My lobster(presentation and taste) was not top notch
I have had lobster dinner at nearby greek restaurant which was top class, and went back there within the week
My dessert-macaroons, was not what I expected. It was dry and bland. Pity!
it was also expensive
The décor was too dark too
The group members were all let down and this was the worst dinner over our 2 weeks holidays in Boston and Miami"
"We went as a family of 4 on the 8th August 2018.
Would highly recommend this restaurant for not only its fabulous creative food but also the exceptional service provided.
We have two people in our family that have a nut allergy and also my wife is vegetarian.
Our waiter not only looked after all of us ,  but also recommended some excellent food.
Overall great food , great service , great ambiance ... highly recommended."
We had a super evening here. Our waiter and assistant were really attentive without being intrusive and were very knowledgeable giving us good menu suggestions. The meal was excellent and so tasty. The dim sum and duck salad were amazing. We have been to the New York restaurant and loved this one as much. I would highly recommend.
"Atmosphere: divine. Feels like you are eating Chinese in a movie set. Server: Adriano. Also divine. Warm, attentive, kind and did a lovely job with my four boys. Over the top. Rest of staff - also divine. Welcoming. Food: you will learn from it and be inspired. Perfect."
This location at FontaineBleau is just as wonderful as the one in NYC! All traditionally decorated the same with the dark wood and dim lighting...sexy and sensual with a killer menu! The food is nothing short of delicious!!!!
"With a group of colleagues I had dinner at the restaurant. The service was good and the waiter recommended us to not order too much - which turned out to be a good advise, as we would otherwise had wasted food we couldn’t eat. Wine was expensive. Atmosphere nice. I was disappointed to sit indoor while being next to the ocean. There was a terrace but without furniture and the interior decor didn’t allow for a view."
"What an great place, the food is ridiculously amazing, the staff is wonderful. The waiter Marcos was amazing and truly went above and beyond recommending dishes and being so attentive. He was simply the best!!! Matthew and Hector were also great- Thank you all for an amazing time. Can't wait to come back with the family!"
"I have NEVER gone wrong with eating at any of the Hakkasan restaurants.  Great ambiance, amazing service, and excellent food.  I would highly recommend the place looking for a great meal and a good time.  Expensive but worth every penny."
Everything on the menu is simply amazing!!!!!Charsui and steamed basked were over tje top along with tje duck dumplings.  The staff is very attentive as well.
"if you want loud, cheesy and commercial with a rap video thrown in- this is your spot.   Food pretty good, but the atmosphere is clubby."
"My husband and I were able to turn a disappointing night into a lovely time thanks to Hakkasan. Our first restaurant choice was a bust. We stopped by Hakkasan with no reservation. They were able to accommodate us and treated us to a wonderful meal. Our first visit here was in 2014, and it has only gotten better! Johnny and Adriano helped us with menu suggestions and took great care of us. Even the manager stopped by during a busy evening and made sure we were well cared for. Try the dumplings with all the dipping sauces. Taro fried rice is a also a winner. After a beautiful chocolate dessert, we were directed to the deck for a great view. What a great way to cap off our night!"
Hakkasan is Hakkasan... and its for sure one of the best modern chinese cusine on miami beach......and with Ardiano's superb and explanatory service....its a wonderful experience.
"The decor and ambience is defiantly Hakkasan , the food ingredients were fresh and good , the presentation on the dot but there was something missing . The Hakkasan touch to the food , its seemed good . ok but not wow . It didnt have the zinginest of Hakkasan London .
The wire selection was good and relatively speaking , priced well .but overall it seemed pricy"
"I don't know how I can give Hakkasan, and Steven, our server, an appropriate enough review.

I had come to Hakkasan on a business trip while in Miami, and adored it - so much so, that when my husband and I booked a trip for his birthday, I told him we needed to hit Hakkasan, and that he'd be blown away from the cuisine that was the best Cantonese food I'd had since I was in China years before.

We arrived early for our reservation, and took a seat at the gorgeous bar, starting with cocktails. I ordered a tequila and yellow pepper cocktail, while my husband settled in with the Western Smash (rye whiskey, blackberry, lemon, and mint). 

We then were seated relatively quickly, and introduced to our server for the evening, Steven. I could (and will) write an entire paragraph praising Steven, but will focus on the food for the time being.

We began with the vegetarian Dim Sum platter ($26), which included two orders each of the cabbage dumpling, mushroom dumpling, black rice and veggie dumpling, and bean curd roll, and also ordered the pan fried veggie dumpling ($12), which was one of my favorite parts of the evening. These appetizers were the perfect size, and could easily be split with three people, though it was easier not to fight over dim sum as we each had one of the offerings. All were fresh, light, and perfectly prepared. 

For entrees, I asked Steven what he recommended, and he mentioned that the snapper ($34) was caught on one of Hakkasan's boats from a fisherman, which sealed the deal for me (it comes in a filet, not a fish with eyeballs, which for me, was an added plus). My husband went with the orange chicken ($22) and the crispy shredded beef with pancakes ($38), because go big or go home, right? 

I cannot speak enough about the quality of the food. If you have bad Asian food, especially Chinese food, you feel bloated and disgusting almost instantaneously upon consumption. The two of us finished our meals (him with two entrees) as well as cocktails and the aforementioned appetizers, and felt GOOD - full, but good. The price reflects the quality of the ingredients to the highest degree - all was absolute perfection. My husband said the orange chicken was the best he's had in his entire life - he is STILL, weeks later, telling people about how good it was, and how fresh it tasted. 

Steven provided us with one of the best dining experiences I've had in my entire life. He was professional to a T, but also warm and friendly, offering suggestions, but never explicitly trying to offer items strictly to drive the price up, but to increase our dining experience. His personality was so appreciated, and my husband and I considered ourselves lucky to be at one of his tables that evening - I will tell friends, colleagues, and family in the future to try to book a table in Steven's section; it took a wonderful dining experience up so many notches that I don't even have words to express my gratitude (but seriously - if you can book in his section via an OpenTable note, please try - I promise, you will not be disappointed).

Steven was truly a consummate professional, but was not stuffy - I will send good vibes that he stays at Hakkasan so that I can request seatings in his area for future trips to the South Beach area. I cannot thank him enough for making my husband's birthday, and first trip to Miami, so spectacular.

Hakkasan is a true gem - the food is phenomenal, the drinks beautifully prepared and fresh/delicious, the wine list robust, and service spectacular. We are true fans and will be back many times in the future! 

Thank you again to Steven and Hakkasan for a wonderful dining experience."
"Beautiful food, fabulous service, quality evening.
Even though the prices are very very expensive if your looking for something special then this is the place for you. 
The service was amazing and cocktails super yummy!!"
"Hakkasan is definitely our favorite. My husband and I used to travel from NY often and we would only stay at the Fontainebleau and Ofcourse Dine at the finest Hakkasan. We then moved to Miami and we still Dine at Hakkasan atleast once a week, only if we get our waiter Steve. We have many food restrictions and he is super helpful and knowledgeable and will advise us with the best suggestions catering to our wants and needs. Hakkasan is definitely a hidden gem In Miami but worth every bite and ALWAYS the best food and time. Absolutely HIGHLY suggested, just make sure you get Steve 

Yours Truly,"
My wife and I had a delicious dinner with great service last night at Hakkasan. The Dim Sum Sampler had four pairs of creative and flavorful potstickers. My Foie Gras Fried Dumplings were a marvelous choice. My Chicken Claypot was excellent. My wife’s Chicken with Tangerine Sauce rounded out a fabulous meal.
"Every year, my wife and I make it to Miami Beach, and one of our stops is Hakkasan.  The restaurant itself is beautifully appointed; you feel like you're in Hong Kong.   Lots of dark wood, contrasted by bursts of red - make for an intimate and relaxing setting.

Service is impeccable.   The menu has many, many options - from classic Peking Duck to a modern take on some classics like lobster potstickers.

On this visit, we shared the veggie potstickers (as they were out of the lobster) and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty they were.  We then shared the crispy lemon chicken, which was unctuous - perfect balance of sweet and acid along with the jasmine rice.  We shared the chocolate dessert.

I only wish we had more room!"
"Hakkasan was the best restaurant at the Fontainebleau Hotel...and that's quite a compliment. Our cocktails were delicious...the Chinese Mule was especially yummy. Next came our deep fried crispy prawns in orange sauce, good but the least interesting of the dishes we tried. Much better were the large, perfectly cooked stir-fry scallops with fresh sugar snap peas and crunchy macadamia nuts. And the stir-fry udon noodles served with exquisitely prepared duck. Also, the stir-fry eggplant in king soya sauce...luscious. For dessert, we shared a refreshing black current and mandarin sorbet.  All in all, a fantastic meal in a romantic, cozy venue. We'll be back!"
"Have been to Hakkasan London many times and so had high expectations for the Miami restraunt. 

Chicken starter was bland but the Vegetable Dim Sum was tastey. The 5 vegetable main was again boring and bland but the egg fried rice was delicious. We asked for chilly sauce which took 10 minutes to arrive even though the restraunt was not busy as we had a late sitting. 

Most disappointing of all was the dessert saga. It took ages to arrive, we tried to be patient but gave up and requested to cancel. On cancelling the waiter said “it’ll only be a minute now- it was given to the next table”. Not acceptable service - mistakes happen but not on a quiet late sitting. 

The waiter paid more attention to the table sat next to us than anyone else- they appeared to be his pals. Overall disappointing experience - this branch is over rated with bad service just riding on the reputation hype and the success of Hakkasan London. Avoid and spend your money elsewhere if you are expecting a fine dining experience here - food is not great and service is worse."
"Visited while resident at the Fontainebleau Hotel.

Crispy duck salad a highlight. The dim sum also.
Try the mango custard dessert as well.

Great service as one would expect"
Food was amazing we ordered the vegetarian chicken which was unbelievable my wife had to ask the waiter if the dish was vegetarian. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend anyone visiting Miami to give this place a try.
"Good food, fun decor and very buzzy. Nice wine list. In the middle of everything at The Fontainebleau!"
Well I am impressed with Charlie my server.... Everything was wonderful... Frankly I also think the price point on the experience itself was well worth it...The pictures speak for themselves saying so look good...I've got 2 go back.
"I can't say enough great things about this place! The food, atmosphere, service: all amazing! The managers Matt and Francois were super welcoming and stopped by to check up on us and really showed how much they cared about our experience going well. Our server was quick, attentive, nice, and welcoming. All recommendations were spot on but the crispy duck salad is TO DIE FOR."
"I am familiar with the Hakkasan in London, so decided to try this one on a Saturday night while in Miami. 

We really enjoyed it and Bon (the waitress served us) made it a very enjoyable experience. Based on Bon's recommendation we made a selection of dishes. All of the dishes were excellent, particularly the pipa duck and the diced chicken with hot chilly... The duck was delicious with crispy skin and lean & tender meat, it was our favorite! We are very familiar with Asian food and the dishes here are definitely very authentic! Thank you Bon!

The only negative feedback is for the reservation hostess. As it was Cinco de Mayo and the traffic was heavy. We called 45 minutes prior to the reservation to inform that we might be a bit late, the hostess told us that they could only hold the table for extra 15 minutes... When we got there the restaurant was very empty. When we left 1.5 hours later there were still many tables available... So we were a bit disappointed about the unnecessary rush."
"We live in Miami and had never been to Hakkasan. We decided to go for our son’s college graduation dinner. 

The ambiance is warm and welcoming. The bar is beautiful and drinks are great 👍 

Thanks to Antione for great suggestions and service. He was delightful. 

Food was delicious. And the venue is inside the Fountainbleau hotel. Worth a visit!"
"Five stars. Tried the vegan dumplings, orange chicken, black bean snapper, four vegetables,  rice and mango custard and semi fredo dessert. Everything was outstanding. Desserts were above and beyond. Cocktails (fresco) were some of the best we have ever had. Pace of service and presence of wait staff was perfect. Will definitely go back when in Miami. Very worth the price. Great decor and ambiance."
"Had a wonderful dining experience with my family. Service was outstanding food was amazing! Steamed dumplings, peppered beef, French beans and egg fried rice were all delicious. We will definitely return soon!"
Ate one night at Hakkasan at Fontaineblei which was fine but did not knock my socks off like the one in Vegas. Service was a tab bit slow....
Had a wonderful birthday dinner here with friends. The food was spot on and the service was impeccable.
"Knowing the Hakassan group and restaurants from various destinations I picked the place for our family easter dinner.
Well the time in Miami either never was or is over - this place in a crazy big hotel - feels like a touch of Las Vegas - topped of with Hollywood taken over by ugly bad mannered Russians - at least the night we were there. Food was OK - but for my Hakassan was always ASIAN food heaven - not this time - may be I should have sticked to the cocktails - they are nice and as expensive as a good dish."
"We went to Hakkasan twice while we were in Miami, what an experience,from the Hostesses to the Bar service, these guys are great, were we had Lychee Martinis 🍸🍸 yum yum, then to our table, our server was Steven who was the best and his assistant Stafford both could not do enough for us. We had two wonderful evenings, the food was to dye for. We had the signature Dim Sum which is delicious, we had preordered the Peking Duck which I’m still raving about, this is the best l have ever tasted. Not to mention the wine 🍷, l can’t wait to return but will have to wait awhile. Tks to each and everyone who took care of us, we had the best time ever."
"Had dinner the other night and had Steven Mc Grath as our waiter and let me tell you he made the whole experience amazing and special. What an asset !  very respectful and professional, which is hard to find in Miami these days"
"I had not been to the restaurant in a while and had to choose a place to celebrate a birthday.  I recalled having a great experience in the past and decided to try it again.  Prior to dinner, we sat at the dramatic bar for some great specialty cocktails.  Later, Steven was our server and was very knowledgeable and attentive.  His food recommendations were incredible!  By far the best service, meal and ambience I've had in Miami Beach.  Thank you Hakkasan... great job!!!"
"We had the best dim sums of our lives.
Fantastic restaurant. Not as refrigerated as some of the other restaurants at the Fontainebleau. Good service. Beautiful bar!"
"On our first night of our Honeymoon,we headed to this restaurant based on online reviews. The host could not have been more unhelpful/rude when trying to get a table. Our first impression of Miami was not a very good one! Cecconi's next door was thankfully a much nicer experience."
"Experience at Fontainbleau wasn't as expected; but Hakkasan definitely made up for it. Food, service, ambiance, all above par!"
"Dark, seductive, atmospheric – our first impressions of Hakkasan Miami.

We started with an assortment of four different dim sum, which were delectable. Main was noodles and two scallop dishes; one with macadamia nuts. We had one chocolate fondant and one fruit dessert. All food was well presented, and faultless."
"the food is a huge disappointment, unlike the menu and food at Hakkasan original in London.  The dishes had more chili peppers in them than the chicken and shrimp.  The dumpling dough was very thick and gluey"
"The restaurant is a little dark and claustrophobic. There are no windows, and there are dark ornately carved screens everywhere. The tables and booths were too close together. I had the crab and sweet corn soup, which was okay but basically boring. I then had the foie gras dumplings with a tasty black vinegar dipping sauce, although rather than foie gras, the filling was more like minced pork, and my husband had an innocuous crispy lemon chicken dish. I then had the stir-fry udon noodles with duck. The noodles were excellent, but the duck consisted of thinly-pounded over-cooked leathery strips. We finally tried the rice pudding, which was listed as having pineapple and macadamia nut components in a cardamom cream,  but it was a tasteless, gluey concoction with no discernible evidence of pineapple or macadamia nuts. It was inedible, so we gave up."
"We had read so many rave reviews that we were really looking forward to some excellent food. The items read well on the menu, but in reality, the food was okay...not special. Rice dishes are large enough to serve 3 to 4 people. Probably the best item we had was the Honey glazed Sea Bass. The stir fried snapper and the honey chicken weren’t very good.

With one drink per person, an appetizer and entree, dinner was $100 per person. We were disappointed and expected more for what we paid.This is an expensive restaurant for okay food.  We would not recommend this."
"We booked a table for 2 for my birthday dinner expecting to be impressed and stay for a while to enjoy the chef's specials (complete with a bottle of champagne).  The noise level in the restaurant, while different, wasn't very romantic  -unless you think tribal drumming on a loop tape is romantic.  
And while we were told that the dress code was business casual/nice dress, there were lots of people in jeans, short, t shirts and flip flops.
All that aside, the food was Chinese Mall take out quality and we left vowing to never go back or recommend it."
Staff very helpful. Food preparation best. It is probably best Chinese restaurant in Miami. Best wine selection
Small plates good for sharing if your party is into that. Very tasty and atmosphere was a bit loud with background music but just right. Cool theme and worth the meal.
"Had a lovely meal here, the food was stunningly good and took Chinese food to another level.  

The wine list is extensive (and expensive..!) but delicious. 

Unfortunately the service was very average  but that sums up the entire trip to Miami. Automatically added service charges seem to have stopped people trying to make you feel special and give you an experience.  

Still one of the best meals I had in Miami."
"Had a great night , great food and Champagne, good staff from the barmen to the waiter who was good at guiding us through the menu , really enjoyed our night , well worth a visit, my only grumble is that because of the layout you do feel as if you eat in little groups so don't get the full ambience of the place, but still a great night and thats me being picky"
"There is a reason people keep going back to this gem nestled on top of the Fontainebleau.... amazing dishes and impeccable service. 
Dim sum was out of this world and I can honestly say that the fried rice was the best I ever had!! Scallops were delicious and my husband and kids were raving ( and fighting over:) the pork dish. Everything down to the dessert ( rice pudding and tea) was outstanding. And our waiter ( I wish I remembered his name-want to say Ken) was so incredible-I even tipped above the service charge ( something I rarely do but he deserved it!!)
I highly recommend Hakkasan -even my 13 year old said this was one of the best restaurants ever (& we eat out a lot:) Kudos  to the Hakkasan team!!"
"We have arrived in Miami and after a long flight and a few drinks by the beach, it was time for dinner. For dinner, our choice was Hakkasan. To be honest, I've been to Hakkasan in the UK, but it was nothing like what I experienced in Miami, the food is full of flavour, I just cannot explain the taste. The whole ambience of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful and has a floral scent as soon as you walk in. For starters, we had crispy prawn with mango, which left a fruity juicy taste in my mouth, with a crispy finish.These prawns were more savoury and a had a satay finish, I was not really a fan of these because I prefer more sweet or sour taste. 

And my favourite dish of the night had to be the dim sum platter- 8 little pockets of flavour;
 
2x Scallop Shumai
2x Har Gar
2x Black crystal rice vegetables
2x Crab meat.
 
Equally, all the dim sum pieces were nice but my favourite had to be the dim sum topped with caviar style beads. 

For my main, it was between the Bahamian lobster or the black pepper tenderloin but eventually gave in and went for the beef, choosing egg fried rice to accompany the beef. I had my beef cooked medium to rare as I like my meat a bit tender and juicy, the beef was very spicy but that is just how I like it! Everything was washed down with several glasses of house red wine, which really hit the spot! 
 
One thing I always appreciate bout Americans is the customer service and we really gave the best of the best in terms of customer service and would definitely recommend going to Hakkasan for dinner. The lightening is dimmed and is a perfect place to go for a date.
 
 
Price: £££"
"Hakkasan was truly a fantastic experience. The crispy duck salad , whole duck and orange chicken were my favorite. However our stay in Fontainebleau hotel was very disappointing. There are much nicer hotels out there. But the Hakkasan was great !!!"
"Warm welcome, full attention, excellent food quality, speed of service. This is 5 start restaurant from start to end."
the food at Hakkasan is consistent.  I have eaten at 4 of them around the world and they are excellent.  I love the dim sum and dumplings.  The staff were very helpful.  the price was consistent with other Hakkasan.
"Beautifully decorated. Service was impeccable. Got the dim sum and 3 of the 4 options were very good, one was not good. Had the truffle rice dish which was excellent. Overpriced as expected, but a nice experience."
"Ok so if you are going to South Beach , you may not even think of this classics restaurant but try it 

In the Fontainebleau , which is worth a visit in its own right , the restaurant is the same as in London but is superb 

Cool , great ambiance , but most of all superb tasty food 

I love it and I always come back once i am in Miami 

Definitely one of my favourites"
"One of the only Hakkasan restaurant were I found the food average. Having dined at most of the hakkasans worldwide, found this one disappointing. The Dimsum was very average. Although I must recommend the Pipa duck here."
"Atmosphere: Very cool, dimly lit restaurant with a modern-industrial feel. Clean, well maintained & designed. 

Service: Pretty good. Attentive, informative & professional staff. However, both server and manager were quite defensive when we expressed our dissatisfaction with the food & offered unsatisfactory resolutions (free dessert... we didn't want dessert; a replacement meal ""of equal price""..)

Food: Overpriced and as my friend described her dish... ""disgusting"". The meat was of very poor quality (rubbery) and there were excessive amounts of fish and oyster sauce in almost every dish we ordered.

Bar: Unique cocktail menu - Asian inspired. 'The Hakka' was very good (Grey Goose vodka, TY-KU sake, coconut passion fruit and lychee juice)."
"Wonderful atmosphere, great music and staff. Dumpling soup are a must!!!! Excellent restaurant to visit!"
This is hands down my wife’s favourite restaurant in Miami. The food and service are top notch. I’m personally Vegan and they are very accommodating. Brian G. the head sommelier is one of the very best and always remembers us.  I must also give a shout out to Alison who is also a Sommelier there and provides wonderful service. This restaurant is all over the planet but I’ve been to few and nothing comes close to this one in Miami.
"This restaurant is the best one in Miami Beach. 
We enjoy going there every time when we come to Miami. 
Dim Sum are very good and the duck is one of the speciality. 
Go and discover this amazing restaurant. 
Inside, the design is beautiful and the atmosphere very nice. 
I will come back for sure ! 
LM"
"We had a great evening. 
The decor is stunning. Very large restaurant but divided in smaller rooms to make it more cosy. 
The waitress was very friendly and helpful. 
The food was great:  we loved the crispy duck salad and charred seabass. The chicken was a little to sweet to our taste. Pipa duck and almond pear prawns were great too. 
Not cheap ;-)"
"Good food. Do get the Sea bass, as it's excellent. We did a tasting menu, which while very nice was ridiculously over priced. Being in the Fontainebleau is one of the reasons. A captive highend clientele."
"Place is gorgeous, they have renovated Fontainebleau to the nines and it doesn’t disappoint-the bar is stunning worth having a drink there. The food was outstanding and all of waitress recommendations were superb-the vegetarian chicken is not to be missed-truly incredible! And Hakkan noodles also a must. Really can’t imagine anything on the menu not be great, a must if u stay here or close by ."
"We had a chance to snag a table on Sunday night before going to LIV nightclub.  We were interested in trying the restaurant having heard rave reviews.  We were not disappointed in the least.  The staff was excellent and very mindful of our questions around the menu.  The dishes were perfectly prepared and truly delicious.  We had the foie gras dumplings that were so good we ordered a second round.  The prawns were very good as well.  We also had the spicy snapper and the house fried rice which was delicious.  

The decor was very modern with (obviously) an Asian feel to it.  The lighting added to the overall ambiance which all contributed to it feeling intimate but not isolating.

All in all, a great experience and one that will be unquestionably worth repeating."
"Absolutely loved the layout and interior of this place. very cool, food was very nice, though 2 of my friends had the same chicken dish and spent the early hours of the morning throwing up- that being said my meal was delicious and the sorbet for dessert was lovely too.

Such a cool place. Would go again though not sure my friends would.."
"miami, a must, not just about the restaurant, but the atmosphere, the hotel, great. i booked before i got there, christmas twice.

i love that, and when ever , where ever i travel to, i have to find one, i was looking for somewhere like busaba and found out some history and the ties they both have.

food s a bit pricey but it is worth it.

book a table and go"
"Recently stayed at the Fountainbleau Hotel Miami and had the great pleasure of eating in houise at Hakkasan. Being from Australia we have never heard of the restaurant but also being from Australia we have some outstanding chinese / asian restuarants in our city. 

Apart from the decor for a quite large restaurant it felt very private and very quiet as well as authentic. The staff were very attentive and no request was an issue.

The dim sum was outstanding as was the Sea Bass. One of my favourite fish whilst travelling overseas as it is very rare to find on Australian restaurant menus. 

I will no doubt visit the oth Hakkasan restaurants now on my travels.

Outstanding. Priced to match but well worth it."
"Hakkasan, Miami, is most certainly a wonderful choice, similar to the one in NYC. Reasonable cost, two people around USD 220, regular wine included, and desert as well."
"We found exactly what we wanted to eat on arrival in Miami Beach - ribs and dimsum.  Hakkasan was great to get us seated at the bar and served up our food with some great sake.  No hanging about, unless you want to...."
"I just ate with my family at Hakkasan and I was disappointed. It is an Asian fusion restaurant, but does not come close to other Asian fusion places like Tao. It is tapas style and the portions are relatively small. The prices are absolutely ridiculous!! And to be honest, the flavor was lacking in every dish that we ordered. The service was very good and our waiter was very attentive. As a foodie, I don't mind paying a high price for excellent food, but here we paid a ridiculous amount of money for very average food. Buyer beware!"
"Incredible is the outcome. The Dubai outpost was good but sweet. The Miami outpost hit the spot. Probably the best Chinese I’ve been to in recent times and comparable to Melbourne’s Silks, which is widely regarded given Melbourne’s homage to Chinese food and history of Chinese people. Try the ribs try the Singapore noodles in fact try it all! And don’t forgot the Miso semifreddo. All good in this hood."
If you like authentic Dim Sum this is the most fun place to get it but before have a stop over in the bars as the cocktails are great.  Went with my wife and another couple and reallly enjoyed it.
This is a quality Asian restaurant. All food no matter your preference is quality; led by a fine Chef called Kenny. Nothing is too much trouble for Kenny nor indeed the talented servers & managers. The decor is inspiring and tasteful. You could be back in time in the Orient. A gastronomic and not to be missed experience.
"A beautiful lunch in a lovely restaurant . The dim sum is the thing to have , beautifully presented, and unique. Excellent quality , we ordered two mains and they were good but the dim sum is the winner . Start down at the pool and have a great cocktail , then head to the restaurant . Can’t wait to go back."
"My family and I were in Miami for a conference that my husband was attending and we decided to stay the weekend. We went to Hakkasan Miami because we were told that it was the best place to get Chinese. Our super late reservation was for 10pm because this was the only available time. As soon as we got to the restaurant we were greeted by a very nice hostess who walked us to our table. The decor was nice but a tad bit dark. All the dishes came out delicious. The foie gras dumplings were a tad bit under cooked and had a rubbery texture. One of the managers Matthew came to our table and was nice and gave us his business card. As we were walking out after a lovely evening, the same manager Matthew walked us out. My husband decided to step to the restroom before leaving and he was walking behind this manager who kept staring at my 13 year old daughter very inappropriately. My husband became very upset so we left the restaurant promptly. We decided to walked around the Fontainebleau property which was beautiful. After we finally got our rental car from valet and were at the traffic light the same manager Matthew was in a vehicle next to us with his windows cracked open and smoking what smelled like marijuana, there was so much smoke coming from the car that I think all of valet could smell it. My husband was so upset from the evening that he was going to report this manager to corporate but he had thought that he lost his business card. We had completely forgot about this incident but found the young mans business card in my husbands coat pocket. I strongly suggest the Fontainebleau look into the individuals they hire because they leave a really bad impression to returning guest."
"Hakkasan is expensive especially if you are accustomed to local Chinatown restaurant prices.  After having eaten at Hakkasan Shanghai which is an absolutely gorgeous restaurant I had to try the one in Miami.  I made a point of booking the weekend dim sum brunch which at $45 per person is considered a good value here.  The steamed dumplings were delectable - my husband enjoyed the fried dim sum and the spareribs.
We chose the char sui pork over the lemon chicken and the mango custard.  Overall everything was tasty and perfectly prepared.  It was a lot of food!  I loved the sui mai with the truffle and the steamed scallop dumpling.  And last but not least the service was stellar - Bonne the hostess was charming and personable.  She recommended some must try dishes and we came back for dinner!   

Yes - get the duck salad - it is as delicious as other reviewers say.

(Yes I’ve had absolutely heavenly dim sum in Hong Kong and San Francisco and Hakkasan isn’t at that level but the whole experience here was wonderful)"
Very good service and very good food.  Just listen to the waitresses and what you should order.  We were not dissapointed. Excellent experience
"Located at the iconic Fountainbleu Hotel on Miami Beach, Hakkasan is a world-class Chinese restaurant (Literally! -- New York, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Mumbai, London, Dubai, San Francisco, etc.) -- Miami/Miami Beach is an area rich with numerous truly outstanding restaurants -- I'd have to think long & hard to try to think of any that are better than Hakkasan.  yes, it's that incredible!
The decor is gorgeous, and the seating spacious, comfortable and the alcoves have a good sense of privacy.  Service is spot-on excellent (Note: $30 Fountainbleau parking is ""validated"" @ Hakkasan to a reduced flat rate of $15 -- we've been to this hotel many, many times & on this visit restaurant guest parking ""car pick-up"" had been moved to a Northern end of the Fountainbleau which made for GREATLY IMPROVED efficiency of car pick-up after dinner -- Thank you Fountainbleau!).
As for the food, as best that i try to show restraint, almost every single dish merits a
MUST TRY rating (It's true!!).  We enjoyed:
Hakka cocktails - vodka, sake, lychee -- MUST TRY!! (Careful, it's addictively easy to drink & has A LOT of alcohol !!)
Jasmine smoked tea ribs - succulent, fall-off-the-bone ribs -- MUST TRY!!
Crystal Lobster Dumplings - Succulent &  DELICIOUS (as is ALL of the Hakkasan dim dum)
Vegetable Dumplings - pan-seared with a savory vegetable filling -- you'll NEVER have better dumplings (that can be so ordinary ""elsewhere"")
Peking Duck - we had a party of 7 that allowed sharing of this delicacy -- again, you'll be hard-put to ever find a better Peking duck than Hakkasans'!!
Hakka mushroom noodles - MUST TRY!! Truly!!
Honey Grilled Seabass -- MUST TRY!! DELICIOUS!! Absolutely succulent!!
Black Pepper Beef - MUST TRY!!  Perfectly seared cubes of filet mignon, in an incredibly delicious rich, savory, peppered sauce -- you'll NEVER find a better version of this dish!!
Stir-fry prawns & zuccini in XO sauce - savory & delicious 
Stir-fry eggplant in King soya sauce - delicious side-dish!!
Stir-fried green beans with green olive paste -- MUST TRY!!
Mango custard & coconut sorbet dessert w/ pink grapefruit accents - a yummy finish to an INCREDIBLE meal !!
In summary, yes, Hakkasan has AMAZING Chinese food, and lives-up to all of the hype.
If you've never been,or if you're visiting South Florida and are seeking an absolutely incredible dinner experience, you owe it to yourself to visit the Fountainbleau Hotel's Hakkasan restaurant on Miami Beach!!"
"I don’t know where to start:
The place it’s spectacular, is a Cantonese style place, and the decor it’s just on point. It does look like a fancy expensive restaurant, but to be honest it’s not over the top expensive.
The service was prompt and courteous, but the food was to another level, we had dumplings and dim sum for appetizer and it was a bomb, and we also shared a fried rice and some beef in oyster sauce that we felt in love with... We really enjoyed our dinner here."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here! We had dumplings, pork ribs, a chicken dish, a beef dish and a noodle. Amazing!!! Loved everything. The drinks were perfect! The service was amazing without being intrusive. The ambiance was lovely. We hope to return!"
"The best restaurant experience we've ever had. The food was amazing, the drinks were one of a kind, the service was outstanding. Matthew was the manager that night and he made sure we had an unforgettable night. 

My husband and I were visiting friends in Miami and they took us here. I didn't know what to expect at first, but after few of our friends said that Hakkasan is their favorite restaurant in Miami, my expectations were high. Well, Hakkasan successfully exceeded my high expectations.

We let Matthew make the food choices for us, and we couldn't believe how delicious everything tasted. I can't really decide what was the best, but I definitely what to recommend the Crispy Duck Salad and the Peking Duck...

I can go on and on about our experience at Hakkasan, but we are back in Texas now and sad we don't have a Hakkasan here. Can't wait to go back again. 

Thank you Hakkasan and thank you Matthew for making our night unforgettable and giving us one more reason to love Miami."
"Specialities (dim sum platter and crispy duck salad) are must, as well as French beans (the best ever) and stir-fry eggplant. Veggies be careful as the vegetarian part of the menu includes non-vegetarian items. Anyways excellent service, asian-like modern interier, nice music and the atmosphere. Everyone will be amazed by the place and enjoy the meal irrespectively of whether you generally like or not asian cuisine."
My time at Hakkasan is uplifting and satisfying! From the time u get off the elevator and sip on your first drink you know why you've returned! The music by Dj Jean and the management( Matt)and staff meeting your every need even anticipating before is truly amazing. I can't tell enough of my friends about this great place! I live in Philly with the best restaurants in the world and Hakkasan is right up there with the best!
Once we figured out the menu and how to order we had a wonderful meal. If you get a chance you really should give this place a try.
"Wow - this place was fantastic.   It was my birthday and I was visiting my cousins in Miami Beach, and I LOVE Asian food, so selected this restaurant from TA.   I am so glad I did - the food was delicious, and our waiter was extremely helpful in assisting us with our food selections.  We had the Ribs and Peking Dumplings for appetizers, and Scallops with Edamame, Szechuan Chicken, and the Lemon Chicken for entrees.   Our waiter suggested all but the lemon chicken (which was the only dish I didn't care for).   I also got a birthday surprise - a candle in my dessert and happy birthday sung to me by the staff!   Also the General Manager (?) came by to see how our dinner was - which was a nice touch.   The atmosphere here is also really cool.  Great dinner and service - I highly recommend this restaurant!"
"Went to celebrate my birthday.  It was an excellent experience.  Food and service were awesome.  Very elegant and cozy place to celebrate.  The dim sum and duck were supreme.  If you are into Chinese food, you will enjoy the meal."
"All my visits to Hakkasan have been amazing. Food is served in perfect portions (not too large, not too small). The menu is varied, and very well explained by the servers, focusing mainly on Hong-Kong cuisine.  I have tried different plates on every visit and I have yet to find something that is not truly delicious.  The service is fast, detailed, the servers are knowledgeable, attentive, and excellent in customer service. 

On my last visit, there was a minor problem with the glass of our soda, that had broken at its opening. We were not charged for our sodas and we were treated to free desert (by the way, delicious).

The atmosphere is lounge-style. This place can be romantic while at the same time inviting for large groups with excellent meal sharing menu or even business conversations in its Asia-inspired design.

Simply fantastic."
"Everything about hakkasan was amazing. Excellent service, decor, food, and drinks. Portion sizes were impressive, and was very reasonably priced for a nice place at the Fontainebleau"
This is perhaps the finest Asian restaurant we have ever dined at. Well prepared using the finest ingredients. Beautiful surroundings. Professionally plated and served.
"i came here for my daughters birthday and under the miami spice menu for lunch time, the food was beautifully [resented, a real treat, nice atmosphere, and the food was divine"
"I was staying at the hotel and had dinner here on my first night. Lovely, relaxing ambiance. I was in a group of six and we got a handful of dishes to share. The Salt and pepper squid and stir-fried XO prawns with pineapple were my favorite dishes. Very friendly and professional staff."
"It was so amazing to eat that delicious food. They had an amazing service there and the location was really nice. 
We enjoyed it and would recommend that place if you want to have a special dinner with good quality food, fabulous service and beautyful location."
"After many visits to hakkasan in Miami Beach I'm convinced that after almost 10 years in business they know what they are doing !!
From the amazing food , Peking duck , dim sum , sampei seabass ,signature fried rice !
The service matches the food , beautiful decor and great music !
It makes this place so special ...
Check out it and see it for yourself !
You are going to love it !!
Def recommend!!"
we booked this for a bachelorette dinner. The food was incredible. We had a vegan in our group and they were very accomidating to her.
"Antoine and Adriano, are great and kind waiter! Extremily switness and eficient!! The food is perfect and wonderful place!!!"
My daughter took me here for my birthday.  I wish I lived in Miami so I could go more often.  The service was top notch and the food was excellent.  I don't know if I can go to any other Chinese restaurant now and NOT compare it to Hakkasan.  If I am in Miami Beach I will definitely go back.  Food was so fresh and flavorful.  Could not have asked for a better wait staff.  Wish I remember their names.  They deserve a raise.
"The restaurant is actually within the Fountainbleau Hotel.  

We made a reservation through the hotel and didn't have to wait. The food was delicious. We had an issue with one of our dishes and it was immediately looked into, apologised and taken off the bill. The only reason I am sharing this is to highlight the good service. (the issue is irrelevant)

The ambience was nice. It was kid friendly too. 

it is bit on pricy side so not the normal family outing dinner place. If you fancy a bit of luxury and delicious food....then this is the place.

We will be going to the London one soon."
Called ahead minimal wait.Bar was acessable.  Simply Delicious 2 orders of Chilean Seabass! Fine Pino Grigio!
"Had dinner two nights ago. Dinner outstanding. Daniel B ,quite helpful with menu selections and wine pairing. All servers attentive without hovering. Maitre D introduced himself and inquired about satisfaction with meal."
"While the ambience of the restaurant and the presentation of the food is gorgeous, the food is good, not great.

I went here for my birthday with girlfriends. From the start, it was awkward. Because they wanted to put a few balloons and centerpieces, the manager was horrified and treated us like we belonged at China wok, at the airport - haha. 

As well, I felt like they really want to get you in and out of there. Our waiter continued to rush us throughout the night. 

We had the vegetable dumplings which are gorgeous, but could use more flavor. I liked the salad with plum dressing as well as the green beans with olives (just delicious).

I ordered the orange beef as it is a special dish they serve only at this location. While the presentation was lovely, it had very little taste. The vegetable fried rice was ok, and the eggplant was very good. 

I had requested a side dish of spicy sauce - which had a kick but I didn’t find it too spicy. 

The dessert while it tasted nice was average, and I could have had similar dessert at a chain restaurant. It looked like they took it out of the back, and microwaved it. Not impressed.

I have dined all over and consider myself really into food. My friends not so much. They are not as into or educated on food. I felt like because of this - the server was horrified - I kept laughing the whole time. He should really take that as an opportunity to educate on the foods of the restaurant, etc. and get people to try different things.

The service is ok- could use improvement. The food is beautiful but could use some
Improvement - the staff is nice enough, but could use improvement - average or slightly above. 

Now, I may have felt this way because I was dining with a vegetarian and many of the dishes I had were vegetarian and bland. 

Perhaps, if you order foie gras dumplings and duck- you would have a better experience. I may have come back for this, but too many restaurants in Miami to not be treated special when dining."
Had a couple of drinks at the bar. Greg the bartender was great. Enjoyed the conversation. Matthew Moll the manager is the best. Great guy. Really took care of me. We will eat there on our next trip to Miami.
Having been to the sister restaurant in London several times I was wrong to assume this would be as good... it certainly isn't. The food quality was nowhere as good as London nor indeed the service. It is located in the Fontainebleau Hotel (a cavernous place) not for the shy and retiring types! The style of the restaurant holds true to its original but that apart falls short at every step of the way... a shame as it's not a cheap dining option either. The best part of the meal was the mango custard dessert... a must.
"I dined at Hakkasan for lunch.  Ordered the prefix lunch menu. Dim sum appetizer was good.. you get 1 dumpling of squid & carrot, black rice & veg, spicy beef and lotus root. Entrees were just ok.. orange chicken (kinda had an artificial orange taste to it,  and sauteed pork choi with udon noodles (very small pieces of pork, 98% noodles). Didn't finish the 80% of the  noodles which was essentially flavored with soy sauce. Was still hungry so I ordered the fried shrimp wrapped in been curd which was really good. My advise.. just order the dimsum. Entrees are questionable - they get 2 stars.  Dim sum + ambiance + service -  4 stars . Mango custard dessert was super good!"
"We just returned from a several day stay at the Fontainebleau in Miami.  We chose to eat most of our meals in the hotel restaurants due to convenience.  As such we ate at Hakkasan two separate evenings and had several different dishes.  By far our favorites were the crispy prawns with almonds and the vegetarian chicken dish, both very favorable.  The spicy szechwan chicken was dry, the seafood dim sum lacked flavor as did dishes of lamb, scallops and other prawn dish.  The first two dishes mentioned brought us back for the second meal.  For the price of the meals and drinks here,we expected so much more.  Great waitstaff here!"
Hakkasan food is so delicious. there were three of us and we tried several dishes and all were delicious. I can't even pick out a favorite food. I will say its presentation of iced jasmine tea was the best anywhere.
"Vida the restaurant inside where this sushi establishment is located is much better .

Tried this out didn't like it at all ."
"Food was phenomenal. The stylish atmosphere was perfect. Even better than their London location. Desserts were brilliant (don't miss the mango coconut one. And the fondant was perfect too)
But - all five dishes (starters and main courses) came out of the kitchen together. They said it's the Chinese way. Don't forget to tell them to space the courses."
"Lovely was to start off my pre-birthday celebrations. When traveling from far, after a long flight its nice to find somewhere to spend a chilled out evening with a good cocktail list and delicious Cantonese food. The ambience has a luxuriously chic Asian vibe with fabulous well placed lighting. 
Perfect place for a catch up with friends, ( you can hear each other) but also nice for date night. The food and cocktails were delicious. I recommend the lobster."
"Visited Hakkasan Miami last week.
Always a pleasure as I've visited Hakkasan Mayfair a couple of times.
The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great advice.
The food was simply stunning.
Expensive but worth it for a special occasion."
Miami Spice is a great time to experience the wonderful restaurants in our area. We had dinner and it was great! Our server Ken was so attentive and the manager Francois was fantastic! Can't wait to go again!
"So... I could talk about the parking (a little bit shady), but it's not fair for the restaurant. 
We've made a reservation and we had a drink meanwhile they're preparing the table for us. 
The bar was nice. 
Dim sums were lovely, rest of the food regular and the last chicken was undercooked.
The service, disappointing. We wanted to order more food at 22.30h and he said to us that the kitchen was closing, so it was better to have a dessert and quickly. And the best part, better to pay quickly as well, cause the waiter was finishing his shift.
We also went to the terrace, but the door was closed and locked, so we had to wait for someone (by the way, another costumer) to open the door meanwhile were knocking. 
If I would come back? Maybe yes, if I go first to other restaurants near before."
"I have visited hakkasan many times in Dubai and London with it being one of the best restaurants so was hoping Miami would not fail. The ambience, cocktails didn't fail always an extensive choice. The crab and sweet corn soup was mouth-wateringly good as was the duck salad. I found the chicken satay main to be more curry flavour than satay but overlooked it because I have always rated the restaurant 11 out of 10. Attentive staff along with everything else make this a worthwhile experience."
"While we felt a little 'old' and uncool (we are under 40), we highly recommend Hakkasan.  With drinks, Dim Sum, and sharing and sampling dishes, it was half of a car payment, but totally worth it.  The lychee martini was so good and refreshingly perfect for the meal.  The Dim Sum was very good, as were the main dishes and the noodles!  Our waiter made recommendations for the menu and everything he suggested was spot on."
"Little hard to find as the restaurant is inside the Fontainebleau resort which is huge.
Nicely decorated and atmosphere is great.
Food and service were good.
I recommend a try."
"This was our second time back to Miami and we had such a good time at the Hakkasan we made it a priority to return and I am glad we did, because once again it did not disappoint. It was great to see that the service, food, atmosphere has remained top notch. Enjoyed pre-dinner cocktails and the waiter was very thorough with the menu information, made us feel that we could take our time while dining.When the bill arrived we were reminded that the tip was included in the total, thanking us for our service (something that was only done at this restaurant and we ate out frequently during our stay). One of the few restaurants that we felt service matched the gratuity amount - which we are finding is sadly becoming more rare here in this town. Keep up the great work - we will be back!"
"Make reservations, because this restaurant gets busy. While we ate in the bar, it was a great experience. I loved watching the bartenders craft cocktails while eating from the fixed menu. We were lucky to having the tasting menu as part of Miami Spice week and enjoyed the beef dish, chicken fried rice, cabbage in garlic, flounder in black bean sauce, and the most amazing mango dessert I've had. Enjoy the boozy, smokey cocktail that was so good, I forgot the name."
"Five of us went for a family dinner. All the staff were super helpful and courteous. We ordered veggie dumplings to start, followed by spicy lamb, sea bass, beef, chicken, and some spring onion egg fried rice. The lamb and beef were both lively and tender, and so was the fish, but a bit overpowered by the sauce. The chicken was dry and crusty and not that great. 
My wife and I had a glass each of Taaittinger French champagne (which was cheaper than the more ordinary Sonoma wine ???) and the 3 kids had a soda each. The bill came to $280 including deserved 20% tip. Not sure I would say the whole expwrience was worth the cost. Hence 3 stars instead of 4."
"We have dined at a few Hakkasan in other countries before, and they have all been very good. This one at Fontainbleu is probably the best! Fantastic food and brilliant service. Only regret is that we had no room left for desserts."
"My wife and I live and Miami I went there for date night on a Monday. We were warmly greeted by our server Marcos, who showed knowledge, grace and professionalism through out our dinner. Sommelier Robert came by our table and suggested a few wines to go with our dishes, all of them superb pairings. The beef with lotus root was to die for so was the steamed flounder with black bean sauce.  Manager Matthew checked on us from time to time making sure we were taking care of and we had delightful conversations. To finish everything off the chocolate mousse with passionfruit was decadent. Delicious food in a modern setting with knowledgeable service. I will come back and recommend to everyone willing to listen."
Went here for a family meal.. had a lovely time.. atmosphere great.. our waiter Stephen was so nice helping us with menu choices.. food was outstanding.. a little pricy but well worth a visit..
"Great experience, nice staff, quick service, great atmosphere. We enjoyed dinner a lot! Will definitely come back next time we're in town!"
My daughter and I had a mother / daughter trip to Miami. We had a lovely dinner and enjoyed the beautiful setting. I would say this is not a kid friendly restaurant. My daughter is 10 and an only child who often goes to fancy restaurants. I could tell the staff was a bit surprised to see a kid. But they were very kind to her and we had a very nice meal.
"The food was exceptional, with every single dish satisfying our whole family. The waiters were very helpful and knowledgable, providing an outstanding and special service. The restaurant is decorated beautifully... would highly recommend."
"We have been sampling Hakkasan""s, Miami Spice, Dim Sum menu for the past few years and always loved it.  We were not disappointed this year either.  The first course was the Dim Sum basket with 3 kinds of dumplings. The spinach and scallops dumpling was my favorite.  This was folllowed by barbecue chicken wings with lemongrass, sautéed baby bak choi and Beijing noodles 'Zhajiangmian' -bak choi was mouth watering but the noodles had a little too much soybean paste.  Finally we got the mango custard dessert (the other choice was chocolate mousse with cashew and passion fruit) yummy.
Overall we were glad we stopped by at Hakkasan.  
This menu is offered Sat and Sun, lunch time during Miami Spice (Aug thru Sept), at an unbelievable price of $23 per person."
"If you're looking for Asian cuisine that will satisfy your palate, Hakkasan is the place to go.
Friendly staff--Manager graciously introduced himself, and hostess is very helpful--she told us that their servings can be shared, so my husband and I opted for two (2) appetizers and an entrée--Dim Sum Platter and Duck Roll, Sir-fried scallop,s and fried rice.  Sure enough, what we had was more than sufficient.  Of course, we ended our meal with an order of Mango Custard, which was super delicious!  

Bon Apretit!

P.S.-- I just realized that Hakkasan is in NY, too.  We will surely visit the place."
"Very good experience and the staff was great, the menu was perfect. Love it, and I my kids and my wife having been satisfied will definitely come back. Thank you for all the attention that we have received for the all crew."
"This restaurant is located inside the Fontainebleau Hotel, very nice upscale chic exotic place. Serves tapas style modern Cantonese food. Pricy but great food."
"I have been going to Hakkasan restaurants in London, Miami, New York, and San Francisco since 2014.  I even know the specials at the different locations by heart.  All the staff members at every location are fantastic, courteous, and thoughtful, as well as the managers.  When I visit any of their restaurants I always feel like a valued customer.   Keep up the great work."
"Was the second time we have been to Hakkasan. Again it was amazing food. We went for the tradional Peking Duck. Outstanding quality. Definitely comparable to the ones we tasted in Bejing. We also had a few starters to share which were also amazing. The outstanding food combined with a really cool atmosphere  makes this place a must for peope who enjoy creative chinese food.

Only thing is that courses came really fast. For us being used to longer European dinners it was a bit of a shame to be done so quickly.

Would definitely go back."
"Hakkasan is an upscale asian restaurant chain and this outpost at the Fountainbleau Hotel is specially nice ! Beautiful decor and a vibrant bar scene, knowledgable service team and excellent food. The typical black cod, sushi, seabass in garlic ginger sauce all cooked to perfection. it's expensive, its elegant and it's special !"
"The food was fairly good but felt the it was way too over priced. Not much variety on the menu, I think my husband and I spent $180 for just the two of us at this resturant and it wasnt really what we expected. You are paying more for the atmosphere then anything else. gratuity is already included so you don't really have to worry about that. i think the food was not too bad but the atmosphere was good."
There is a simple reason Hakkasan is so highly regarded: every single aspect of the dining experience is perfection. From the staff (notable mentions include Matthew and Adriano) to the ambiance to the incredible cuisine - absolute pure dining bliss.
"A wonderful location, ambience and experience. Perfect for a special evening out. We have taken the kids twice and they loved it to. Top class menu and staff. Well worth a visit."
"We're the type of people that truly appreciate a unique dining experience and Hakkasan MORE than delivered in every way. 

Location/Setting: Super chic, intimate, east-meets-west, old-school meets modern Chinese restaurant vibe. No hanging red curtains or cheesy dragons here - just stunning blue/black/and gray accents and tons of little details down to the cutlery. 

Food: This is such a step up from any Chinese restaurant you're going to find anywhere except a city with a Chinatown district. For years, we've looked for something to beat House of Nanking in San Fran, and this was it. The Michelin stars for the exec chef are well earned (even in this Miami outpost). MUST ORDER: The dim sum sampler - each dumpling is more surprising and delicious than the next. Also, the wok-seared lamb with noodles - the perfect hit of black-pepper spicy and tender melt-in-your mouth lamb, crisp veggies, and to-die-for noodles. Ginger-strawberry bellini cocktail is simply sublime and truly readies the palate for everything to come. 

Service: Impeccable. Well attended by our helpful and knowledgeable server, and the bar staff was equally gracious and hospitable (and they also make an excellent mojito). 

Pricing: It's a bit spendy, but not out of line with anything on Miami Beach, especially for something of this quality. You will not be rushed through your meal and you will receive generous portions of food (we had leftovers from both our entrees). I don't think we even blinked at the bill because we were so pleased with our experience. However, if you do want to save $ - the best place to skip is always on alcohol - especially on Miami Beach where cocktails are more expensive than the rest of town. 

We'll be back whenever we're looking for a unique place to take out of town guests, a little romance for ourselves, or celebrating a special occasion. DO MAKE RESERVATIONS - this restaurant is located in a very, very large resort hotel and fills up quickly."
"A meal for 3 with wine and cocktails was $300 and the prawn toast were whole prawns and the dim sum mainly shellfish.

My wife opted for Assam Tea Shrimp and my daughter had Chicken Sampan Clay Pot. I had Singapore Noodles and all food was excellent with the sort of unobtrusive service you would expect from such a quality venue.

A special venue for a special occasion."
"Just visiting the epic Fontainebleau in Miami is in itself worth a visit and Hakkasan delivers a great variety of Cantonese dishes able to meet most palates. From seafood, to chicken and duck, to beef and also vegetarian. The whole experience is based on sharing and you will not be disappointed. It is pricy but definitely worth visiting!"
"this restaurant is very highly recommended, I think we spent too long on cocktails (fab cocktail bar and service) before sitting to eat, so kitchen was closing, felt a little rushed.
The food was beautiful in particular the Duck was tops."
This place is amazing. The service and the waiters knowledge of the menu was wonderful. The suggestions he gave were delicious and the food was cooked to perfection. I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he truly made our evening wonderful. I think it was Pablo but I can't be sure. So nice to visit a restaurant that has unique and flavorful food along with an amazing and knowledgeable wait staff. Thanks for a perfect evening.
Expensive but worthwhile! I had been dying to visit and I'm happy I got the chance. A feast for the eyes first then my taste buds ;)
"Since last year , it has become a regular appointment fo us. It's a little pricy but , it earns all the money you pay. Sublime Dim Sung (dumplings) , can't miss the Crispy Duck salad , beautiful bar , excellent service! (a rarity in Miami Beach)"
"Visited Hakkasan with a group of coworkers. The atmosphere is a bit of a scene - but so is everything at the Fontainebleau. Our server was attentive and offered meticulous explanations of the house specialties and other menu favorites. He also took the time to answer all of our questions in detail. The food was composed beautifully and featured creative flavor combinations. However dishes were served in small portions (we were encouraged to share, which means you get approximately 1.5 bites of each dish if you're dining in a group of 4) and of course all items were overpriced - but again, so is everything at the Fontainebleau!"
"Ate here first night in Miami ( booked ahead so that we had a decent restaurant for the first night) 
As usual , Hakkasan delivered average but expensive Chinese food in a great looking restaurant ( nothing was poor but nothing was wow , maybe I will now finally learn my lesson that there are much better Chinese restaurants out there)
I know the above sounds harsh but at $ 480 for 4 plus $140 for cocktails at the bar you should get WOW not that was pretty good ."
Def was impressed with the services as well as the interior design of the restaurant. despite the size the seating areas are arranged in a semi-private smaller areas which create a great atmosphere. Thee good was good but I thought a little bit too overrated. Drinks were really good and dessert amazing!
"Very nice restaurant 
The food is the best 
Menu have a lot of different options
The service is very good
The price is a little hi $$$$
You. Red to go!!!"
"Terrific restaurant - loved the food.  We shared the appetizers and had a chicken and beef dish.  It was very good and we had plenty to eat.  We were also excited to see the Fontainebleau's renovations, but were disappointed in the hotel's clientele.  There's nothing elegant or clique about the people in the hotel - in fact they're the exact opposite of the classic ""rat pack.""  The hotel sells day passes to anyone off the street, which appeared to be thugs and gangster/wannabes.  There only shreds of the iconic hotel to see in photographs.  This is more Disneyworld meets Vegas.  The restaurants are very good and the day passers didn't seem interested in spending their money on food - so do go for the meal."
"We came here for the dimsum lunch. We had the set menu for 45/person. There were three steamed and three fried dumplings. The steamed ones had lobster, sea bass and shrimp. The fried ones had chicken, beef and one that had and was shaped like a pumpkin. All the dumplings were delicious!!! Main entree was a choice between a BBQ platter which had pork spareribs and boneless pork or spicy chicken. We all chose the BBQ platter. Amazing! Dessert was a mango custard with coconut ice cream. This is our second time in this place and we keep coming back for more. Hakkasan is Chinese food you won't find anywhere else. Service is great as well. If you come to eat and are not staying in the hotel, have your valet ticket validated at the restaurant. It will reduce the price from 25 to 15 dollars as long as you don't stay over 5 hours. Otherwise, it will be 47 dollars."
"I absolutely love Hakkasan. There is one in my city, San Francisco, so when visiting Miami I had to check it out. They lived up to our every expectation of perfection...and more. As they are known for, the food was so delicious and satisfying. They hit the mark in every possible way - just outstanding!!
And service is remarkable, too. The staff is fantastic and ensure you experience perfection when in their care.
Will be back!!"
With a taster menu and wine package @ $500 for two adults one expects to be blown away by culinary greatness. This did not happen. The food was not bad but far from what you expect from such an established brand. Tasteless and extremely overpriced.
"We Ubered to the Hakkasan at the Fontainebleau with no reservation but Jennifer told us that there would be a table soon so we went to the bar and, 10 minutes later we did get a nice table. The food was a nice experience. I had the duck Foie gras dumplings from Hudson Valley and paired it with a full body Sangiovese. I loved it! My husband enjoyed the chicken Szechuan. It is the kind of restaurant where a waiter takes your drinks from the bar to the table. I was surprised they did not but that will not prevent us to go again for another wonderful evening."
"When you first walk in straight off the elevators into the restaurant, the entire place is gorgeous.  Most of the tables are right next to each other, so you are very close to your dining neighbor so no chance of dining intimacy on that part.  We had the Vegetarian Dim Sum Platter and the Regular Dim Sum Platter along with Hot & Sour Soup for appetizers.  The soup was delicious, but the Dim Sum platters left something to be desired, out of both platters, the regular Dim Sum platter was the best except for the duck ones, they were odd tasting.  I had some sort of Chilean Sea Bass dish which I don't see on the menu, The waiter who was very friendly and helpful (Daniel B.) I believe? He asked me what kind of fish I liked and I said something mild and he said Sea Bass, so I received the Sea Bass covered in a sticky pink sauce that was very sweet but it wasn't a grilled fish as stated on the menu, but it was tender and moist.  My Spouse got the Roasted Chicken with Spicy Garlic I believe, However, it came out and looked like a large pile of panko bread crumbs encrusted and baked on top of the chicken, you had to dig down into it to find the chicken.  It wasn't eaten and the manager was very gracious and removed it from the bill with out hesitation.  Perhaps we made the wrong choices when picking out the food items or maybe the weren't explained properly, but the actual entree/dinner items don't seem to match up with what they come out looking like.  A better explanation of how they are prepared and presented could be helpful."
"I guess any meal in any Hakkasan restaurant will be memorable. For the food, for the ambiance and for the service. This evening was surely great as we chose the tasting menu. The Peking duck and the sea bass have no comparison anywhere I have been."
"when i booked this restaurant, i was very excited. Tripadvisor has very good reviews. well, to tell you the truth, i was disappointing with the food. place is beautiful, service was great, but the food... does not worth it...
i took scallops. they were fresh, but not as delicious as i expected them to be. i tried scallops on many different places, and here  i did not like them at all..."
"I love this place, very high end, food is amazing and a great wine list. I always order the duck, it has crispy skin and juicy meat, it is the best. The almond prawns are great too. We always have a great time."
"Daniel our waiter was helpful with suggestions, and he was proven right. From the dumplings to the foie gras salad, the meal was excellent ."
"I prefer the Hakkasans in the Middle East but I actually like the Miami Beach location more than the New York restaurant.
The restaurant is dark but somewhat sophisticated however when it gets crowded the table spacing can be a little intimate.
My favorite Hakkasan food has always been the dumplings and Miami doesn't disappoint. They have lobster dumplings that should be tried. There are also dim sum platters that were good. Some dishes are hit and miss but the crispy chicken and the stir fried beef are safe bets.Desserts are a nice surprise ending.
There are very few decent or even edible Chinese restaurants in South Florida but Hakkasan fills that void and when in Miami Beach its a good bet."
"We were on our honeymoon and stayed at the hotel near by. Our friend recommended this place and it was worth to go. People treat you with respect, you definitely feel special there. Food is to die for!"
"We were on holiday from London and stumbled across Hakkasan on TripAdvisor. We have 2 in London but have never visited as we were unsure what to expect. Our first visit to Hakkasan was was exceptional and we ended up eating here 2 nights on our 7 night holiday. Can't fault anything. Menu is for sharing which is great as you get to try lots of dishes. The duck rolls are amazing, the best I've ever had. Now very much looking forward to trying out their London restaurants!"
"I can't say enough about the care taken and quality of the food here, the service is almost as good, but a server calling everyone Guy's when they're are ladies present at the table is a pet level of mine and always annoys me, other than that all was great, Dim Sum, Crispy Duck Salad and lobster were all cooked to perfection."
"I wanted to personally send a big ""thank you' to the guys at Hahhansan Miami, especially Marcos who was the server that helped during our visit. It was simply AMAZING, everything on the menu was good... I am horrible with names so please forgive me with the name of the dishes but those jumbo shrimp with spicy sauce and almonds were heaven. Those green beans, the seabass and that fried chicken rice and no less the chocolate dessert. 
I can't wait to be back in town to visit this place again."
"We decided to try Hakkasan this year as it was in our hotel. 

We were a little reluctant as we wanted to venture out of the Hotel since we had one night booked at (scarpetta)

Glad we decided to give Hakkasan a go. 

The service was excellent. Great drinks, atmosphere and attention. 

We tried numerous dishes as a group and all were well received. 

Cripsy duck salad, duck rolls, crispy duck. Dumplings, the food was fantastic and did not dissapoint. 

We tried 4 of the deserts and again, fresh and tasetfull. 

Espresso's. Coffees etc...were OK but obviously not what they concentrate on. 

Price is on higher end but expected for this type of food and area. 

Will return."
"When your left at the bar for 30 mins and have to ask three times when you can take your table it's not the best start. Especially when there's not even a sorry. 

Food was generally good. Service ok. This really doesn't stand up to the consistent quality of London and NY. The menu is also limited. We had the 'crispy beef' Miami special. It was the least 'crispy' dish I've ever eaten. I told the waitress it was delicious but just not crispy. We then had a train of people come and apologise for this dish. I've never heard the word crispy so many times!!!! They took it off the bill. 

The beauty of Alan Yau's restaurants is they always provided pin sharp efficient service with stunning cuisine. This looks the part but the staff let it down."
Late night dinner. We enjoyed our drinks at the bar. Smoked Negroni was awesome. Food was amazing so do server.
"We ate a few dishes here, sampling the menu. Everything was very tasty and not your standard Asian food. Would definitely go again."
Staff very polite and attentive. Lots of options on the menu for drinks and food. Biggest gripe is the insanely slow and long valet wait for the return of our vehicle (~40 minutes!!).
"We went for our friends birthday and it was perfect! The food was on point, the service was excellent. Our server, Adriano, took excellent care of us. Definitely recommend it for anyone traveling to Miami."
"The restaurant was great and the food was amazing!! Great atmosphere and Adriano made the experience and memorable occasion.

If you like unique, secluded and special... go table 300."
"Atmosphere was perfect..food was delicious and service was outstanding.  Irina knew her menu and was so natural, best service I ever had. I give Irina 5 stars."
"I love coming here service,drinks and the Best dim sum!!! The duck salad is delicious! The specialty drinks are all made with fresh juices.. ginger,beet whatever you want they juice it!!"
we had a large business  dinner with a menu pre-ordered.  The food was truly excellent and delivered in a steady stream with pleasant and helpful staff. The wine list was absurdly expensive.  We managed to drink the cellar out of some of the modestly (under $90) priced wines.  However all in all it was an excellent evening much appreciated by the clients who were universally happy.
"Our dinner was excellent! Great ambiance and menu very similar to other branches - so, it is easier to enjoy your meal... Very attentive and polite service, by an Asian waitress. Decent prices! The only negative is its location - hard to find spot inside the Vegas style Fontainebleau hotel... Ah, be aware Uber pickup location (when leaving the hotel) is not the same as the drop-off..."
"Tried chef's special tasting menu (starters, sea food, duck and wagu beef, desert). Amazing variety if you are looking for trying specials. Really tasty and astonishing quality. Wine pairing is a must (champagne, white&red, porto). Definitely best Asian food in Miami"
"REALLY good dim sum! The food was very tasty. We found the dim sum menu was a tad overwhelming for a huge group of hungry girls, so we opted for the vegetarian prix-fixed menus. 45$ a person (not including alcohol) but the food was so good, and it kept coming. Our non-veggie friends enjoyed the pork belly and fried rice. I recommend going at night though, as the ambiance doesn't really fit the sunny miami vibe."
"Very very very good, like the one in London 
Good location and ambience 
Good food and good music 
Perfect service"
"This was our second visit to this great restaurant and again it was a huge success. This time we brought my patents and our son and everyone loved it! Special thanks to our amazing server, Julia, who graciously agreed to serve us again even so it wasn't her service area. Her advises and recommendations were very helpful and made out dishing experience truly amazing!"
"Having tried the sister company in London thought it would be nice to see what Miami had to offer. Food was nothing more than average and trust me I eat out nearly every night.
Couldn't put my finger on why the atmosphere felt sterile inside. Service was good apart from the staff congregated near our table while inputting orders. FYI management need to sort that it felt intrusive.
Wouldn't go back to Miami one but still enjoy the London one."
"Went to dinner with my family of three,
Been to Mr chows and honestly would never go back.  I was well aware that this restaurant was going to be expensive , but after ordering 4 appetizers , three dinners and a fried rice, my son didn't eat because he didn't like it. Very small plates , food just ok. Bill was $300 plus.
No white rice included. 
I tried it , but won't be back."
"We were greeted by a kind host, seated, treated well. The food including the dumplings, orange chicken and 2 varieties of fried rice were delicious. I can't wait to go back. the atmosphere plus the food plus the service were a trifecta!"
"We went to Hakkasan for my sons birthday. Everything about it was exceptional! Our waiter Daniel was great about learning our preferences and made wonderful suggestions for our meal. The food was really outstanding - my son said it was his favorite meal in Miami. We were lucky enough to get a tour of the culinary operations and the kitchen was so clean, organized and well run. It is an absolute must for dinner if you are in the Miami area!"
The restaurant was amazing from the service to the decor the food is the best in Miami it was so good I'm going to Vegas in may and my 1st stop for dinner will be hakkasan
"Things you will notice upon arrival of this place: The ambiance, the sexy, the trendy. Love the environment as well as the food! Now, be ready to break bread, because it is not cheap, and could lead most to the poorhouse, but I think the experience, the food/drinks and the ambiance of Hakkasan is worth it. 

The food is a la carte, so as you order, they bring out the plates (similar to tapas). I recommend the Dim Sum, pretty much what they are known for. Rumor has it, that their Sunday brunch give you more Dim Sum options, for better cost. 

The crowd was diverse, of all age groups. I didn't notice kids and wouldn't recommend, because this place seems for the ""grown and sexy"". Good for a pre-night out or couples. 

This was our second time here, so me and my girl enjoyed everything about this place. Thumbs up!"
"I came for dinner whit friends, the restaurant looking beautiful, amazing, very elegant and very well furnished!
The food it's very good and amazing looking. 
The staff was very nice and helpful!
Thank you for the fantastic experience!!
Absolutely recommended and definitely come back again.
Thanks!"
"Stayed at the hotel a few times now and have absolutely loved it. The service from every angle of the hotel is phenomenal. One of our favorite restaurants is Hakkasan as it has outstanding food and fantastic service.  The bartenders we had the pleasure of spending time with, Greg and Mauricio, had in-depth product knowledge of both food and drinks. All cocktails we have tried have been tasty and the food has never been disappointing. The dim sum is perfection! 

One of the Managers, Mathew Moll, was very accommodating (since we didn't have a reservation) and provided us with unbelievable hospitality. These three gentlemen are the reason we keep going back!"
"Each course at Hakkasan was terrific.  We didn't have the tasting menu as I am gluten free, but they had more than enough options for me on the menu.  I particularly recommend the Crispy almond pear prawns and the Crispy beef tenderloin with tangerine peel."
"an unforgettable evening of superlatives, a magnificent experience, food and a pleasant ambience in a perfect symbiosis"
"We had dinner at the restaurant while staying at the Fontainebleu hotel.  From the minute you step off the elevator you can tell that this place is something different.  The seating was elegant and banquet style with soft pillows and the tables were not too close together with cutout wood and mirrored dividers.  The waitress was very low-key and not pushy.  We had the crystal lobster dumplings, duck rolls, lemon chicken, stir fry grouper, crispy sea bass and jasmine rice.  Everything was delicious and beautifully presented.  It also gave my 14 year old son an opportunity to expand his taste buds and practice with chop sticks.  There were so many things I wanted to try that we will have to go back.  We didn’t go out of the comfort zone since our picky son was with us.  We had the warm chocolate fondant (similar to a lava cake) and praline ice cream for dessert.  It was heavenly.  Even though this is a romantic restaurant I like the idea of eating there with a larger group so you can try more things!"
"We made a reservation for the 5 of us to come here on a Monday evening and had a fantastic time. After sitting at the bar for a drink prepared by the very friendly bartender, we were seated. The house sommelier picked out a bottle of wine and a few tasty appetizers to go with it. None of them - beef ribs, duck salad, and dim sum - disappointed. We also shared all of the entrees, including crispy beef tenderloin, stir fried grouper; schezhuan chicken and wok-based lobster. All of the dishes were incredible and the service exemplary."
"everything is perfect from a to z, food excellent,ambiance very hip,dj is playing nice house songs,fast service waiters and stuff very polite..."
"My wife loved the Dim Sum! We ate here several times during our week stay at the Fontainebleau. We had the Taste of Hakkasan the first night which was fantastic and got us hooked. We came back two more nights, ordering the Dim Sum platter and the Crispy Duck salad as our appetizers both nights they were so good. The Black Pepper Beef and Wagyu beef are great main courses. Don't remember that the wife had for her main courses last two nights. My wife had the Floating Goddess and I had the Old Cuban and the Frescor for drinks which were all very good. I would recommend making reservations ahead of time as one night they said the earliest was 11pm! I would definitely recommend for any trip to the Miami area. I know it will be my list the next time I return to Miami!"
"We went to Hakkasan for dinner. We ordered the prawns with mango, honey glazed sea bass, beef peppercorn, lemon chicken and yang cheow fried rice. Everything was good! Our server was very attentive. Food came out quicker than we expected. Bill was over 200 dollars but I expected it to be on the high side. We will definitely be back!"
Outstanding food and service. Look of restaurant is exceptional. Every bite was amazing. The lobster dumpling is to die for. The fruit platter to finish up an exceptional dinner was abundant. The sake was excellent and their sake menu extensive. Highly recommended.
"Simply amazing food!  We had the waygu beef, duck salad and an AMAZING desert!!  This place is expensive (my bourbon was $55 a glass).  However the food is incredible!"
"On a girls trip (5 people) and stayed at the Fontaineblue which is why we ate here. Restaurant is inside the resort. We decided to do drinks and appetizers because we were warned that the menu was super expensive with small portions. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and 4 different appetizers. The spicy margarita was awesome! The crusted shrimp, potstickers, lettuce wraps were equally amazing. Would definitely try this restaurant again."
This restaurant had very tasty food. It reminded me of every other overpriced menu on miami beach. what made the restaurant worth going to was the service. Our food was brought at a timely manner and everyone was very friendly. It is very much a great experience and I would return again.
Outstanding food and service. Solid atmosphere. Extensive menu options. Clearly a 5 star experience. Will definitely visit again.
"Brought my family of finicky eaters and they loved it. World class meal matched by perfectly responsive service from Daniel M. He took the time to understand my daughters' unique tastes and my wife's disdain for seafood to produce a wonderful experience.

Highly recommend to all ages."
The entire experience from the time you are seated until you decide you have finished your meal was exceptional. This is a first class restaurant and a fully enjoyable experience from the first course to the last.
"The food was prepared perfectly, the service outstading.  The desserts especially the (MANGO) was incredible."
"Although a bit pricey the food/drinks were delicious. I would recommend for a date night as the restaurant is dimly lit and nicely decorated.  The server was very pleasant and not too overbearing which I like. We also had great service from the bartender while we were waiting for out table. 

I would highly recommend the green beans! They are everything!!"
"I was never a big fan of Chinese cuisine until I meet hakkasan... it was love at first bite! <3
I've been there for 3 or 4 times and each one was an unique experience of flavors and hospitality.  I higly recommend Mauricio or Manon, if you stay at the bar. Although all people who work there are fantastic and the food, is exquisite!
I really recommend the dumplings and the duck salad, the french beans, and the sampei chicken. To drink: try Serpent’s Tongue (the best!) and Frescor (really refreshing) or Hakka if you like something more sweet.
Great ambience, great service and great food!"
Ate at the Las Vegas location 2 years ago and my recollection was that it was much better. Food here good but not great. Music horrible. Prices insane
"Located in more than a dozen locations (ranging from NY, SF, to Dubai), S. Florida's Hakkasan is located on Miami Beach in the iconic Fountainbleu Hotel.  Unless you're staying locally, hotel Valet Parking is the only way In & Out (Note: ""validated"" hotel parking costs $15, and there's typically a 15-20 minute wait for your car).  A walk thru the hotel lobby (with scenic views of the pool area, and thru the spacious lobby with architect Morris Lapidus-inspired black bow ties-in-the-white-marble) is enjoyable.
The Hakkasan interior is gorgeous -- an incense-scented beehive of comfortable seating alcoves.  The service is proficient and professional.  We've enjoyed dinning at this restaurant many times, and tonight stuck with several favorites:
The Hakka cocktail - vodka, lychee, sake -- MUST TRY!! One of the best drinks in-town
Jasmine smoked tea ribs - a Hakkasan classic appetizer
Pi Pa Roasted Duck - MUST TRY!! You'll rarely if ever have more delicious duck!!
Stir-fried French green beans w/ preserved olives - Delicious! Must try!!
Grilled Honey Sea Bass - Succulent! Delicious! Fish lovers MUST TRY!!
Stri-fried eggplant w/ King soya sauce - yum!!
Hakka noodles w/ mushrooms - Delicious! One of our favorites!
Mango custard w/ coconut sorbet dessert - refreshing & delicious!
Yes, every single food item we sampled was outstanding (and on this occasion we did not have ""enough dinners"" to order: Hakkasan's famous dim sum dumplings, stir-fried scallops, Peking duck, black pepper beef tenderloin, or their luscious chocolate fondant dessert).
Hakkasan is expensive (certainly budget $100 per person, or more), but is truly exceptional in every way.  It makes for an amazing ""special occasion"" restaurant, or more often if it's within your budget.  The Miami & Miami Beach area has A LOT of truly outstanding restaurants, and among this group Hakkasan is very solidly among the very, very best !!"
"A very dark, kind of underground, cool crowd restaurant, loud, a lot of young people, a lot of vibes going on. The Chinese food is amazing, especially the chicken and shrimp, a place to have dinner before a night out, not necessarily for a date with a loved person."
"Very good food here and the service is excellent.
As previous posters have said it is not cheap but you get what you pay for and if you want to spoil yourself go here"
"great service, very attentive to detail.  food was superb, Make your reservations far in advance.  We had the duck which was awesome and the chilean sea bass which was to die for with the Jasmine rice.  It is pricey but worth the visit."
"Good service up until we were seated.
The waiter (an American accent and name so we presume American), whilst being told that one of us was vegetarian, then kept pointing out and recommending the fish dishes to the vegetarian eater....  We don't believe there was a language barrier as we're English.

The dishes were larger than we thought or what we're used to but that's not an issue.

We ordered a fair amount of food, and to be fair, the majority of it was ""OK"".  It was what it said it would be on the menu but nothing spectacular which was a real shame as we had expected so much more from the place.

Very pricey and average food given the reviews and location."
"If you need a restaurant to prove that Miami has restaurants that can compete on a national level, look no further than Hakkasan. Tucked away in a corner of the Fontainebleau hotel; this gem delivers. We were served by Bon-and she is amazing. Kind, funny, knowledgeable , and just the right amount of table presence. Not overbearing, but magically there every time you need a cocktail or a plate removed. Try the duck salad, lobster dumplings, pipa duck, and tea smoked ribs. Make sure to wash it down with an amazing bottle of wine served by the unpretentious and wise Brian, head somm. If you love Asian food, fine dining, or just an incredible meal head to Hakkasan."
"We are no strangers to Hakkasan, this place if perfect for a date night and even a celebration. if your a lover of good food... this is the spot"
"Have been to the London Hakkasan and was delighted to see that the Miami one was fantastic too. Located in the hotel it looks beautiful, the staff were really knowledgeable and the food was sensational!"
"My first time visiting, and had Daniel as my waiter. Not only did he steer me to some great dishes, but he made sure I didn't over order, and that each dish complemented the other.  I went back a second time and asked to be seated with him again.  Great service and delicious food!"
"We really enjoyed our meal here. The cocktails were well mixed and the food very tasty. We had the espresso martini and the serpents tongue, both far better than the cocktails we had before leaving our hotel. For starters we had the crispy beef tenderloin and the dim sum. The beef was excellent, loved the flavour and the pancakes (although at $38 it should be). The dim sum were good but not outstanding, fresh and light but it would have been nice to have a little surprise like a twist of ginger or chilli of cardamom somewhere to just lift them to the next level. For mains we ordered the sweet and sour pork with pomelo, jasmine rice and chicken vermicelli. The pork was again first class, tasty but not overly sweet which some S&S can be. The noodles were light and the rice simple but exactly what we ordered. 

The service was great really attentive but not overbearing. Overall a great meal and all that came in at $150 ish."
"Either for Dim Sum or for dinner please go and check this magnificent restaurant at the great Fountainebleau hotel, the most iconic and famous here. Food like always awesome I mean everything and won't be disappointed. It's bar it is huge and diversity of spirits from all over the planet. Mgr gave us a comp drink got me and my friends for the extra waiting for our table. For after dinner drinks go downstairs to the Blue Bar and feel you are in the movie Goldfinger with 007 filmed there 1964. Thx to Miami Tours Plus on 1564 Washington Ave ask for Jp"
"Whenever we're in London, we visit Hakkasan Hanway Place and Hakkasan Mayfair, our favourite Asian fusion restaurant with a terrific style and atmosphere. We're big fans, so now we were in Miami we had to go to Hakkasan, located in the Fontainebleu Hotel. 

Entering the restaurant immediately led to good memories: the Miami place is also very recognisable with all the features we already know for years from the London venues: very attentive staff, dark coloured wood, mysterious styling and dito music, all together it's a great experience.

Bon, our sweet Thai waitress, served us. She was wonderful and added even more to our Hakkasan night out. We chose our favourite dishes: spicy duck salad, fried rice, satay, dim sum platter, lamb rack. All accompanied by a bottle of Chardonnay. A visit to Hakkasan does not come cheap, but is worth every penny. We're fans for life!"
"The dim sum was delicious, we've had better vegetable pan fried dumplings tho. The Spring Onion & Egg Fried Rice was delicious. The cocktails were great too & seemed larger than usual. Bottom line is we've had equally good, upscale Chinese food & didn't have to pay so much. $135 for the 2 of us. Good ambiance tho. I'd still give it 5 stars tho."
We could have traveled far and wide and not had a greater meal than we had at Hakkasan.  Our only regret is that we live in Boca Raton and it's a little too far to drive to dinner!
"This was our 2nd visit to Hakkasan, and I don't know why it took us so long to return.  It's truly outstanding in every way.  The portions are larger than you'd expect; we were told that for two, we should order 2 small plates and 2 entrees plus a side.  Well, the small plates were plenty, so we ended up only ordering 1 entree.  But there's so much to choose from, it's hard to pick!  Everything is so delicately flavored, so special.  The service was great and of course the space is amazing.  We won't wait so long between visits next time!"
"Service was great.  food exeeded expectation. Try Dim Sum, Lobster stir fry, cocktails were also good."
"One you are  at the Fontainebleau
Two you are getting top end dim sum
Three you are surrounding by extremely well done interiors ...you must also feed your eyes
Fourth the staff wants you to be there and they make it their job to delight you

You need more...reread the four points above"
"Very little to say really other than you always always always deliver amazing food, great service, cool atmosphere and truly know how to do it right. We were chatting at our table and saying how rare it is for a manager of a restaurant (especially in Miami) to come over and greet guests/check how everything is going - as if by magic he appeared and did just that!!!!
You guys are number 1 without doubt.
Until next time........"
We have enjoyed a great dinner. Food is amazing. Service of great quality. The Pekin Duck dish is the best I have ever tasted. Don't miss it.
"i loved the dim sum and everyone else found everything very tasty, but I wasn't really iimressed with the food.  I think the amazing atmosphere made me anticipate something wildly new and different,"
Bon was our server she did an amazing job recommending how much food to order as it was our first time dining here. Family style meals with a Great selection Everything we had was Amazing
"Very tasty food, extremely helpful and attentive service.  A little obnoxious on the pricing, though it is Miami.  Ambience was delightful."
"I've been coming to Miami in February for 10 year
I ALWAYS BOOK AT Hakkasan

The food is immense 
So so tasty 
The vibe is perfect and the waiter I had this time was perfect 
So so attentive and genuinely interested 
I would recommend this place 100 percent 
Book!"
"The food was excellent.  Only a few of the dishes were typically Chinese, but they were all Chinese inspired, and superbly executed.  Really, every bite was delicious.  The decor was SOBE cool, and the service couldn't have been more attentive.  The drinks were excellent too.  My only slight complaint would be the pounding, dance club music in the background -- more appropriate for a club than for a restaurant with food of that quality.  If I were the owners, I would consider changing it."
"Beautiful place, very much buzzy and lively. Excellent service from the moment you walk in until you leave. Very attentive and knowledgeable  waitress as well as the sonalier who recomended a great wine. Food was amazing as you would expect from a top restaurant. Be sure to book in advance as it is full all the time."
"Nothing more to say..
Have recently visited Hakkasan in London and Shanghai. 
This was the same standard. Super food, great service and lovely drinks!
Complaints? None! We will return!"
"Great service & unusual offerings ..... delicious. Multiple small plates to share, there were 4 of us ... food well presented, very artistic."
"This has all the qualities one would expect from an upscale, extremely expensive restaurant e.g.... great, innovative food ; impeccable service and an interesting vibe. But, the constant tremble and base pounding, that you may find at a club, was so distracting it was all we could think about. Some what spoiled it for us.

"if you like exotic food, specially chinesse this is a great place. the cocktails are so good and the environment is perfect, modern oriental style."
"Great room, super Menu, super service.
Would seek out this venue on trips to other locations.
Tad pricy but OK."
"Must start off and say this was a company gathering, and everything was prearranged for our menu.

However, I must say that I would not have ordered many of the items that were brought to our tables - without knowing what I was going to order.

With that being said, everything that was brought, from the first course I felt I must try. Some items were okay...most everything was very good to excellent.  I am glad that I did not need to make any decisions on menu choices, and this gave all of us the chance to try a superb variety.

The staff were extremely helpful and attentive. 

This was a most enjoyable & memorable dining experience for our week."
"Let's start with the pretty. The restaurant is beautiful. It's a large restaurant, but the manner in which it is laid out creates a sense of intimacy. I posted a picture of the restaurant showing its wooden walls that mimic the paper walls in a traditional Japanese restaurant, resulting in small groups of tables that create a sense of warmth and comfort.

The Good: Appetizers - Crispy Shredded Beef in Chinese Honey served with Mandarin Pancakes; Dim Sum Platters (especially the duck)
                  Dinner: Charcoal Grilled Honey Chilean Sea Bass - sweeter than the typical soy based preparation and a very generous portion
                  Deserts: Selections of Homemade Macarons - just about a perfect way to end the meal (I've included a picture of the macarons)

The Bad (actually, not that bad, just not worth getting): Stir-fry XO prawns with pineapple - very bland with really just no taste beyond simple shrimp; Asparagus with lotus root and lily bulbs - again, no punch to the flavor. - essentially, just cooked asparagus

Two other notes. The service was very efficient, prompt and courteous. It is a very expensive restaurant.

A suggestion: It's hard to go wrong if you stick with the house specialties, each indicated as such by an asterisk on the menu."
"Went to this place for the first time on Monday evening and all I can say is what a great start to the week. Pre-dinner drinks at the bar with a hospitable bartender who was quick and on point. Seated on time for dinner. We ordered a sampler of food for the table, which consisted of Peking Duck (amazing), a Dim Sum Platter that had 4 types in it, spicy prawns with lily and almond, jasmine tea smoked short rib (amazing), sauteed chicken, black pepper beef and steamed lobster. I can honestly say everything was cooked to perfection and on point. We constantly had food brought out as we finished another dish and was just a great full foodie experience. I would highly recommend. Only downside is it is on the 4th floor of the hotel and you have to Valet park with the hotel."
Great and friendly service. Was there on Sunday for the dim sum. A definite must try Chinese restaurant. Will be back for more!
"Dined at Hakkasan to kick off the Chinese New Year and the food, as always, reigned supreme!  Great bar, predictably delicious food, great atmosphere and fantastic service are the first things that come to mind when describing a dining experience at Hakkasan on Miami Beach. 

The staff truly hits the A level service rating each and every time and the food and drinks are always great.  I love the Mushroom Lettuce wraps and the spicy chicken dish as well as the vegetarian dumplings.   The desserts aren't too bad either!

Always worth a visit despite having to awkwardly navigate through the massive Fontainebleau Hotel lobby...."
"I was there with my husband and son.  We were greeted with a smile and had a drink at the bar before our table was available. 
Our waiter was attentive and explained many things about the menu. If it wasn't for him, we would have ordered too much. 
From the gluten-free menu I had the scallops, veggies and rice. The portions were large and cooked and seasoned to perfection. I do suggest that they serve the gluten-free dishes on different plates. It gets confusing when all the dishes are placed on the table and one must recall the gluten-free ones. 
Even though the restaurant was packed, we received quick service with absolutely no hassles.  Everyone was quite professional. 
Overall, it was a perfect experience."
"First Time diners at Hakkasan and my wife is still raving about the food. The food was outstanding as well as the decor. We had a few drinks at the bar as there was a wait for our table. The bar scene was quite busy. We tried the Hakka an also a Pink Mojito which was absolutely amazing. Great service from our waiter Ernesto, he recommended us the beef short ribs and the vegetable wraps which my wife loved. We also had the Wagu Beef and also the Hakkasan noodles which were both fantastic. Cant wait to come back and try some more dishes as the menu is quite extensive."
The food was exceptional. We ordered way too much but every bite was just as delicious as it looked. The restaurant has a very confused interior and its easy to get lost inside. I got the feeling that Hakkasans reputation has made it a place to be seen for the whos who of Miami.
"Wow ..First time in Hakkasan ..we were there for a friend""s birthday and were completely amazed with the food and the service. Dim Sum was to die for ..I'm not a fan of duck but the recommendation by our server Bon on the crispy duck salad was on point. Will definitely be back ."
"The food was very good, the service outstanding and ambiance unbeatable. I did however expect a tiny bit more in the way of presentation and flavor for the price. Just my opinion. The salt and pepper squid was amazing, the dim sum was ok. They snuck in a little curry in the duck dim sum which I do not care for. The others were just not exploding with flavor. Again, everything else was great!"
The interior architecture and design of the restaurant makes for a more intimate atmosphere. The food is quite good (better than the over-priced and bland competition at Mr Chow) and the service was excellent.
"Hakkasan offers a fantastic ambiance to enjoy some pretty outstanding food. We ordered a variety of dishes and some random cocktails and were happy with everything except the crispy orange chicken which the waiter took off the bill. Other than that, great service and would definitely recommend."
"The decor, ambience, service and food quality were perfect. We had a varied selection of dishes from the menu and were not disappointed. The Chef & his team's culinary talent were ever present  and appreciated. The Servers & management team excelled and were at hand to replenish as required. Thoroughly recommended."
"I have eaten at Hakkasan before and left with a very favorable impression.  This visit mirrored the first.  Very trendy and cool venue.  The food was absolutely delicious, the wine list quite good and the service excellent.  Highly recommend."
Love the food; service; location - in hotel.  Asian food with a twist.  Many dishes can be shared.  Ask about the amount of spice in different dishes.
"Family dinner at Hakkasan. 
Despite the name that can lead you to think of other regions it is an excellent Chinese restaurant with very friendly service and many vegetarian/vegan options. 
A little hard to reach as it is inside the huge Fontainebleau hotel but worths a visit"
"Everytime we are in Miami we can't wait to come to Hakkasan . Food is amazing, ambiance super and great service..... and this time we met Justin Bieber, my daughter was stunned !!!"
"Wow! Just the location itself (inside the Fountainebleau) makes this place special. We had dinner and drinks here, and everything that we ate was delicious. The best dishes that we had were Dim Sum and the seabass, but everything was great. The cocktails were excellent- we had cosmopolitans and sloe gin fizzes. The service was professional and fast. It can be very hard to get a reservation, so you must be sure to try well in advance. I will definitely return!"
"My first time at Hakkasan and I do not regret it! Although it's pricey it's worth the experience. I had the Duck Salad as starter and the Steamed chilean sea bass as main course. The duck was really crispy, just delicious. So was the sea bass. Cooked to perfection. I also had a very delicicious dessert (mousse aux 2 chocolats).
Service was very attentive, but not pushy. Can only recommed it!"
First time at Hakkasan - pleasantly surprised. Pricey but very nice. Black pepper beef was outstanding along with chicken fried rice. Rest of dishes we ordered we're also very good but these 2 were over the top. Great service to boot.
"The welcome a,d the service is perfect, nice persons and very helpful.

However the food is average and any chinese restaurant in town could do the same for less than 50 pc of the price. The cook has strange ideas : chilean sea bass with sort of bbq saice . May be someone should taste fi'st before offering this at the menu. Products should be respected so that u still know the real taste of what u eat. The lemon chicken, poor chicken ending in a too sugared sauce , lemon looked like artificial not even a sloce of lemon in the sauce. I thought i was in one of the best restaurant in the world. May be the chef should spend some time in the London restaurant which is perfect in all respect. I hope that last night was just an exceptional missed time for good foot. I shall hesitate to come back and will definitely go the London real Hakkasan."
"There are two kinds of reviews for Hakkasan. One is for those of us lucky enough to have visited the original restaurant at it's edgy Central London location and the other is for everyone else. 

Hakkasan Miami, compared to it's original, is like comparing a tandem bicycle to the latest Bugatti. A tandem will get you to your destination but you'll be disheveled when you get there and your bum or your calves will ache. Or both. Hakkasan Miami will address your hunger, but then so will McDonalds. 

The London original is cooler than a shaven polar bear in the North Pole. Approached, somewhat alarmingly, via a dark alley the restaurant's dark, stunning and pristine. The Miami Satelite is brash, bright and smells. 

The food from London is spectacular, unique and a culinary tour de force. Miami is kind of like a bad Chinese restaurant who's struck a deal with the local MSG supplier on an 'all you can fry' basis. Tasteless, insipid and disappointing. The menus of each share only the extreme pricing strategy but London's worth every penny. When the check arrives in Miami I felt like a bank teller facing a stick-up. 

Add to this the fact that instead of the threat of death from the London dark alley approach (itself adding to the restaurants club-like credentials), Miami is accessed through the lobby of the Fontainebleau. Which is kind of like your school hall with chandeliers and tourists as badly dressed as your geography teacher. 

London and Miami share not much else other than a name. I fail to believe that hidden in the depths of a contract between the owners and the franchise there isn't the opportunity to step in and insist on a re-boot. 

Now where's the valet with my Bugatti?"
"I have always enjoyed dim sum. Dumplings are one of my favorite foods in the world.  With some time to kill before my flight after a cruise I was hankering for some and stumbled across Hakkasan thanks to YELP. I can't begin to express how glad I am that I did.

Our server, Daniel M., was knowledgeable and attentive.  As we were deciding what to order, he was not only able to give some advice on how much to order for 2 of us, but also as to what some of his favorite dishes were, how many pieces on each dish, and what some of the guest favorites were. Let me tell you, he did not steer us wrong.

For 2 of us we went A La Carte (there is also a Prix Fix Lunch option) and got some Crispy Duck Rolls, Crab Soupy Dumblings, Crystal Lobster Dumplings, Chicken Fried Rice, and the BBQ Meat Platter.  The only item I would not give 5 stars to was the Fried Rice. It was still great, but I am definitely sticking to the Dim Sum and Meat options next I go back, and I will be back.  The dumplings were perfectly steamed and stuffed with mostly season crab and lobster: very little to no extra filler. The BBQ meat platter was HUGE and perfect for a 2 person entree even though it is technically an appetizer.  The duck was crisp skinned, rendered fat, and juicy meat (aka perfection), the Pork Belly was fantastically tender and the Char Siu was my favorite as the ribs were cooked to perfection with the lightest touch of a deliciously caramelized glaze. The Soupy Crab Dumplings left nothing to be desired. They were well seasoned, steamed to perfection, and with a great broth inside. But the stars of the show were the Crispy Duck Rolls (STUFFED WITH DUCK MEAT) and the Lobster Dumplings (if you have ever wanted to know what Umami is all about, this is the dish for you).

All I can say is thank you Chef for a fantastic meal and thank you Daniel for service to match. Go here for a special day or night out on Miami Beach."
"Deep in the Fontainebleau hotel you will find this amazing Japanese restaurant .
the dim sum is to die for the staff and atmosphere make for a great dining experience .
Once you step in you will know this is going to be great."
"Pricey, but exquisite food and service in an upscale atmosphere. Enjoyed the 4 course dinner and drinks. The place to go for an exceptional dinning experience on Miami Beach."
"As my title suggests, 150 of us took over Hakkasan last Thursday for a corporate event. 

How the staff managed to look after us so well and serve up such beautiful presented, fantastically flavoured courses, one after another, is beyond me! They also kept the vast array of cocktails on offer flowing all night, again a huge feat for so many people. We could not fault anything, other than the fact we were all still full after having lunched at Truluck's earlier in the day. That's our loss!

There is a bit of a trek to find the restaurant within the hotel but it's worth it, the decor and ambience was fabulous. We hope to visit Miami again soon, this will be on our to do list."
"I absolutely love the dim sum at Hakkasan London. The Miami branch is still a very good dim sum restaurant but it doesn't live up to its London sister's standards. Not sure why..? Also in terms of ambience, being a part of a massive hotel takes away the intimate upmarket feel. Still decent food and drinks though."
"I made reservations for 6 at Hakkasan for Saturday night. I have read several reviews before selecting it as our Saturday night dining choice. Lets me say, it did not disappoint. Daniel took great care of us. He made several suggestions and they were to die for. This place has top notch service, atmosphere and very attentive to your needs. I was shazamming a song (btw they play great music) and few minutes later Daniel came over with the name of the artist and the song, in case I was unable to Shazam it. Would definitely recommend. Ty Hakkasan for a great evening and food."
"lively restaurant and super popular, so book a reservation. I ate there twice and tried both the tasting and regular menus.   In a group, just order a la carte, and share. But for our dinner with just two, the tasting menu gave a sampling of a lot of their dishes
everything was great, but definitely order the Crispy Peking Duck!  comes with feather light wraps, with onion, cucumber and a sweet sauce.  fried rice is also good. surprisingly good desert."
"Great service by Daniel (formerly worked at hotel pool; now lunch waiter) Good variety of tasty dishes. Getting to the restaurant is another story!!! There is NO HANDICAPPED ACCESS!!! So, if you are disabled, forget about it! It is TWO flights of stairs from the lobby of the hotel, making tr nearly impossible for anyone disabled to get to. It is hard to understand why management does not care about this & allows it. Why has the ADA not stepped in? The restaurant would have a 5 star review if not for this HUGE issue."
"Amazing food and service! Special thanks to our server Julia, who made the excellent suggestion for our food and drinks! The food was superb! Great flavors and everything was cooked to perfection! An amazing desert of mango mousse on a house was a great touch! So nice! Definitely will be back!"
It was my first time and it was difficult to choose some plates and more because they did not have my fist choice but with some recommendations from the waitress it was amazing. It has an amazing combinations of flavors and the waiters are first-class. The place is astonishing with amazing decoration. The only negative is that the price is high.
"We came here for a last minute dinner. We were staying at the hotel, but had started our night at a Sushi restaurant (see our review on Sushi Garage). We ended up having to walk out of the Sushi place because they refused to feed our son who has a Dairy allergy. It was an awful experience and the first time that had ever happened to us. We had heard great things about Hakkasan so we decided to return to the hotel and eat here. Although the meal was very pricey, we knew that though when we chose to go there. The food and the service was incredible. Our waiter was amazing. He knew all the ingredients and knew exactly what our son could and couldn't eat. Thankfully we ended up having a great night which meant a lot to all of us. Highly recommend to anyone."
"Ahhh! Delicious! No words can compare, just have an appetite, you will not regret it!

Love the tiny details beginning with a nice congratulation card on the table prior to our arrival.  The girl bartender before our meal.

Our server Manon was fabulous and entertaining, our food-runner was wonderful; and let's not forget the kitchen staff Chef Kenny and Chef Chee Ping and the crew!  Keep it up!

Gene as always very attentive, thanks to all as well John Ricardo, Chef Thomas and Chef Ryan.  And if I have forgotten someone please excuse me you are reminded!

Deliciosos!"
"Summary: The opportunity exists for Hakkasan to offer a great experience along with great food. It was an important night for us and we were actually interested in the food (multicourse with wine pairing); the staff could have at least pretended to be interested instead of appearing bored. Lastly, we were charged a mandatory service charge (as is common at Fontainebleau resort), so be prepared for that. Because the food was good, I might return (for dim sum lunch) but would not go there for a special occasion.

Three friends and I visited Hakkasan and ordered the price fixed (prix fixe) multi-course experience with wine pairing (for each course). We have experienced prix fixe offerings at other multi-star restaurants and really enjoyed it. Our evening started poorly from the beginning. The seating is awkward, cramped, and very close to other diners. Our server did not identify himself to us until we questioned him. He did not offer any recommendations or orientation to the menu until we asked specifically (as we had reviewed the menu online).
After ordering the prix fixe, we did not see our server for another 20 minutes when we asked for our first wine or the opportunity to order a drink. Soon after, our first course arrived. Our server offered no information until we asked him to explain the food items and ingredients. The sommelier arrived with the first wine pairing and muttered some information and poured. I tried to engage him by informing him that it was my friend’s birthday and he barely responded at all; I just wanted to encourage him to look alive! 
The remainder of the dinner proceeded in kind. Much of the food was actually very good and enjoyable (although we had to ASK what it was). The wine pours were not overwhelming in size and the last wine was a tawny port. I really think that the server and the sommelier could have discussed/educated us about each course and wine ahead of time so we could learn something. In addition, tawny ports are loved or hated; 3 of our 4 would have gladly accepted a substitute and just left the glasses full on the table.
As an additional note, the bathroom is incredibly dark to the point that I think it’s an actual safety issue. Why??
See summary above."
Very good food! Try the shrimp with almonds and the dim sum! The cocktails were great too. And service was flawless.
"Amazing food, amazing service. Beautiful interior. Can not find one thing we did not like. 
Love love love!"
"Great fan of Hakkasan NY and London , I was expecting to have great food and great service ! We were very disappointed, the food was average and the service slow ."
"Hakkasan at FontaineBleau has an incredible Cantonese dim sum lunch...but ONLY on Saturday and Sunday ..So many delightful choices of flavors, exotic ingredients mixed with traditional and many dipping choices. Seafood, Beef, Chicken, Pork and of course All Vegtable choices are prepared just for you, so it takes a while and it is Soooo worth the wait. There are some really interesting drinks to try or hot green tea to sip while you wait, as well as soft cocktails bursting with fruit..delicious! The Chef has put together a special ""Try Me"" menu at $45.00 per person and it has several courses to desert..Awsome items on that menu, but Hubby says no to Seafood...so we chose from the menu with some help from our wonderful hostess...she was not a waitress.. she was ever present without being intrusive in any way!"
"This is a great option in Miami. 
Food is absolutely delicious; don't forget to order the dim sum, duck roll, beef with black pepper and my favorite - honey glazed sea bass.
Great service and atmosphere! Perfect night !"
"It was our second time at Hakassan Miami and again we were not disappointed. The had the tasting menu and everything was perfect! Just loved it!  The only complain was that it was too much food! We eat well but could not finish it! :-)   And our waiter, Adriano, was very very nice!  Attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, very pleasant!"
Had a wonderful dinner.  Everything was excellent the service the ambiance the music and most importantly the food.  The prices are a bit high but the portions are big enough to share so this makes it perfect for a group of friends to go together and try several different dishes. The Peking duck with pancakes is fabulous.
"It is unreal how much sugar and salt are consumed in the USA...This restaurant is situated in the famous Fountainbleau Hotel in Miami Beach. There are 12 restaurants... the place is almost a little city within a city...
The restaurant is very nicely decorated, good music and the food tasty. Unfortunately too sweet. All the dishes were loaded with sugar. ☹️️"
"Excellent absolutley fabulous ambiance and food and service was superb, expensive but worth every penny"
"Hakkasan Miami Beach is an excellent place to spend for a special occasion (date, aniversary) and the food is the best chinese food on earth or at least I ever tried also the service was excellent!. I will never forget the dessert it was the warm chocolate fondant (is a blessing from heaven) worth it for our aniversary dinner, we would recomend it to everybody 100%+."
"I can't praise this restaurant enough. My husband and i visited in July this year and were warmly welcomed by all the staff. The interior was intimate and beautifully designed. The dishes were delicious i especially enjoyed the Jasmine tea and macaroons, (first time i've ever had a macaroon!) they were beautiful and all the food was wonderfully presented. I am visiting Dubai in a fortnight and have already booked my table for Hakkasan there! I just hope it's as great as Miami !"
"We ordered cocktails, my friends martini glass was half full, when we quesyined the waiter he said it was a 6 oz. pour.  $17 !   Holy $hit.   We had 2 small plates, the short ribs and omething else unmemorabe.   We shared the sechuan chicken, it was so full of chili peppers that we could barely find the chicken, it came with no vegatables and no rice, that cosy extra.  I had heartburn unil the next day nd my frind had an irritable bowel.  Coffee was so strong we coulnt drink it.  An 18% gratuity was automaticlly added for a table of teo.  Would not recommend."
"Excellent food.  Extensive Sake menu, but all cold.  Good to go in a group so that you can try lots of dishes.  Loved the lamb and the deep fried black cod."
Amazing food. Amazing service. Daniel B was a great server. We had the taster menu which is good value and several courses. You can have wine pairing with that option. Favourite restaurant we visited on our trip.
"While being in Sout Beach you have to book Hakkasan for a dinner. The restaurant is part of a group of restaurants in London, Dubai, Shanghai and New and is housed in the Fontainebleau Resort. Excellent Kantonese food with a modern twist. Try the dim sums, crispy tenderloin and crispy duck which are mouth watering. The service is very good and you feel really treated as a guest."
"Hakkasan is a very Good choice for Asian fusion, the duck is a must, very good wine list with a decent price ratio. Service is excellent."
"What a tremendous meal! We went to Hakassan as a group of 8, and they had a great round table to comfortably fit us, without us feeling far away and disconnected. The service was great and very attentive. We chose group dining (a set menu for the price point selected), and it did not disappoint. For the $88 price point per person, we all left completely stuffed. In addition to the delicious food, they also offered an extensive wine list. All in all, a great experience!"
"I was in Miami and I had to try the Hakkasan restaurant at Fontainebleau. I booked the reservation. 
I ordered a Crispy duck and Jasmine rise. Also I tried a Jasmine ice tea and ""The Hakka"". Everything was so tasty and good. I think the food was a big portion. And I tried dessert too. The chocolate raspberry sphere. Really good. The place very nice and fancy looking. Employee very kind. Pricey place but I say was worthy."
"Food is absolutely top quality, the best dim sum I have ever had in my life! Cocktails - amazing, you will get to taste something that you have never had before! Atmosphere is just the best, staff knows entire menu inside out, will make the best suggestions for any person dining there! Astonishing drinks selection too! It's just too many good words for this pace! It's so great, must visit when in Miami beach!"
Always very good quality food and very good service. Never has been a disappointment over the last few years.
"Complete disrespect of customers time. We had a reservation for 8:30pm, asked hostess several times about our table, saw several new customers sitting ahead of us and after a tantrum, we sat at 9:50pm. Food was good, but I ask myself why we waited."
"We wanted to have a nice dinner where we could dress up and enjoy good food. My daughter is a vegan and she had tons of options here. Portions are ala carte and somewhat expensive however the food was yummy, the service was great and the atmosphere was awesome."
"My favorite restaurant. Ambient. Modern Chinese cuisine. Pipa duck,  dim sums, cod and more. Also you should try cocktails lichy martini and Hakka are amazing."
I've been coming here for years. Every time I go to Miami Beach. I only wish they'd offer me a few comes from time to time. I love the people and the whole atmosphere.
"We had the unfortunate experience of dining at Hakkasan on 10/14/16.  Our Waiter, Daniel (aka ""Danny') lacked in personality to say the least.  Not once, but 3x did he mess up my drink order.  On top of that, we asked him to split out bill evenly between our two couples at the end of the meal and he couldn't even get that right.  As a result, I ended up getting my card charged 3x. I am still waiting for those charges to be released 5 days later.  When explaining our dissatisfaction with the Manager, Tyler Macauley, he could have cared less.  He did not apologize one time for his wait -staff's repeated errors nor even engage with the discussion.  Bottom line, go to this restaurant for the over-priced food, not for the customer experience.  I will never return."
"Excellent food, great duck salad and Pipa duck. Also great scallop and mushroom appetizer.
Trendy restaurant ideal for a romantic dinner. Good service. Expensive but worth it"
"Is EXCELLENT from the begining . 
Valet Parking ??? Wonderful
Ambience ???UAU!! Very beautiful ....My 21 old daughter just spent summer in China and said that even the smell in the air is authentic . We foody family ....loooooved !!
Special thanks to Pon . She served us like we were at home at dinning room .
Recomend .....really . 
GREAT EXPERIENCE
Looking forward to come back ."
We were 2 couples that had dinner Thursday Night in Hakkasan. We definitely recommend the dim sum as a must have!!! Great Shanghai Mules also!
"This place had a lot of hype around it. Its in the Fontainebleau,one of the most well known hotels in Miami, and the prices are outrageous, so you think “its gotta be good.” 

Well, it was good, but thats it, just good. It wasn’t outstanding. The food was served family style and all had an Asain flare which me and my wife enjoyed, but it just wasn’t an OH MY GOD this is the best thing Ive ever tasted moment which is what I had expected after all the hype. 

We went to numerous really really nice restaurants in South Beach, and for the price, the quality could have been kicked up a notch. I don’t have terribly bad things to say, just that it was only “OK.""

So to summarize it:

The service is top-notch, as expected, but the food is just standard. Tasty and delicious, but not ""outstanding"" as i me and my wife would have expected."
"Visited here again after 6 months and it did not disappoint.  My wife and the other two couples had not eaten here before.  Our waiter George excellent.  The appetizers - dumplings, fried shrimp, duck salad outstanding.  For dinner the sea bass, black pepper steak, chicken all delicious.  Fried rice perfect.  My wife does not like sushi or any fish and she loved the everything she ate.  Like all food items at the hotel expensive.  We ate between 6-7pm and received a 15% discount Sunday night."
Service was spectacular our waiter George made great suggestions.  Either way if you get a reservation between six and seven save 15%.  The Seabass the best.
"Set in my favourite city (and hotel), fine dining at its best (scallops had to be see to be believed), staff were very friendly and talkative."
"Did not know what to expect but glad I went. Last restaurant to visit in the hotel and wished it was the first. Great service, food, and all must try the mango, coconut dessert. wasn't something I would usually eat but server asked that I try it. Glad I did!!!"
"Had dinner with my co-worker while at the Fontenbleu for a business conference. He was told about the restaurant, and wow, what a find! I had no idea this place was at the far reaches of the hotel.

We ordered drinks to start, his being the Negroni. I was instantly jealous and plowed mine so I could order a Negroni!. I've seen smoke used before at whiskey bars, but the presentation from Hakkasan was a first! Took this drink to a different level! You have to order this!

As for the food, they have a very modern, inventive menu that we really enjoyed. Plates are prepared and meant to share, which we did, and nothing disappointed us. We loved it all, in particular the Dim Sum platter to start. 

Highly recommend you make the journey to the back of the resort to this restaurant! 

Oh yeah, great service too!"
"We had a wonderful meal here. The dumplings were my favorite part of the dinner. The rice was also very good. Steven our server was professional, and friendly. He offered many suggestions, and they were all great. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
"Very bad experience at this restaurant for Sunday brunch. The management's handling of the issue we had is entirely unacceptable. I am very disappointed that a restaurant like Hakkosan would handle an issue as poorly as it did. We ordered cabbage dim sum (that specifically states ""v"" for vegetarian), but were served crab and shrimp dim sum. At the beginning of the brunch we specifically stated that two individuals had a shellfish allergy. Once we found a whole shrimp inside what was supposed to be a cabbage vegetarian dim sum, we called over both the server and the manager to find out what had happened. The manager of the restaurant was unwilling to help, unapologetic, and even tried to excuse the issue by saying that the server had told us that a lot of dishes have shrimp in them. We will definitely never be going back here."
"This was our first dining experience at Hakkasan. 
Pre dinner drinks at their ""waves"" bar was fun, my wife enjoyed one of their specialty martinis.
The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, although I am not a fan of tables being so close together, especially for couples (read: not particularly romantic).
We were their to try out their Miami Spice menu, and it was outstanding.  It is offered to you when you are seated, so they are obviously proud to be a Spice participant (unlike some other ""high end"" restaurants we have visited over the years which make you ask for the Spice menu. Read: cheapskate?).
Our waitress was fantastic. So was our sommelier. No push to upsell, very helpful.
Their Spice concept was very interesting. Starter, 3 entrees + rice, and desert , all family style. No real choice., the chef did that for you. And it was all excellent.
Highly recommended."
"Atmosphere is inviting. The lighting was sexy. Service was staid, not particularly friendly.  The menu was full of choices. Miami spice menu fed us with succulent morsels.  We added one appetizer and could barely finish. Each course was perfect. Will go again."
"I highly recommend this restaurant that will transport you to another place.  The service, food and drinks were excellent and I recommend you try it! It's a first class place to dine with friends, family or date night."
"We had dinner for 4 on a Sunday night at 6:45pm when the Hakkasan is not busy. Must state that the walk from the front door of the hotel lobby ti the restaurant is quite long, seemed like 2 blocks inside thw hotel plus an elevator ride to the second floor. You build up your appetite just getting there.
The decor of the room is great and seating is very comfortable. Our waiter was excellent in describing the dishes and answering our ingredient questions.
We had great rice as a side along with vegetable dumplings which we re very good, I had a steamed red snapper skin on which had no flavor ( I should have added the sauce that came with it) Howverver the Chicken, Grouper and silver cod were worth coming back for in spite of the walk. 
Our only complaint is that each of the four mains came out separately with a long wait for the last dish to come. The kitchen should be able to prepare them so they all come out at the same time. Because the kitchen was not busy the cooks timing was way off.
We would and will dine again at Hakkasan because it is good.
Also beware that the walk from the restaurant to the valet stand to pick up your car is twice the distance as getting from the lobby to the restaurant,  Not a good choice for people with difficulties walking long distances."
"Fabulous service, fabulous food! Unique blend of flavors!! Tried the Miami Spice menu. Beautiful decor. A Must try!"
"The cocktails pre dinner - fantastic 

Bar staff were great 

The crowd are great chilled everyone having an enjoyable time 

The wine list extensive and expensive but they do have somiliers to help you choose 

Steve our server was fantastic could not have done more for us 
From helping us explain the menu and his opinion of the foods to keeping our drinks topped up top class
The best I have seen all week in Miami out of all the restaurants I have been to.

Portions are a lot bigger than London, the rice and noodles especially. We went for 3 appetisers including the dim sum platter and then two main dishes, a rice and a noddles to follow which was more than we could manage. 

Overall a fantastic evening."
Must try the Lychee Martini and Chilean Sea Bass-excellent! Perfect for date night or a night out with friends.
Had my reservation done through American Express Platinum concierge. The food was amazing and our waiter was awesome. The staff were professional. Make sure to order the pecking duck it is to die for!
"We ate here the first night of our vacation at the Fontainbleau last year. I was really looking forward to it based on the menu online - everything looked tempting. But the actual experience didn't quite match up.

It's not that the food was bad - it wasn't. But it wasn't amazing, it wasn't memorable. And considering the price, I had expected at least something memorable.

The service wasn't bad either. But it was formulaic. It seemed like the kind of service you might get at a mid-level chain restaurant like California Pizza Kitchen or even Olive Garden. Quite friendly (perhaps overly friendly) but heavily scripted. To give you an idea of what I mean, we could hear our waiter say the same things, word for word, to diners at adjacent tables as he had said to us. I am used to more genuine and personal service in restaurants at this price point.

The best part of the meal was my cocktail. A year later, I don't remember what I ordered (likely something with whiskey - bourbon or rye - or gin, as those are my favorite spirits), but I know it was so good that I ordered a second."
"It pains me to write this review because the service was exceptional, but the food, in my opinion, was average at best. I would have given 2 out of 5 had it not been for that.

We decided on the Miami Spice menu. While some may argue that it is not a ""proper"" reflection of what the restaurant has to offer, I beg to differ, that it should be. It should evoke a sense of wanting to return.

Menu items consumed were the following:

Appetizer: Dim sum

Review: Average as described. Go to Tropical Chinese on SW Bird Road and try their dim sum. Then, we can talk. At about 4.25 a pop, and for the reputation of the restaurant, they should have knocked my socks off.

Main course:

Fried Rice: Below average. There are several Chinese takeout joints in Miami that can make fried rice better than what was presented. Probably around the corner from the restaurant.

Pepper steak: Tender beef, and great sauce. Was it off the charts good? No and especially for the price.

Smoked Chicken: While very tender, it seemed to me that the dish should be served hot. Yet it was not. Chicken to me needs to be served hot or at least warm to appreciate the flavor. The sauce that was made with it I did not appreciate either.

Dessert: Panna cotta and the Mango (pudding?) were good, but again, nothing to brag home about.

To conclude:

Even with the Pre-Fixe menu price (Miami Spice), I felt that we paid way too much money for, in my opinion, subpar food. I was surprised, however, because I expected so much more due to all the reviews.

Again, the service was fantastic but the food to me is a long shot compared to other local venues that I regularly go to.

For those that read and comment that I should have tried ""this"", or ""that"": I am not paying for a meal that would cost me around or above $100. Especially, when I tried what should have been a good and adequate reflection of the cooking."
"I take the same pleasure everytime I eat Hakkasan. Best ambience, food, music and service!.. Crispy duck salad, spicy pan-fried scallops, crispy prawn with mango are my favorites. Everything is just great."
Having traveled extensively in Asia and had really good and authentic food there I am super happy after my visit to Hakkasan. It is the best experience I have had with Asian food outside of Asia. Highly recommendable for anyone appreciating really good Asian food.
This restaurant has one of the best ambience and asian food in the world. Everything is delicious and all the waiters are the best. My favorite!
Excellent food and service. Antoine provided exceptional service and also provided great information on local eats and bars. Great food!!
Appetizers were great! Dinner was excellent. Portion was too small for me but none the less delicious.  Our server was impeccable and very concerned with us having a pleasurable time at dinner. Thank you Crystal very much for your service to us today
"I was here for the Miami Spice event. Dim sum lunch. The meal was delicious, tasty and well organized.The waitress was very attentive and informative ,explaining each item of the menu.Appertizer,entree  and desert all delish.Beautiful restraurant and nice ambiance.  We did not feel rushed even though it was very busy.This was truly  an extraordinary  dining experince.I would certainly recommend coming here for special occasions."
"We were there on time of the reservation. We had to STAND the 4 of us ( no seats available) for half an hour at the bar without any attention although we tried hard to order cocktails. Total mess! We finally moved to our table and order food and cocktails. From the first moment the service was with rude attitude. We order a lot of plates to taste, as always at Hakkasan, and he stops us asking again and again: Are you sure that you are going to eat all these???!!! All the time we had to try find them to order water or drinks!! it seems they avoid serving us! We've been in several Hakkasan in New York, London, L.A., Mykonos but it was the most arrogance behavior ever.They don't even say good bye to us although we gave them 20% tip for this....service! We will never be back there."
"I've been there with some friends , everyone loved it !
         They have vegetarian menu , we tried vegetarian chicken omg! I can't explain the taste . The dessert with mango I wish eat everyday kkkk !!! For sure we going to come back :)"
"Very cool Chinese restaurant in SoBe.
Good service and outstanding cuisine especially the dim sum.
Book in advance to be sure to have a good table, prices correct for this kind of restaurant."
"I came here this past week with two of my friends because we were craving Chinese food. We walked out with 175 dollar bill and it was legit the biggest waste of 175 dollars!! We got two starters, the vegetable dumplings and duck rolls. To be honest, the duck rolls were decent; however, the dumplings were not good at all.. They tasted like some thing you could buy in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  For main dishes we ordered the orange chicken, sautéed diced chicken with dried chili szechuan style and duck with kamquat sauce. The orange chicken tasted like they flavored it with orange sauce from a can.. I would not recommend this dish to anyone.  The duck with kamquat sauce was not good either. The duck was borderline over cooked and the sauce was overpowering... You would think that for 40 dollars you would get something that tastes good; however, that is not the case!!!! The sautéed diced chicken with dried chili szechuan style was the best of the three dishes.. I won't say anything bad about it since it was the only thing we thought was decent other than the duck rolls.  The restaurant is in a beautiful hotel and the ambiance is elegant and romantic but if you are looking for food that tastes good do not come here!!!!!"
Shared plate style dinning where entrees and side dishes are ordered separately. Excellent food and service. Extensive drink menu and wine and sake list.  Great for dedicating hours to just eating and enjoying the company.  Must warn that the costs are on the higher end
Hakkasan is truly head & shoulders above the rest.  Been a couple of times and never disappoints--GREAT all around.  Truly SUPERB SERVICE.  A truly extraordinary dining experience--weekends lunch great too.
"Read good reviews but it did not live up to expectations.....
1 - don't tell me what to order! Let the customer decide without feeling as though they are making a mistake
2 - I spent 16 months in China and Dim Sun should taste much much better
3 - don't be presumptuous if customers don't want dessert, we went down stairs for another drink seeing as the bill was thrown on the table before we asked for it

Poor food, poor service and a real let down."
As I said before in my review everything in the hotel is over priced and over rated nothing new here
Great meal and good staff very helpful. It's a bit expensive but worth a treat as we enjoyed the restaurant ambiance food and staff were excellent. I have been to London and New York also and this and New York are the best c
"Came to Hakkasan on a Sunday night for a nice dinner and some  fun at the Fountainebleau, we were late for our reservation so we called and spoke to Jessica, our host, which was very pleasant and held our table. A delightful experience from start to finish, we arrived and waited at the bar until our table was ready. The cocktails are mouthwatering, just perfect as aperitif for our dinner. Moved to our table and we began our great journey of flavors. Started with crispy prawns which was excellent then steam snapper, stir fried beef with shishito peppers and spicy seafood fried rice, every single dish was exquisite, we ordered family style and we continue with other dishes plus dessert, overall it's really worth the experience and service is impeccable. Will definitely  be coming back for more!!!!"
"We tried the Miami Spice Menu. The dimsum tasted all the same bland non descript flavour. Only difference: the bright artificial colors. For the Miami Spuce, there was no variety of choice ( as in José Andres Bazaar, for instance). We were served very thin slices if some meat that I thought was pork, but according to the menu, it was chicken. Some drops of sauce, impossible to know if it was good + one cherry tomato. Some very greasy and unpleasant fried rice and a very limp bok shoy. The mango mousse was very good. Perhaps it was a bad day at the kitchen, the whole hotel was awfully crowded,but i am sorry to say that the Miami Spice Brunch at Hakkasan was worse than a $ 20 meal at a chinese take out. Will never return ."
"Love dim sum! Another great find thanks to Miami spice. I try to steer clear of Fontainebleau because of the mass tourists, but hakkasan is pleasantly located in a tower on the 4th floor away from the masses.

Loved the tasting menu - my fav was the pork belly & lotus root with mushroom chicken shui Mai (although everything was delicious). The jasmine smoked chicken was good and the highlight was the homemade macarons (raspberry with chocolate, pistachio and salted caramel). 

Will be back! Very trendy and service was uber attentive and quick."
"My brother and I went to Hakkasan at the Fontainebleau to enjoy some great Asian cuisine, and we were not disappointed. We arrived a little early for our 7pm reservation so we went to the bar (which is really beautiful, the glowing blue countertop is just so pretty). Great cocktails, a bit pricey but this is Miami beach so that is to be expected. At 7pm we were seated for dinner which was divine. The duck rolls we had were nothing short of amazing. In fact, everything we ordered lived up to the hype. I highly recommend the lemon chicken, hakka noodles, and roasted chicken with spicy garlic. Definitely one of the best Asian spots in Miami for sure. Just beware of the Fontainebleau valet! 2 hour wait for our car which is unacceptable, it's much better to uber or park elsewhere in my opinion. Valet 1 star, Hakkasan 5."
"My husband and I had a late dinner here on our recent anniversary trip and is one of our new favorites. We had drinks, split the spicy Szechuan chicken, crispy orange chicken and crispy beef with orange and tangerine peel and finished with the chocolate fondant dessert. Everything was amazing, but our favorites were the crispy beef and the dessert, I would recommend both to everyone! If you are staying at the Fountainebleau you definitely need to eat here."
Excellent service and cuisine. Atmosphere lovely. Ask for Daniel B from Argentina. He will make your dining experience special!
Their Miami Spice lunch/brunch for $23 is one of the best deals going in Miami Spice Month dining.  Includes a variety of choices from their menu that gives a good idea of their menu.   Our waiter Adriano was fantastic and very helpful on explaining each item and their ingredients.
"I have been a patron of Hakkasan for several years, but now feel that their repeated degree of excellence of food and service deserve my time to write a review! We have dined at Hakkasan for a variety of reasons: business, fun, romantic celebrations, birthdays and to take advantage of their Miami Spice price fixe menus. Every single time we have gone there has been no less than perfect. We ate there last Saturday to enjoy the Miami Spice menu which does not compromise on taste or quantity! From start to finish, it was a fantastic experience...and this time our waiter, Ken, was an added pleasure. We had made a wrong decision to walk from our condo, and had gotten caught in a downpour before arriving. Ken saw that we were drenched and shivering, and quickly brought enough table napkins to reduce our chill and suggested some nice sakes to warm our insides. Ken was the perfect balance of warmth and professionalism and so enthusiastic about the food! Go there- at LEAST once!!!!"
"Classic Hakkasan. Goood food. Good vibe. Music a bit too loud. It is inside this mall called Fontainbleau (also known as an hotel). The waitress very nice and she gave us good advices on what to order. Avoid dessert. It does not go with the rest of the menu, it is nothing special and it is overpriced. Order the Dim Sum and the Udon noodles. Love them!"
"The dim sum platter was delicious, and the duck salad amazing! The decor and the music are cool. All of a supper to remember"
"On our first night in Miami we ate here. The food was absolutely amazing, the flavours were so different. The staff were extremely helpful and attentive. 

As the main courses are not cheap we decided to have two starters and share 3 main courses between 4 adults. There was plenty of food as we got rice and noodles to accompany these dishes. Our waiter did try recommend we get more food but we actually could not have eaten anymore food had we wanted to.  
The honey beef is amazing and the duck roll starters were so nice. Definitely worth the money just to experience the setting and I would recommend drinks before the meal downstairs in the reception area of the Fountainbleu as the view is beautiful."
"The menu at Hakkasan is quite extensive and the preparation is better than most Chinese restaurants.
That said, the fish is not particularly fresh.  The Florida lobster is not live, but frozen.  I have not yet been able to order Peking Duck.  On three occasions the restaurant has been ""sold out"".  Most large Chinese restaurants in NY or SF make an extraordinary effort to produce Peking duck as it is a signature and expensive dish.  Otherwise the dishes are interesting and better than average."
I stayed at  Fontainebleau this week and went to Hakkasan twice! We had a great time. Adriano was very helpful and friendly! We had the Miami spice and loved it!
"If you enjoy fine dining and culinary experiences, this restaurant is a great choice. This is definitely not your typical Chinese restaurant. Immediately when I walked in, I felt that I no longer knew where I was as the interior design is very unique. I tried the tasting menu, and it was very good. Especially, the duck was the best that I have ever had. Moreover, I usually do not like duck, but I loved it here. 

The service was good, but a bit impersonal. One reason might be that the tip was automatically added to the bill, so the servers probably did not feel that they had to work to earn it. I am hugely against adding tips automatically to the bills as it generally lowers the service levels."
Amazing weekend lunch at Hakkasan located in the Fontaineblaeu hotel. The food and atmosphere is great.
"My husband took me here for my birthday and I have to say, this may be my new go-to restaurant for special occasions. The food was phenomenal! 

I mainly eat vegetarian, but I also eat fish occasionally and this restaurant is a dream for people who prefer veggies. There are so many beautiful and interesting options. 

We started off with the mushroom lettuce wraps (vegan) and they were delectable. For the main meal, we shared the Honey Sea Bass, Bok Choy, Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) and the Hakka noodles (rice noodles with chives, oyster mushrooms and bean sprouts). All of the dishes were amazing! My husband also ordered the Roasted Duck which he cannot stop raving about. 

For the two of us, we probably ordered a bit too much food - I was stuffed at the end of the meal. Maybe one less vegetable dish or skipping the appetizer or noodles would have been better. But I don't regret it - it was a wonderful birthday meal.

We finished off with a chocolate fondant cake (it was my birthday, after all!) and it was also delicious. The cake is the size of a saucer dish, so it's a perfect small dessert to share.

All in all, a wonderful meal with lovely service - everyone there was so friendly and welcoming. We'll be back for sure . . . so I can try more of the veggie and tofu dishes!"
"The setting is beautiful, our waiter Daniel B was amazing from start to finish, advising us on what foods to order & explained the menu very well. Also very tentative which can be rare. Make sure to leave room for the Dolce Pane cotta as it is out of this world good! Can't believe this is the first Hakkasan we have been too, will most definitely be back."
The food was amazing.......and the staff was great. Beautiful restaurant on the 4th floor. Very romantic
"The food ? Fantastic.The service? Very, very nice.The atmosphere? A place to enjoy the night.I loved the drinks, really good.Our waiter was very helpful, very professional.And to close the night,a big surprise: a fantastic dessert. This restaurant worth each penny.I will come back soon."
"I am a chinese so i am real picky about chinese foods! Went there with my hubbie and kids for his birthday. 
we all loved it!!! Great foods great service and very last details in everything.
I already went to the Hakkasan in London but the portions here in Miami are bigger and the foods are better made. The London Hakkasan i found it saltier.
We had a great chardoney that the sommelier recommended, was real good! We didnt go for the tasting menus, but all our dishes were great! The din sum platter are really well made and the duck salad amazing! The honey seabass is FANTASTIC! And the veggies and the noodle were excellent too. 
The services of everyone were just great, very well attended!!! 
I would definitely go back. The price is not cheap. We paid like 400usd but just the wine was already 165$. The service of 18% already included which was really convenient!!!!

Definitely A MUST GO!!!"
"For amazing dim sum brunch come to hakkasan. Miami beach glamour at the historical and current Fontainbleu hotel is the ideal spot for a special occasion. They change their dim sum menu from time to time, so even if you go a lot, you get to experience something delicious and new every time. Just the perfect amount of food. You always leave satisfied. Great service, great location, beautiful decor and most of all authentic Cantonese dim sum. Enjoy."
"Enjoyed our dinner at Hakkasan, located in the beautiful Fontainebleau hotel. Our dinner was amazing. Loved our waiter, not pretentious at all. Very helpful as we ate things that we were unfamiliar with. Highly recommend. Pricey but worth it."
"First time at Hakkasan and we will certainly return. The meal and service were truly first class. The highlights were the Maine lobster and duck in hoisin sauce, both of which were exceptional. Together with superb cocktails the combination made this an evening to remember."
"We had lunch here for a party of 4 but don't know price because someone else in our party paid but I think it was over $100. We ordered and split one order of dimsum (they came 3 to an order and we tried to get one extra so we would all have one to try but they wanted us to order another of 3 which we did not.   

We ordered the roasted chicken with spicy garlic which was very good, a soup, a fried rice which was good and another dish that was similar to a moo goo gai pan and was fine.  We didn't order beverages, just drank tap water.

There was a table near us with probably 10 young people enjoying themselves.  They were very loud and disturbed the experience of our meal.  We did not complain though. Just thought they sort of ruined the serene atmosphere of the place."
"From the moment i walked in to the moment i left the service was great.

- Food as expected (same as london)
- Was offered complimentary macaroons not everyday in places like this you get free things.  
- Table was ready for arrival time and booking was essential but thats normal for places like this.
- Easy to locate in the hotel its situated in.

Great unique cocktails 

:-)"
"Went here with friends and had a very good meal, have a cocktail first at the bar--the lychee martini was very well received. Order plenty of food and share all around---I am a vegan and the waitress was very knowledgable about the food and had good options. We would go back again."
"Nice ambiance, we first had a drink at the bar, the bartender prepared two delicious martinis, mixing a lot of flavors, after such a good drinks, went to the table to experience a great gourmet chines dinner.  The sweet a sour pork was our favorite dish, the duck was also delicious!! We had such a great experience there!"
"Quite standard chinese plates with a touch of something ""different"" that makes them quite interesting. Excellent quality!"
"We went to this restaurant because it had fantastic reviews and we were definitely not disappointed. We had a delicious three course meal consisting of veggie dim sum, duck roll, spicy chicken, tofu claypot and the chocolate fondant. Our server was fantastic. We told him that my wife was a vegetarian who was allergic to seafood and he was really helpful giving us many recommendations. She was really happy with everything he suggested as it was delicious. The chef also decorated our dessert with a lovely congratulations message as we were on honeymoon which was a lovely touch. I would definitely recommend going here again. One of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to anywhere in the world. Great service, great decor and great food."
Perhaps it's our New York background but we were amazed when the waitress told us that food is family style sharing!  The portions were much more modest than we are use to.  Very tasty and of course expensive
"I'm not a big Chinese food fan but this place came highly recommended and as my husband loves Chinese food we thought we would give it a go.
Walking in we were pleasantly great and welcomed in. We were shown to our table and given our menus. Our waiter arrived at our table promptly and introduced himself. He was very bubbly and friendly. He offered some great vegetarian recommendations that we ordered. I was pleasantly surprised at the choice of vegetarian options they had. Our food arrived and it was once of the best Chinese meals I've had in a long while. The deco was very romantic and had a great atmosphere. The service was outstanding. The only thing that was a bit of a let down was my cocktail it was a strawberry and ginger Bellini but all you could taste was the ginger which was very bitter and overpowering.
Would definitely go here again"
"I frequently attend Hakkasan in London and love it. This one is beautifully furnished, the food is sublime and furthermore the cocktails are on a different level. A real experience and very bubbly place!"
"Food excellent, service very efficient, predictably pricey (you know that before you go)...so why quibble? It just felt impersonal and a bit of a machine - large premises and very busy, something of a name, so it's not really surprising. So while the food was indisputably good (though not memorable), the overall experience was just a little disappointing. Maybe I'm just really hard to please."
Excellent options for both carnivores and vegetarians. We chose the tofu clay pot and vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce. Daniel B provided great recommendations and a wonderful experience. The only criticism is that I wish they did not play the thumping club music.
"A dark room, wasn't very full and prices were high. Food was first class. Service was excellent. I would certainly recommend if you are staying at the Fontainebleu."
Went for dinner at 10pm on a Sunday.  The kitchen closes at 11pm.  We ordered the snapper and a chicken pasta dish with two ginger bellinis.  The waiter was very good but did point out we must not be hungry.  he Bill was $100.00 for two people.  Normal price for any good restaurant in Miami Beach.  The fish and cocktail were amazing. But the meal was very light.
"This place is pricey but worth it. By far the most authentic Asian flavours I have eaten for a long long time. The dim sum were sumptuous and melted in your mouth, the shredded beef soft and flavoursome and the duck a taste sensation. The macaroons for dessert were better than Paris. The service was spotless. This was by far the best restaurant experience in Miami."
"Wonderful menu: loved the crispy duck salad and the hakkasan noodles, the lemon chicken was a bit too sweet for my taste (glad our server Adriano steerd us away from the even sweeter orange chicken). There was a smooth operation between Adriano and his colleagues who were very pleasant and attentive. Thank you for a great night. Point of improvement would be the the atmosphere: focus on the dining experience, making it feel like a night club isn't what the food and service need in my opinion."
"We stayed in the hotel last week, we visited the restaurant every night due to the great food and service! Food very similar to London. Amazing"
"Invited 2 of our friends to Hakkasan since they had never been before. One of them had the dim sum fixed menu but we all shared anyway.

Once again we tried several dishes and all excellent.

Our waiter was outstanding, she went over all the options. Amazing experience."
"It is so nice to have delicious Chinese food in a wonderful atmosphere. The duck, eggplant were very good and the mango panna cotta was to die for. There were a wide variety of wine selection. Thank you Gene Hui for making our visit memorable!"
"I usually don't like to eat chinese food unless it's in Vancouver BC,Canada but gave Hakkasan a try since it's Michelin rated and it's in the hotel we're staying.    Definitely worth the money...food was excellent and service was great,,,thanks to Gene!!!"
"Two people, two wines by the glass, one starter and two mains nearly 200 usd. The ambient is nice, music too loud. Seems the place to go on a date, but not the one I would choose if going again with my girlfriend. Too many people trying To Be. Food is Ok."
"My absolute favorite restaurant in all of Miami. The food is super fresh and incredibly tasty. The service is excellent and the atmosphere is fantastic. Perfect experience for a night out. In high season, book in advance cause it can be hard to get a table! The Sunday brunch is excellent as well."
"Good food, but really over priced.  Most of the dishes were good, there were few that didn't really have any flavor.  The beef and seafood dishes were well prepared.  The chicken dishes were so so."
"We had the duck, foie gras dumplings, udon noodles, eggplant, beef with shashito peppers, dim sum, and mango panna cotta. Everything was delicious. No wonder this place is Michelin rated. The manager is Gene and he was wonderful. We were celebrating a 40th birthday, and Gene made sure our celebration was unforgettable."
"Dinner:  
Starters:  Vegetarian Hot and Sour Soup, and Hot and Sour Soup with Chicken
Entrees: Crispy Szechuan shredded beef tenderloin
               Prawns w/shredded walnuts
1.  Pricy entrees--but excellent
2.  Wines--way overpriced
3.  Service:  excellent
suggest 7pm sitting---will get more attention from staff

Hot and Sour Soup with Chicken"
"The food is amazing! I would highly recommend this place. Gene, the manager took great care of us. Had the best time there."
Went here with girlfriends for a night out and impressed with the high caliber of food. Thought it was going to be overpriced Chinese that would be mediocre but it turned out really good. Gene and Tim made it even more special with complimentary champagne and apps! I highly recommend this place.
Superb service from beginning to end!  The wine and food to die for!  Shout out to Gene Hui(GM) for taking care of my girls and I.
"What a delicious meal!  I would recommend this place to everyone. Not only was the food amazing, but the customer service was above and beyond. The restaurant manager, Tyler, introduced himself before we were seated.  Due to a small mix up at the hotel, we were receiving a complimentary dessert. And it was fantastic (see picture). And he made sure it was received. For dinner we had an assortment of entrees that we shared, and nothing was less than delicious. Even when I was full, I couldn't stop eating the fried rice. The Roasted Pi Pa Duck was amazing! Since we were meeting with family, we had a lot to talk about, and had been there for a while. After we finished dinner and paid, Tyler let us know there was a large party waiting for our table. We were done, so it wasn't a big deal, but to make sure there was no inconvenience, he walked us to the bar for a complimentary drink. 

Thank you, Tyler, for going above and beyond. You made a great dining experience even better."
"I decided to try Hakkasan out after reading several food critic reviews online. Reservation is a must. I did mine direct via telephone with the concierge at the hotel (I wasn't staying at the Fontainebleau.) People ahead of me that hadn't made a reservation had to wait 30-40 minutes for a table.
There isn't really a dress code which surprised me. Some people were dressed super casual, others made the effort.
My waiter was very efficient and offered suggestions. I decided on the Chicken Satay which was very good and comes with a generous serving of rice! I also had one of their mocktails which was very good.
I would return to Hakkasan again in the future."
"I have mixed feelings about this location.   Dining with them was certainly a challenge and I am not sure it was worth all of the hurdles.  My husband and I stayed in Miami Beach in October 2015.  We decided to walk from our hotel near 24th Street along the boardwalk to the Fontainebleau for their dim sum brunch at Hakkasan. 

 Even in October, Miami was in the 80s so we were a little warm after walking about 20 blocks along the boardwalk.  If you have visited Miami Beach, you may know that the hotels have gated entrances from the boardwalk side. Some even have posted guards.  When we approached the Fountainebleau (what a pretentious name spelling!!!), a khaki clad young lady stopped us from crossing into the pool area.  We kindly explained to her that we were trying to get to Hakkasan.  She would not let us enter, and suggested that we walk several more blocks north to the public access and then around the entire complex to the street side of the Fountainebleau.  

Despite being quite worn out from the sunny walk, we complied and walked north for about 5 minutes but didn't see another entrance.  At this point, I was extremely frustrated because I already knew that Hakkasan was going to cost us a pretty penny and it seemed ridiculous to me that we were having to go through all this trouble to hand the Fountainebleau our money. 

I huffed back to the Fountainbleau pool area and bypassed the khaki pants nit wit.  I went to the bar and asked a pleasant bar keep how to get to the desired restaurant.  He pointed me back to the mean girl at which point I explained that we'd already been rebuffed by her.  He understood and walked us past another set of brownshirts to the main entrance.  (the ONLY nice person we encountered in this entire stupid complex).  

After ascending to the Hakkasan floor, a tiny hostess told us we would have to wait at the bar, even though the restaurant was less than half full.  I wanted to tell her, you have no idea what we have already endured but we bit our tongue and paid for an overpriced mimosa at the bar. We overlooked quite a few empty tables.  15 minutes later, I challenged her seating plan and she said they were now ready.  She tried to squeeze us between two other tables and expected me to sit on a banquet where another guest was storing her oversized purse. 

Without hesitation, I informed her, no we were not sitting there and we wanted to sit in the empty area that we'd stared at during our wait at the bar.  She complied and we proceeded to have a very nice but outlandishly expensive dim sum meal.

Was the food good?  Yes.  Was it worth dealing with the multiple rounds of status snottiness?  Absolutely not."
"Me and some friends had dinner here last halloween, the food was good, no extraordinary, just good...
the thing is I expected more, especially because we went with a 12 course meal (I don't really remember how many courses but I remember it was a lot), and because it's inside of Fountanebleau.
I really don't like saying negative things about restaurants but because it was the first time I ever paid more than a 100 bucks for a meal I have to come up with the thruth, and essencially it'll give u nothing more than a high end chinese with a contemporary vibe
Fortunately my drink was good and the ambience was nice, unfortunately I'm not coming back"
"From the moment I walked into this restaurant, I was impressed with the chic décor and the exotic feel of the place. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Our server was on a different level of service, his efficiency and class, was one I have not experienced in a while, he was awesome! The luxury of this restaurant is present at all times, from the amazing cocktails, excellent menu, modern presentation of the food, to the delicious Cantonese cuisine. I highly recommend tasting the Dim Sum, it was exquisite. It is expensive but worth it."
"very well prepared cantonese cuisine, with a wide variety of courses to be chosen; dimsums, seafood (prawns) were excellent, spicing was delicate, and fo course, our simple but amazing favorites, eggplants. Expensive but worth the experience !"
My server Daniel B. is absolutely amazing. He's helpful and great at making recommendations. He's very attentive and never lets your cup sit dry. There menu is excellent. The food is cooked to perfection. The food is scrumptious. Although sometimes over priced based on serving size.
"We ate here for our last night in Miami and have frequented Hakasan in London (both Mayfair and Tottenham Court Road) on a number of occasions. Although the food was good and the service was exemplary, the quality doesn't compare to London if you're used to that.

The menu is similar although not exactly the same and the cocktail list has some Miami specials.

It is definitely worth a visit but just don't expect the same London standard. Someone else on tripadviser had posted this and we ignored deciding to make up our own mind. However we do agree and just something to be aware of."
"We had an amazing meal in a beautiful hotel (fontaineblue) the food is beautiful and the staff are very helpful and friendly, talking you through the menu and advising on how much to order. I had the best old fashioned (whiskey cocktail) ever. Be wanted though book ahead and be prepared for a large bill. Not cheap but very good food."
"Went here for a business dinner on a Friday night. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Earlier, we tried to change our reservation to accommodate an additional guest and were told it wasn't possible (although another guest could have easily fit at the corner booth with us). 
The restaurant is dark and pretty; a little loud for business but still enjoyable. 
The staff was attentive and helped us choose food selections for the entire table. 
The food was delicious and the large menu offered a ton of variety. They had great drinks to match."
"My waiter was excellent in the sense he heard what we were interested in that night.  Seafood and light food because we had done surf and turf the day before TWICE!!!!
The food was fresh and tasty.  The ambiance very romantic."
"The food and staff were very good.  I was a little shocked at the prices.  I travel all around the world for business, but this was a little excessive.  I think the funniest price that i remember was the $16(ish) for a tiny cup of Hot and sour soup for appetizer."
"I have been to Hakkasan numerous times in Miami and it does not disappoint,  The food is always fresh ans tasty.  The different flavors, spices and textures make it delicious.   I love the dim sum and the lobster stir fry.  The sauteed green beans are fantastic.  Tyler the GM was so accommodating and served us desert platter and white tea to end our meal."
This place is one of my favorite japanese restaurants. Love being able to come down from my room and being able to eat right away. Made reservations and was sat down quickly. Service and food was great here.
Been here before and always compare with the two in Central London. Excellent  service and top quality food. This is high end dining and wines to match. Apart from it being pretty dark all of us had an enjoyable evening.
"Great location in the legendary Fontainblue hotel! The atmosphere was super relaxed and the service outstanding! The dishes are extraordinary, I had the black pepper tenderloin, it was a dream. The sea bass and the lemon chicken were nothing else then yummy! I would come anytime again!"
"I enjoy a place like this, where you can either dress in nice casual, or dressy clothing. The atmosphere adds to the meal itself. It's a little pricy, but it's good food that is well-made, and just different enough than what you might find on other Asian-style restaurant menus, but not too adventurous, which is refreshing amid a world of chain restaurants with the same old stuff. 

A number of vegetarian options are available, which is also a valuable feature. The taro-fried rice, four vegetable side, lettuce wraps, and macaron sampler were all tasty enough for me to have to force myself to stop eating past fullness, and the fruit dessert platter was an assortment of less common fruits like dragon fruit & lychee, along with familiars like melons, pineapples & strawberries - not to be overshadowed by their Floating Goddess drink, served complete with a floatibg marigold blossom.  All good stuff!"
"A group of 4 went Saturday night. Adriano was wonderful. He recommended appetizers, main courses and desserts. All were fabulous as was the service."
"Having visited all of the Hakkasans' globally, I was extremely shocked and disappointed. We were the last sitting in the restaurant and felt very rushed in and out. The waiter was extremely impatient and just ruined the experience. I was also disappointed in a couple of the dishes. Our food was served within 5 minutes of us ordering (again a little suspect)"
"My husband and I went to Hakkasan Saturday evening for dinner. It was a last minute decision so we had a later reservation- 10:30pm. We arrived around 9:30 in hopes of maybe getting a table a little early. When we checked in with the host, they were very kind and said they would try their best to get us a table sooner. We headed to the bar, which was crowded but we were able to get 2 seats after a few minutes. The bartenders were great as were the cocktails. We were seated around 10:15. The server was fantastic and greeted us by name (I find that this rarely happens at restaurants). The food was very good, definitely between then Mr. Chow's. The atmosphere was fun and trendy but I loved that the servers and hostesses didn't have attitudes! Great experience overall!"
This is a very nice restaurant with great food.  The staff was very helpful and attentive.  The decor is very nice and the dining room is very large.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.
"Again a very good experience at the Miami Hakkasan. It does not have the stilish and more exclusive feel as the London Hanway restaurant, but still offers delicious food and excellent service. Valet Parking at Fontainebleau is easy and you receive a discount ticket at the restaurant entrance desk."
"The location is superb, tables allow privacy for everybody and service is very good. 
I had lobster and I apreciated it very much. I didn't know hakkasan restaurants before, but I think I'll visit the next one as soon as I'll have the opportunity. Don't expect classic chinese restaurant, this is a very high level cusine and very special location. I can say that it is the ""chinese version"" of the Nobu. Wine list is cheaper than in many other restaurant in South Beach."
"Definitely a fun place to try new things and interesting flavors.  Creative cocktails start the evening - the pink mojito and the green destiny were big hits. Green destiny is particularly good for those who like cucumber and green juices. The dim sum platter was a fun way to share four different flavor profiles. The green curry prawns have a little kick and were perfectly prepared - hot without being overcooked. The Szechuan beef flavorful, but could have used a little more chili spice.  The Huey sea bass was two generous chunks with a sweet bbq crust. I'd order each of them again."
"The Fontainebleau Hotel is a busy maze. The Hakkasan restaurant is like a quiet, intimate maze a world apart. Such a beautiful space, carved up into smaller areas. Very expensive, but worth the splurge at least once. Excellent dim sum and (I know this sounds odd) excellent white rice--I'm not sure what the secret is! Other dishes are interesting and well-prepared but I could take them or leave them at these prices."
"Love this restaurant i have also been to the one in Las Vegas. Modern day decor. I ordered the Dim sum platter,Crispy almond pear prawns, Stir-fried spicy lamb enjoyed every bite and the flavors. Must visit when in Miami Beach."
I took a group of 25 there for dinner.  We had something like a 7 course tasting.  The just kept coming.....  and all of it was fantastic!
"Located in the Fontainebleau, we had to make our way through the craziness of the hotel.  Lots of people having a good time but way too nutty for me.  We had early 7PM reservations so the restaurant was on the quiet side.

Interesting cocktail menu and enjoyed one at the bar before sitting down.  We were with a large party and chose a set menu.  No one raved about any specific dish.  I had to order separate due to allergies and had a clay pot dish that didn't have much flavor going on. 

Underwhelmed with food. Pleasant waitstaff, bartenders and appropriate timing of food being served. With 100's of other spots to try, this won't be one."
"Hidden in the Fontainbleau, this excellent dining experience should not be missed. Every single course was perfectly prepared and timely delivered by a wait staff who was friendly and knowledgeable."
"My daughter and I had a delicious dinner in this sleek restaurant. It was pricey, but everything we ate and drank was outstanding. I have never eaten dim sum like theirs. It was exquisite. We had a competent, pleasant waiter who earned every penny of his tip. The resort adds 18%, but we added extra, he was great!
Try the Chilean sea bass with the Thai BBQ sauce. Wow! The spicy margarita was yummy as well!"
"I had the pleasure of having Daniel B as my server at Hakkasan recently, it was my first visit and I took my 8 yr old son along with me as well. Daniel B was amazing, food was delicious and I just want to thank you again Daniel B for catering to us and making our day special. P.s. I really enjoyed the virgin cocktail I had as well!
                                        Yours Truly 
                                    Claudia Jeffries"
"Our waitress and others who worked at the restaurant were very nice in helping explaining the foods and how to eat, etc."
"This was a family meal and someone else paid, so I cannot say whether this was good value for money. Since there were 19 of us, we had a set meal. The food varied from very good to amazing, and was up to the standard of the London restaurant. 

The reason for the poor review is the ridiculously loud music that was playing all evening. It was far too loud for us to have any kind of conversation but when we asked if it could be turned down we were told that it was actually turned up every hour!  Given the prices and the quality of the food, why drown the experience in loud noise and make it impossible to talk?!"
"We were staying ay the Fontainebleau and looking for somewhere to eat. Having managed to secure a booking in Hakkasan on the first night of our visit we returned again on our last night because we enjoyed the meal so much. The only problem with the menu is when there are only two people in your party, you are necessarily restricted to the amount of dishes you can choose/eat. We wanted to try everything it all sounded so good. We chose the Spicy Prawns with Lilly bulbs and almonds which were lovely but the 'to die for' dish was the Roasted Pi Pa Duck. So good we had it twice and others were green with envy. A couple at the table next to ours had the Braised Abalone with Royal Trumpet Mushrooms and were in ecstasy. The restaurant itself has an intimate atmosphere. The wait staff are efficient and helpful and service is timely. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals on both occasions and highly recommend Hakkasan - but take some friends so you can try as many dishes as possible."
"The place is inside the Fontainbleu hotel, a chinese restaurant with a dark atmosphere. Walls are black with chinese engravings, quite suggestive. Long and interesting list of cocktails, the waiter was very helpful in guiding us through them. The crispy duck was really good, as were the curry prawns. Don't expect big portions. But you can expect a big cheque."
"2 fantastic visits to Hakkasan.  Food was fantastic.  Very expensive but worth it. Prawn and Mango starter $38, beef tenderlion entree $48. Would recommend."
"Ken was our server and provided the most AMAZING dining experience!  And I do use the work ""experience"" purposefully, as the whole evening was just that.  From the time we walked in, we were taken care of by the most professional staff I've ever experienced!  

The food was simply fabulous, and the chef accommodated special dietary needs of one our party without a second thought. 

It could not have been a better!"
"We raved about this restaurant so much that our Canadian relatives wanted to try Hakkasan when they were in town.  They loved Hakkasan. Our server and his support staff were professional and friendly.  Our water glasses were refilled automatically.  We ordered 2 dim sum platter, 1 vegetarian dim sum platter, steamed spicy red snapper, spicy lamb with bamboo shoots, roasted duck, Chinese broccoli with garlic, and spicy seafood fried rice. Each dish was well prepared, tasty, and so delicious! I already told my husband that I want to return to Hakkasan again.  I have to say that I had the best chamomile tea ever at Hakkasan. My husband and I strongly recommend Hakkasan."
"I could have eaten the duck salad every day that I was there.  Its that good.

They had the best service, I felt, in the city.  

Everything we order was exceptional.

The decor is just stunning.  The details are intricate from embroidered leather couches to floor to ceiling wall dividers."
"Having undertaken my usual rigorous pre-trip research for restaurants, I opted for Hakkasan. I was not disappointed! The restaurant is located quite far north in the Fontainebleau Hotel- so you'll need a cab (Or town car- Thanks W south beach!). Then upon arrival at the hotel- be prepared for a bit of a walk- the hotel is huge and you'll need directions to find the restaurant!. Again, I'm a fan of low lights and Asian decor- so I love the look- it's almost maze-like when you're navigating the booths/tables. Do have a cocktail before dinner- very potent! The food was fantastic and the service was sharp and without fault!"
"Nice ambiance with the exclusive feel to it. Some menu items had that Chinese take-out gooey sauce covering, which is my turn off, but the experience was lovely."
Was somewhat concerned about eating here as other restaurants in the hotel were quite overpriced for what one received.  Hakkasan was one of the best dining experiences ever.  Best Chinese food I have ever eaten and this includes multiple trips to China and Hong Kong.  Food preparation and presentation was nothing short of spectacular and the service from a Hong Kong native was just terrific.  Cannot say enough about this dining experience.  Absolutely nothing that I could think to improve upon.
"We arrived at the time of our reservation and were seated immediately. We chose the several course ""menu"" which allowed us to taste many dishes. We added one wine course to go with the menu and shared it. Yes, it's expensive but the food was excellent and the service, Daniel, even better. I would recommend this restaurant if your in the Miami Beach area."
"The food was unique and full of flavour, the environment was alluring and the service impeccable. Many thanks to our waiter, Gheorghe Pop, his services meet the highest standards !"
"Went expecting a fun, good, exciting Friday night. Had reservations and got there 45 mins early. Got a drink and mingled at the bar for a while. Asked if there was any way to sit down early. Hostess said no, then after accepting $50, told us we would be sitting in 5 mins. Sounded good until 45 minutes later and watching several people be seated before us. It put a sour note on the evening. Then the manager was condescending about the wait. He thought offering an appetizer would suffice. 
Finally ordered shezuahn chicken. Was ok until I realized that there were huge chunks of garlic in it (Which was not listed as an ingredient on the menu.) Not good for someone that gets sick by eating garlic. The other dishes were decent, but small portions and al la carte.
Overall, a complete disaster. An embarrassing evening for me in front of my guests. Not fitting for the Fontainebleau. The least they could have done is just be up front about the wait and not played the old ""5 minutes"" routine after dishonestly extorting $50 from a customer. After all that, ended up being seated 20 mins AFTER my reservation."
"I usually make reservation at this establishment at 9:00 - 9:30 pm. No availability the last time I called. Made reservation instead at 10:00 pm party of 4. We got there a bit early. They said go to the bar until your table is ready - as usual, meaning you always get your table 15 to 30 minutes later at this establishment. BUT at 10:30 pm asked status of reservation. They said 10 more minutes. At 10:45 asked status of reservation. They said almost ready Sir. At 11:15 went to host stand and told them I will not wait any longer. I was not the only one. Manger and hosts where in complete limbo. They said not our fault because of the boat show. Finally they sat us at 11:30 pm. ONE AND A HALF HOURS LATER.!!! NO APOLOGY WHAT SO EVER with rude attitude toward my guests TO SAY THE LEAST. Food is very good and that is a fact but service and customer care SUB-PAR AT BEST. RESERVATIONS HONORING SYSTEM IS NON EXISTENT!"
"Not sure how this place got such good reviews. Salt and pepper squid very salty. Red snapper wok fried too sweet. I even told my waitress that the squid was salty and no ""can I get you something else or maybe even comp half of it even though I didn't eat half of it. Very unimpressed of this place in a high end hotel. I will never be back to this establishment."
"Very interesting....last time we were here, it was an industry mega event....so many stars, and yet we were treated like royalty.  This past dining experience was on a moderately busy weekend, and yet we did not have as good of service or food as before.  Hmmmm.  We still loved the spicy margaritas and the various dishes that we ourselves ordered.   Unfortunately, our waiter must've been new to the job or very busy.  Unfortunately, he did not offer the wonderful guidance that we've come to expect at Hakkasan.  That's too bad, as it definitely clouded our review.  The waiter was not ""ready for prime time"", to put it bluntly.  Nice guy, but for these prices, we need an expert.  (Please see last review for guidance.)"
We visited this restaurant in Feb and had to return one of the main courses which was a signature dish as this was terrible. We were also served our wine before our aperitif and had to ask server not to do this. We were also served our starter whilst still having our aperitif. Maybe we were being a bit fussy but when you are paying top prices you expect to receive correct etiquette
"Hakkasan delivers great food, cocktails and atmosphere. Everything we ate was delicious, especially the chocolate fondant dessert. Its not cheap, but worth it."
"Fabulous Tasting Menu!  Wonderful Atmosphere!  Private Dining and Attentive Staff! Loved all the dishes from appetizers to desserts, highly recommend!"
"We have been to many Hakkasans restaurants... but here the food was the best we ever had. Crispy Duck Salad, Dim Sum Platter where awesome. Crispy Chicken Satay was really tender and tasty. As always ate too much... and no more room for dessert."
"Having been to the amazing Hakkasan in London, on visiting Miami Beach our expectations were high.
Regrettably from the booking process onwards the experience was not as expected, we were subjected to rudeness and arrogance from the reception staff, and waited over on hour for our booked table.
We were advised by our waiter what to order rather than left to make our own choices, which left us feeling he had some other agenda and even those did not arrive.
The food was not comparable with that of both London branches we have all often visited.
There are a wealth of fantastic restaurants in South Beach, our custom will be firmly placed elsewhere on future visits."
"Phew!! What an amazing experience. Service and energy was incredible hip.  We had 2 delicious cocktails - a  ginger mule (ginger and mint mmmmm) and a hakka with vodka, coconut, saki and the like...yum!  Then menu is attached because I would be writing forever but between the wine pairings and the food....man it was to die for.  The dumplings and the sea bass (grilled over charcoal and seasoned 
To perfection) were especially memorable.   If you choose the tasting menu with wine pairing know to go without a budget.  We ordered 4 tastings, a bottle of wine along with several bottles of sparkling water and our bill was over 1200.  Yes you read that right."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience, taking advantage of the dim sum menu. Our waiter, George, provided an excellent explanation of the items. The dumplings were incredible - best part of the meal. Our offering included a drink. Based on the high quality cocktails we enjoyed at the fountainebleau, I was very disappointed in the lousy white wine served with the meal. Overall, though, great food and service."
"Granted, Hakkasan is a very fine and trendy restaurant..

The price is on the very expensive side and the food is very tasty but not to blow your mind.
Presentation is excelent.
What is one dish not to miss is the Mango Custard. WOW!!!"
"The food is ABSOLUTELY amazing! The restaurant wins on every single point (Location, service, atmosphere, and most importantly FOOD). The menu is perfect and has a great deal of vegetarian options as well. HIGHLY Recommend when visiting Miami."
"The restaurant has a great ambiance!  The decor is impressive as it should be.  The waiter, Marcos, was really friendly, ask for him, and the food was very good.  Since i do not like Chinese food I will not be able to comment, but everyone in my table loved it.  I guess it's just one of those fancy chains with consistent food and service.  Everyone was friendly and we did have a great time!  Visiting the hotel is something not to be missed as well!"
"I have been coming to south beach Miami for nine years every February and I always eat in the best places

Hakassan is one of them
My third time 
Each year I am back
The food 
Omg I love it
Try the silver cod 
The end !
Service good
Ambiance good
Food exceptional 

Yes it's a drive for Sobe but worth it and not long in an uber

Well done Hakassan"
"We'll be back!
You must book Hakkasan

Mixed dim sum appitizer.

Braised XO seafood clay pot

Black pepper tenderloin, m/rare

Sticky rice.....

Grrreat service!!!"
"Had an evening to myself and stopped by.
As it was a Friday night it was quite busy but was happy to eat at the bar.
Bartender was great and had me try a more upscale saki that was interesting enough served cold.

I had the Crispy Duck Salad which was outstanding.

Would enjoy going back with a group of friends as the atmosphere was enticing."
"We enjoyed the black bean tofu, the fish, and the vegetable dumplings. The food was hot, fresh, and delicious."
"We originally visited Hakkasan during our first trip to Miami Beach in March 2015; we loved it, and on our return trip in January 2016, this was the restaurant that we were most excited about visiting again. 

This is a really lovely establishment. The decor is beautiful, offering a unique mix of modern with a nod to traditional Asian styling, with enough interest to keep a very large space quite intimate. Unfortunately, on this visit we were seated right across from a service station, which was busy, loud, and somewhat distracting from the romantic evening we were hoping to enjoy. 

We ordered the prix-fixe tasting menu with the wine pairing, which was what we had so fondly remembered from last year. If you've never been, Hakkasan is not your average Chinese greasy spoon down the street: it is inspired cuisine, each dish being an exquisite work of art.

The service, however, was... efficient. Unfortunately, when we are spending several hundred dollars on an upscale meal for two, efficiency is really not what we're looking for: we would have hoped for service that was warmer, a bit more personal, and less rushed. At some point, we really felt a bit as if we were inconveniencing our waitress. While serving one of our wines, the sommelier casually remarked, ""Hopefully, you won't have finished this before your next course arrives"" - we weren't quite sure whether he was accusing us of drinking too quickly (we were sipping rather than guzzling), or if he was voicing a frustration with the kitchen. Either way, shouldn't he be coordinating with the kitchen and waitstaff to figure out when to serve our wine so that we can enjoy it with our food, rather than pouring us something bubbly and telling us to hold off on enjoying it until our food gets here? 

The best service we received was from the lovely lady who graciously refilled our water glasses with a smile (and I drank a lot of water, having been admonished by the sommelier to leave the wine alone until my next course arrives!!!). When I asked her if she could please direct me to the ladies' room, she actually walked me partway to make sure that I find it without difficulty - it was a lovely gesture, and given that the restrooms were a bit out of the way, it was the level of service that one would expect of this type of establishment. 

Unfortunately, her hospitality didn't quite make up for her colleagues. Although we had originally planned to go back for a dim sum brunch, after our dinner experience, we decided to forgo it. We're still undecided as to whether we will return."
"Ate at Zuma Friday night and Hakkasan Saturday.  We've been to both places before, but on this trip Hakkasan far surpassed Zuma.  Zuma rushed service to the point we felt like our dinner experience was over in a flash.  Hakkasan timed the meal perfectly.  Our server Steven was funny and great help with our menu selections.  We definitely recommend the Pi Pa Duck and, as crazy as it sounds, the green beans!  The entire meal really was the best ever!  Thanks to manager Tyler for his multiple visits to our table to ensure a great evening!"
"Hakasan is a unique dining experience
The atmosphere is high class Chinese
So we're many of our fellow diners
This is a place to dress up and enjoy being pampered and seen
The food is exquisite, and we have been to China several times
The only concern is price. Be ready to spend $150 or more Per person."
"had dinner there tonight.  I would only do this if you like greasy fatty taste free Asian cuisine. 
Honestly surprised at how poor the food was. 
Staff was good on the way in.  Not so much on the way out.
 Decor is okay if you like to feel like you are counting money in an 18th century bank. 
Make up your own mind but after having heard much about this place I was at a minimum disappointed. 
Fontainebleau  forever!"
Fab bar with excellent cocktails - you must try the smokey old fashion; not only is the preparation pure entertainment but it's absolutely wonderful. Great vibe with excellent service dishing out delicious food course after course. Try the tasting menu! Great wine list as well.  The only disappointment...the bill.
"Our experience was wonderful. While everything tasted wonderful, the bok choy and the chocolate lava cake were out of this world spectacular. The service was impeccable. Also try the Liccthi martini! Be forewarned though that when they mean family style dining- they mean it! We definitely ordered too much food. What a great restaurant!"
"Excellent food and service. Not typical Chinese food; authentic dishes. We were a group of 8 and ordered numerous dishes to share. Prior to being seated, we ordered drinks at the bar. Friendly staff all around. With Chinese New Year two days later, we were treated to Dragon dancers."
I was with my wife for dinner. They serve a first class seafood for the right price. The atmosphere is very nice and very charming. The quality of food is worth the visit. I definitely will return.
"I could just cry!  I had leftovers from my amazing dinner and left them in the hotel lobby when I left for the airport!! My mouth has been watering ever since I realized I had lost them forever, or at least until I return to Miami.
I never go to Miami without eating her, at least once.  They serve Asian Fusion.  The entire experience never disappoints from any perspective.  There are walls up all around the restaurant, although they are wooden cutouts of asian designs that you can see through, no matter where you sit, you feel like you are in a private area.  
The food is phenomenal!  I get the same thing every single time, although we all try everyone's meals.
Their crispy orange chicken is ridiculous!  I even asked for the recipe for the orange sauce, they gave it to me and I was able to reproduce it exactly!
Cocktails are crazy good and it is set up with a la carte sides, so you can always share!  The chicken vermicelli with fresh bean sprouts is amazing.  I have been with people who have ordered the chilean seabass which has always gotten rave reviews as well.
I can tell you that when I go away alone, I treat myself to great meals and the night before, I went to the J & G Grill in the ST REGIS hotel.  It was twice as expensive, half the food and only 1/10th the quality (review to follow)
At Hakkasan, every meal is exactly reproduced down to the finest detail every time I go,
It is always guaranteed to please.
Oh, and I almost forgot, service has always been amazing as well. Crystal took care of me this time.  The entire wait staff is very familiar with the ingredients in case of allergy, are very nice and attentive while not being overbearing!  If someone is walking by, even if they are not taking care of your table, and sees somethigh that can be cleared, they will offer to do so for you!!!
I could go on and on and on, but then you won't be able to get off your computer and go experience it for yourself!!!!
Bon Apetitie!!!
Ok, last words. I promise.  They do have very private larger tables for bigger groups AND a huge balcony for you to go out and view the ocean, sunset and gorgeous grounds of the Fountainbleu in which the restaurant resides!!!"
We Celebrated New Years Eve in Hakkasan!  The place is Amazing!   Great atmosphere and delicious food.  Service is superb.  Definitely worth a visit!   Reservations are a must!
We celebrated New Years Eve in Hakkasan!  The menu is excellent!  The service is superb!  Very romantic restaurant!  The appetizers were very good (Vegetable Dumplings).  The place is Amazing!  Great atmosphere!
"Celebrated Chinese New Year @ Hakkasan...fabulous food & service!  Tyler & Bon were wonderful.  Best meal/service so far!  
Sara & Sue"
"First time at the Miami Hakkasan, although have been to the one in San Francisco many times and loved it. The Miami one was very good, not quite as exceptional as its sister, but sometimes it's just what you order, so will hold off. Service was very good, the appetizers were excellent (their signature duck salad and vegetable dumplings), but the entrees were too greasy, all of them (spicy lamb, Hakkasan noodles and a chicken dish whose name I can't recall because they replaced the prawn dish I originally ordered but was returned because even though the quality of the prawns was excellent, it was tasteless and bland). I would certainly go back. It's a very expensive way to have Chinese, and when they do it right, it's awesome. This one experience less so, but their great reputation deserves another visit."
"Don't believe the hype!! It's overrated and over officious .

Very average meal at $100 a piece plus for 4 people / two courses plus 18% service charge.

Confirmed two of our party where gluten free when we made the booking and was told they could cater for us cooking with tamari soy sauce then given a very restricted  menu when we arrived of mostly steamed dishes!

Then tried to use my debit card to pay the bill but was told since it was a UK card they couldn't swipe it (apparently they don't do chip and pin either ) ; and that they wouldn't let me call the debit card company on their phone to clear the transaction as it was international call

Was advised to walk to an ATM  withdraw cash whilst the rest of my party had to stay in the restaurant which was very embarrassing. Did so but the hotel ATM only dispensed max $200 so we had to get my daughter to bring cash from our hotel at Bal Harbour before we were allowed to leave 

We had enough cash between us to pay all but $40 of the bill but they would not accept any surety even for this amount till we could return the next day or payment over the phone by my PA from a different  credit card for the $40!

Disgraceful service that ruined our evening"
"This place is amazing. I found this restaurant (ambiance, quality of food and service) one of the best I have seen in my life. Being vegetarian, they had so many choices which I have not seen anywhere else. This place is not cheap but it is WORTH every penny. If you are in Miami Beach area, please take the trouble to have a dinner at this place. You will not regret my recommendations. In my view, having eaten Chinese food at various places, this restaurant exceeds my expectation by far."
"We enjoyed our dinner here! Great atmosphere and delicious food. Our waiter was very nice, and attentive. A little to talkative and over the top, but still very good.  Definitely worth a visit."
I am really not chinese food lover but Hakkasan is the exception. Dim is 100 %  recommend ( mango custard is amazing).Excellent atmosphere and service 5 starts.
"Given the location of the restaurant, it isn't surprising that the place is expensive. The food, service and ambiance is excellent. The dim sum was exotic and tasty. The beef tenderloin and noodle dishes were also excellent."
"I have eaten at Hakkasan more than 10 times and usually in small groups of 6 or less. We had almost 30 people for a business dinner/celebration. The manager assigned us to a room in the back where we had the complete room up to the last few minutes. The food is exceptional and so was the service, considering the number of people being served. Everyone was able to offer off the menu, rare for a party of that size. We have never been disappointed with quality of food and service. Last night was no exception. I highly recommend this restaurant for all occasions and all size parties."
We are fans of Hakkasan London and Vegas so wasn't disappointed in Miami.  Food amazing but pricey.  Cocktails to die for and friendly staff. Recommend the duck salad but disappointed no half Peking duck and didn't want to pay over 100 bucks for a whole one.  Delightful meal as always and beautiful decor.
"So glad I wasn't paying the bill!  This was a lovely meal, with great service and good food.  We ordered many different dishes -- the peking duck was great, but I'd skip the caviar -- just didn't add to the dish.  Salt and pepper squid -- great! Asparagus and lotus root - wonderful!"
Excellent dim sum and beautiful décor.  The restaurant is in the Fontainebleau hotel and has a very large bar area.  Reservations are a must as its busy all the time.  Service was great and the food delicious.
"My wife and I have eaten at Hakkasan London and New York as well as Miami. We returned for an anniversary dinner and had the Best of Hakkasan. Every course was a delight. Our waiter, Daniel, and the manager Tyler were attentive and not overbearing. We left to remember the end of a great day with an outstanding meal."
We returned to Hakkasan with two friends who have not been there yet. The atmosphere is still very trendy and stylish. The food is spicy but not too much and the service efficient. The only disadvantage is that it's really an expensive place. Anyhow we left the place content and not hungry at all.
"Being a big fan of Hakkasan London, my husband and I decided to eat at Hakkasan in Miami beach. Nothing was fresh, everything was pre-prepared from days ago. We ordered dumplings, lily bud asparagus and veggie garlic fried rice - all super stale. My husband and I both had the worst stomach aches from it. Would not recommend any one to go there."
"Love the food,interior , deserts, champagne cocktails  ! Super warm and sophisticated welcome !This restaurant is gorgeous inside -out!! Simply the BEST!!"
Great ambience. Attentive service. Truly gourmet. We had the chef choice menu. Everything we had was delicious. My favorites: the pecking duck and their molten cake for dessert. It's the best we've had.
"So being a Californian from New York, I give my disclaimer that if you're from Cali, where there's an abundance of authentic and delicious dim sum everywhere you turn, you will find this to be a 3-4 star on the food, at 2-3x the price of California - it's fusion, and there isn't the delicate handiwork on each item like there is at places like Din Tai Fung.  But if you're from New York/East Coast, where our notion of dim sum is ""something around this price range even in Chinatown"" for oily, greasy, noisy, and well... dumplings - this is a solid 5 and way better than what we got back home.  

Beautiful decor and lovely ambiance, the service is fantastic and the dim sum is clean, light, and tasty.  You get 3x pieces per order, and the size of these dim sum items are larger than usual.  And compared to NY prices... dim sum here is a steal!  I chose to order a la carte, and would highly recommend the duck pumpkin puff, and  the scallop sui mai.  We got all the other dumplings too, and I would say they're all tasty, though the vegetarian ones were less so if you're not vegetarian.  And I can't believe they serve porridge here too for brunch - love it!  Brunch at Hakkasan will definitely be a staple for us next time we escape the cold from NY!"
"I would definitely eat here again. The atmosphere is very cool, and although the food is sharing style, it is amazing."
"As in London, it is a bit noise.
But the food is excellent.
Try the dumplings, and the pork belly.
If you are staying in this hotel (Fontainebleau), it is a good option for Chinese cuisine.
The other good Chinese restaurant is Mr. Chow."
"We've dined at Hakkasan as often as possible, usually on Sunday's for the Dim Sum but this past weekend everything we ordered surpassed our previous visits. Everything was delicious!"
"via business relations I was in the Fontainebleau hotel, Hakkasan seems to be a must do experience. First days we looked at it, but it's very expensive. In the end decided to do it and it was an absolute fantastic food menu. 
If it's worthwhile the dollars compared to nice 3 star michelin restaurant for a simular budget... not sure.
It was nice, but i'm not going back a 2nd time."
"Crispy Duck salad was fantastic, dim sum
Was as well, stir fry prawns with pineapple were cooked to Perfection, fair prices and great service and ambience."
"Group of 15 of us ate here on a Sturday night in a private room, very good and great service from the staff. Food was typical Hakkasan, brilliant as usual, duck salad always top choice!!
Not so buzzy an atmosphere in a private room, but good on them for offering the full a la carte menu for a big group on a Saturday night, not many places will do that, in fact very little. Definitely worth a visit, not cheap but in my opinion, value for money!!"
"From the dumplings, to all the main dishes this was an exceptional meal. The beef tenderloin was a standout, as were prawns and the noodles."
"Visited this lovely restaurant few days ago whilst in Miami, great atmosphere, menu different from that of UK, tastier,  more imaginative, more creative and much larger portions!!!! Buzzy atmosphere, great service as always, waiters hands on and very enthusiastic. Would definitely come back."
"Worth every penny, the Chinese food here was just as good as I remembered from London. Every single dish was to die for: example, the green beans were the most tender, fresh, perfectly prepared I think I've ever had and in general, vegetables are not usually the first thing you rave about in a restaurant. Memorable food.  Drinks are also delicious. Service was attentive but unobstrusive. Our oval table in a semi-private niche was lushly decorated and felt so special.  A night to remember.  The only drag is the long walk through this annoyingly trendy hotel from the valet.  Everything else was perfect."
"Went here with a college and his wife for dinner. I had a great bottle of red wine from South Africa which I'd taken with me on the trip. 

Dinner was a real treat. Having been to the Hakkasan in London, this lived up to the name.

We tried different dishes recommended by the waitress and they were all excellent and tasty.

Definitely worth a try if you looking for high quality and something different."
"Been to several Hakkasan's throughout the world and this one holds up to the standard.  Ken, our server, was awesome.  Made my wife, kids and I very comfortable."
"Upon arriving, hostesses were courteous and led us to our table. 
Even though we did not have a reservation and restaurant was packed, there was a table available for us. 
Ambient music was perfect and reminiscent of chillstep. The restaurant is beautiful and meal felt intimate, even if there was another table a few feet from ours.
Cocktails were absolutely amazing. Definitely not like other bars or restaurants. I recommend the Strawberry basil martini - a truly perfect mixed drink.
We had the Black Pepper Beef Tenderloin, Pan-fried Wagyu and Taro root fried rice. Meat temperatures were exactly as ordered, beautifully plated and meat quality was superb. 
Since it was my birthday, I was surprised with an assortment of desserts and was absolutely impressed with the quality of service that Adriano provided us. 
Will definitely recommend and go back. Not to mention, we will be asking to be seated at Adriano's and his teammate's table / section."
Great ambience good food loving their Dim Sum and soup dishes especially the Hot And Sour soup. Only find it a trifle too expensive for basically good Cantonese food.
"My first Hakkasan that I've visited, was the original one at Hanway Place in London. So whenever I dine at Hakkasan in other parts of the world, I compare it to the above mentioned. I am satisfied with Hakkasan Miami as it provided us with a good service and food. My favorites remain to be the duck salad, mushroom stir-fry, peking duck. To my surprise, the restaurant ran out of green tea. Other than that we had a great dining experience. The atmosphere is excellent, less hectic than Mayfair and Hanway Pl."
It was a bit of an effort to get a table.  We were not aware of the popularity prior to arrival.  Jessica managed to 'squeeze' us in and it was perfect.  She was kind to us and clearly going places with her professional demeanor.  The Pipa duck was at the best.  The atmosphere is modern elegant with a beautiful bar that you can dine at as well.  They do not take walk ins so remember to reserve in advance but its worth it.  Yum
"This was our first trip to the Fountain Bleau and definitely not our last. As a person with a ton of dietary restrictions I'm always apprehensive about eating out, especially at non specialty restaurants, but Hakkasan has options for everyone. 
We came in and were greeted by friendly hostesses and quickly led to our table. The ambiance is great, this spot is super trendy and beautiful.  

Our server was Daniel, and I really can't say enough about how great he was. He was super accommodating and personable.
We were with a family member who's gluten free and my husband and I are vegan, so following what everyone at the table can and can't eat is a challenge for anyone. Daniel gave us the whole run down of the menu, what we can and can't have and how things could be modified and made sure everyone was satisfied throughout the meal.

The food was insane. So delicious, every dish was well thought out. We had the dumplings and lettuce wraps to start, they were so flavorful and the portions were generous. My husband and I shared the vegetarian chicken, green beans and a noodle dish. Everything was so good, and even a non vegan/vegetarian would not know the difference between that chicken and regular chicken, I'd never experienced that before and I know I'll be craving it even when I'm hundreds of miles away back in Philadelphia. The beans and noodles were also delicious.

For an upscale restaurant the pricing is pretty reasonable. 4 people ate and drank for about $250.

This is definitely a place we will be visiting again on our next trip to Miami."
"The atmosphere is dark (old Chinese) but the decor is distinctive and the music is what we labeled ""new age Chinese.""  The meal was delightful!  If you can get Bon as your server, then you have found the best.  She was great - personable and helpful - she offered superb recommendations.  We had the crispy yellowtail, and it was amazing!  Do NOT pass up dessert.  The mango mousse/custard was served with calamasi and dehydrated pineapple.  It was unique and exotic - out of this world.  The tea is authentic, and served in a pot.  We had individual selections, but one would have been sufficient for both of us.  The dining experience was extraordinary and exquisite, largely thanks to Bon!  Make reservations!  Bon appetit!"
"This place is amazing. I loved the ambiance and food. The wait staff is on point. We started with dim sum platter, and it was excellent. Also we ordered the y c fried rice (special fried rice) and orange chicken, and beef tenderloin. I loved the beef tenderloin. It was perfect! I wish we saved room for desert. Bill came to $250 for two of us. Wine by glass is expensive...about $20 per glass. Worth the fancy ambiance and delicious food!"
"We (a family of 4) had dinner at Hakkasan 2 days before Christmas.  The venue is very nicely decorated and ambience is good.  For all we have ordered, all the dishes were great and authentic Chinese cuisine.  Although the price is high compared to other cities but not out of line given the high costs of living in Miami.

The service was great in the beginning but sort of weak later on that eveing as more customers showed up.  Overall, we still rate this restaurant very high for Chinese cuisine.  

Their location is a bit further north from where the actions are but we found that you can get around Miami area very easily with Uber service.  Their price perhaps is the only thing that is cheaper than everything else in south Miami."
"As a experienced Chinese cuisine taster, the flavor of this restaurant is just so so. Volume is on the lower edge. Very over priced.  We ordered take out but was enforced to pay 18% tips. What a robbery. Will never come back."
Food is excellent! Would definitely come back!  Service was great.  Great to share dishes with your dinning companions.  Really enjoyed the food!
"Visited Hakkasan for dimsum on a sunday. The best dim sum I have ever had and I have tasted many from many countries .  The baby bok choy  is amazing, the peking duck unbelievable , everything was so delicious . I will visit on every Miami trip. Trendy and modern ."
"Every detail of this place was amazing. The environment and decor was fantastic, the service was impeccable, and the food unique and full of flavor. I cannot recommend this place more."
"Food is amazing. The dim sum appetizer is the best I've had since relocating to Florida from NYC. We had the Sha Cha Chilean Sea Bass, Spicy Scallops,  and gai lai which were delicious. My husband loved the sea bsss. We had the chocolate ganache for dessert which was just okay. The service was on spot and the decor was nice."
"Not only is Hakkasan which is situated in the Fontainebleau Hotel a great food experience and beautifully designed, but the wait staff we had, George, was gracious and knowledgeable. When he was asked about gluten less foods he immediately was able to analyze the menu and make great recommendations. We ordered the almond crusted prawn, each of which was very large, the scallion rice and the honey glazed Chilean sea bass. Everything was perfectly prepared and professionally served. We give it 5/5."
"Try the Peking duck and as many other items as you can.  Order things to share around the table, you won't be disappointed!"
"There are so many culinary choices on this menu, that is makes it hard to choose! The waiters are very helpful with your decision making process. The food is complex and delicious. We eat here every time that we are in Miami Beach."
"...for an amazing attack on your tastebuds. Where to begin...the dumplings were outstanding, the tenderloin melted in your mouth, and the tofu (I'm not a tofu guy) was great. There are no words to adequately describe the duck."
"We were there on a group business dinner where we had a pre fixe meal with wine pairings. We had three dishes for the first course served family style including the dim sum and house salad. Then on to our second course which ranged from scallops, grouper, beef, chicken, bok choy, rice, shrimp. We wrapped up with a delicious desert. We were fortunate to have the executive chef stop by and explain every dish. The food, service and overall experience was outstanding."
I was so looking forward the this place ! The server was very nice and attentive but the food really let me down . I was not impressed in the least bit . I was quite disappointed and feel like all the talk and ratings are highly overrated just because of its location . Nice staff .
"We were kept waiting for one hour having had our hotel concierge book a table. On arriving at the Fontainebleau just finding Hakkasan was quite amusing...we ended up in odd winding corridors via a lift from the basement but we eventually got there.

Yes, it was oh so cool, with tables full of Russians being very flashy.

A ridiculous restaurant with bad service, so-so food but worth it to have a laugh at the multitude of posing spots outdoors by the pool and the various cabanas."
Superb service and Perfect menu choies. We enjoyed ouer dinner there very much. If You like Chineese cuisine this is the Place.
Found a great table with friends private cozy but in the middle of the action food was outstanding although I recommend staggering your courses as to not over eat. Hip and interesting crowd
"The food was very good, especially the dim sums. The mango custard dessert was a delight. Nice environment and very good service, although the food took a little while to come. Overall, it was a very good experience."
"The service was AMAZING, food was out of this world. The presentation was amazing  on everything. The waiters wine selection was right par with the meal.  Going back in a month when we are down in South Beach again!!!"
"I love this place, its a little noisy for me but good food and my friend love going there. A few months ago a great friend who loves his food ordered the whole menu. So I guess I have a good basic knowledge and will return."
"If I were coming here for a light dinner and drinks this would be the place. Great atmosphere and service. However I would not recommend coming here when you're hungry and craving a large meal:

Pros:

-I've never had a flatter stomach the day after a Thanksgiving meal in 25 years 
-Service was on point
-Orange chicken and scallops were to die for 

Cons:
- Portions were too small"
"Very cool bar. Food excellent. Great atmosphere. Dined with our teenage kids (19 & 16), who loved the whole experience. Quite expensive but that was to be expected."
"First time and coming back, as this is the best for Miami Beach! We loved the Service, from the pre and post dinner cocktails, to dinner!!"
"The restaurant is hidden in the Fontainebleau Hotel - which is a gigantic place. The decor is stunning, with a waterfall at the bar and wooden ""see through"" walls (w oriental design) separating tables. Romantic. The food is good we were hoping to find more Szechuan type dishes. Good wine list. We would go again."
Had an amazing meal at the restaurant with amazing cocktails and great atmosphere. The food was so tasty and the staff were really attentive really enjoyed it and I liked the fact it was in our hotel so it was easy to get to!!!
"We went with a large group so we ordered an assortment of appetizers and entrees. Everything was fabulous: Eggplant, dumplings, short ribs, sea bass and so much more that I'm forgetting. A bit on the pricey side but the food was very good."
Great place to satiate your taste buds if you are fond of Chinese aka Cantonese food. The restaurant has a great menu and fabulous food.Enjoyed the most
"friendly staff, good vibe in restaurant, the food was great - we were a large party and were seated right away and had great service."
"We visited this restaurant on our honeymoon. Service was excellent & the food was beautiful, expensive but worth every penny."
We asked our waiter for his suggestions and he was spot on with the more popular items on the menu. It was expensive but worth every bite.
"Everything great - as always, but not as fantastic as either of the London restaurants.

Really annoying being made to settle the bill at the bar before going to the table.  Is that just being lazy?

Quick Fix: The bar surface needs mending and the tables need replacing everywhere."
"I took my wife there for her birthday. She is a connoisseur of Chinese food. We both felt The food was authentic and very flavorful! The service was was impeccable. Julia and her team served us seamlessly and the pace was just right. The dumplings appetizer was to die for. Everything was great but I would get rid of the ""Techno music"""
"Hakkasan is always a favourite with me and the Miami branch is no exception. With excellent, thoughtful service (thank you Daniel) and a non-fussy menu, it's a refreshing change to not have 1,000 different food options, unlike many other establishments.

You simply HAVE TO try the roast chicken with spicy garlic. It's like nothing you've ever had before, or will again. We came back a second time, and had orange chicken and black pepper steak, both fantastic too and probably our best meals during our stay.

Best of all, the restaurant is family friendly, so we could take our little baby along, which was so nice."
"These guys provided an exceptional service with oustanding drinks. 

Very friendly bartenders and the manager. Thank you for making our night special."
"The food is exquisite, the ambiance warm and contemporary, the staff very polite and knowledgeable.
We were seated right away at a table, but then requested to be relocated to a booth and the manager promptly accommodated us.
I ordered the roasted duck with kumquat sauce, and it was the best I've ever had- full of flavor and slightly crispy on the outside.
Truly professional food and service, I'd highly recommend Hakkasan to anyone."
"We visited Hakkasan for dim sum brunch on a beautiful Sunday. Georghe was our waiter - had seen a good review that mentioned him and he did not disappoint. He was knowledgeable, and friendly - made excellent suggestions. He and other wait staff were attentive without being overbearing. Perfect. The dim sum was delicious, jasmine ribs were to die for. Bok Choy was sautéed just right. My teenage son was still bit hungry so we did order a little extra. Finished with mango custard and white tea with honey - awesome! Only complaint would be that the items come out sporadically - which Georghe apologized for. Some plates too fast - others slow. All in all very good - we had a great meal. Only giving 4 stars due to the timing of the food coming to the table. Definitely recommend."
I've been to this Hakkasan several times now and It never fails to provide fantastic food with great ambiance (hip and cool).  The dim sum platter and the duck salad are my favorite.  It's located inside the legendary Fontainebleau Hotel.
"I stopped by Hakkasan for a solo dinner and ate at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and gave excellent service. I ordered the dim sum platter as an appetizer which was very good. The scallop siu mai was good, the shrimp har gao was very good, the crab and chive dumpling and the vegetable dumpling were excellent. I couldn't decide between two entrées, so I ordered both the lobster with XO sauce and the black pepper tenderloin. Both entrées were served at the same time, the lobster was piping hot, great, but the tenderloin was lukewarm/cool, not so great. The lobster was high quality but the XO sauce was bland and not plentiful. The tenderloin was similarly very tender but the black pepper sauce underwhelming as well as tepid. Presentation was nice for both. The bill with gratuity was nearly $200, which I certainly have no problem with if the food is of outstanding quality. However, although the dim sum was worth the Miami Beach premium, neither the lobster nor the tenderloin were worth the price of admission. It is possible that other main dishes exhibit more authentic flavor, but the two I sampled were good but certainly nothing special. The service was, however, friendly and attentive."
"Amazing food. Perfect recommendations by the wait staff. Had the Wagyu beef, with a side of french beans, beautiful red wine, mango custard and grappa for desert. Highly recommended."
We booked a table in this restaurant as we were staying in the Hotel Fontainbleu where it is located. We were not disappointed the waiter was extremely helpful with the menu and helped us choose our dishes. The dishes are cooked fresh and served Asian style with a bowl and chopsticks ( you can have silverware though) . The quality of the food was superb and would highly recommend this restaurant but be aware it is expensive $200 for two of us with one glass of wine each!!! The ambience is dark and romantic and the service was what you would expect .
"I tend to answer yes, though I haven't visited them all....However...this one is pretty nice...tucked away in the Fountainebleua Hotel, entering the hotel is like getting into a different world. The food - as always - is fantastic...though I am still a bit shocked, they took the shrimp with wheat flakes (one of their best dishes) from the menu. But....the crispy duck salad is still there and will make me come back again and again :-)"
"Took friends to enjoy the afternoon on the beach. Stopped in for a bite and the food was good. The salads & sandwiches we had were fresh and the drinks were cold. Ok we enjoyed the drinks more than the food. A good place but being a local not a spot for us, tourist seemed to be having fun though....."
"We went to the Hakkasan with very high expectations so many of our friends reccomended us the restaurant! 
The food was great really great! 
Good job to the kitchen 
Now, our tabel was not ready at the time we reserved it that is not acceptable! 
After we really enjoyed our starter, they cleaned the table and voila the main dish was already there way toooo fast we went there for dinner and not an business lunch. 
Same after the main dish the waiter asked us if we want desert and coffee we told him maybe later we want to finsh our bottle of wine and then have coffee and maybe desert. He brought us the bill which was not ok. 

For such a famous restaurant with this prices are we not used to get kicked out i am sorry would never return!"
"Everything that arrived at our table was beyond delicious. dim sum were unbelievable. Scallops were exquisite. corn and crab chowder couldn't have been better. Wow! And our server, Julianna, was the best: warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. She was a total sweetheart. Perfect server for a perfect meal."
I love hakkasan and this trip certainly did not disappoint!!!! Love the location of this restaurant it is in the famous Fontaine bleu restaurant so we decided to go to LIV right after as it was a Sunday night and diddy was hosting. The portions are incredible and I believe it is actually cheaper than the London ones which I have dined at several times because our bill including cocktails was about £45 each this is so reasonable! Love love love
"Hakkasan is a very nice Chinese restaurant tucked away on the 4th floor of the Miami Beach Fontainebleau hotel.   I came as part of a customer appreciation dinner sponsored by one of our large business partners.    We had a mixed table of 12 different people and were given a nice corner table.   The wines served matched our food well and were of very good quality.   We choose a multi-course option, which started with shrimp prepared 3 different ways.   The next course was duck served with sauce, wrappers, and veggies so that you could roll your own creation.   Other courses of lobster, mahi mahi, and pork ribs followed.  All of the food was well prepared and delicious.   I had to leave early to drive home, so I missed the end of the meal, but I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in the Miami Beach area.   With the restaurant up on the 4th floor, its isolated from the other activities going on at the hotel."
"Our server, a wonderful blonde in a red dress, was superb.  It was a music industry evening, but we were still treated like stars, even though we were not!  Excellent food and service.  Everything our server recommended was spot on, and we could not have been happier.  Crispy duck salad and mushroom wraps were to die for!  Yum.  Our entrees were spectacular, and loved doing both a ""surf"" and a ""turf"" to balance it out.  Fried taro rice rounded out a terrific meal.  Our coconut sorbet and mango dessert topped off the evening.  Great wine selections and honest pours.  What more could you ask for?!  We loved the London restaurant, and this one came through as well."
"We sat at the bar because there were no tables available but the service was amazing, the staff was great, funny the food... no complaints what so ever, it was delicious.  The atmosphere was relaxing and enjoyable.  If you stay at FB you must go to this restaurant."
"Excellent business dinner at Hakkasan in the Fountainebleu Miami. We had a tasting menu that ticked all the boxes for both those in the know relative to oriental cuisine to a novice. Buzzing and killer cocktails what I did find interesting, although not unpleasant, was the background music being funky club tracks. Well, it is the Foutainebleau. Been to the one in London and clearly this brand is consistently excellent no matter where you dine."
"It has the typical Hakkasan design: dark interiors and shifting light displays.  However, having dined in the Hakkasans in London and Las Vegas, this was by far our best culinary experience yet in the chain.  The spare ribs were so well made they literally melted in your mouth.  We had the red snapper two ways - broiled and baked - and both were fantastic. The dim sum was to die for.  And the portions were sizable rather than the usual modest Oriental-fusion-restaurant fare.  This is Hakkasan comes highly recommended.  It helps of course that it is also located in the lovely Fountainbleu hotel, one of Miami's finest"
"This place offers delicious asian food.  The ambience is dark and romantic.  Although the food is outstanding, it is also very expensive.  Nonetheless, great option for Chinese food in Fountainbleu Hotel."
"very special combined Amerasian styles. 
service was excellence. 
wine was good. 
family oriented.
a very special chinese restaurant"
"Hakkasan restaurant in Fountain blue hotel has awesome food and great service. The ambiance is good. Even though they ask for reservations, walk-ins are also well taken care of in no time. My husband and I liked the food and we went twice there to try other options. The desert - mango custard was really good.
It's a must go and we would go there again  when we visit."
"Hakkasan is out favorite restoranon this visit.we have eaten here twice before and loved it however , this time they out did themselves .ther waiter ,I think his name is mark  , was great"
"Our dining experience was a pleaure!!! The food was sublime!!! Our server and the manager were polite, engaged and professional. The hostess made us wait when we had a reservation (annoying) and tried to make us wait in the bar.  We didn't appreciate this. The decor is pretty, but dark. Love Asian decor, but it would be mind-blowing if the Fountainbleau opened up the space and leveraged the ocean front location. There are no world class restaurants on the beach that have a view!!! Why not???"
"The food, the ambiance, the service: we had a fantastic meal and experience! Definitely recommend this restaurant!!!"
"The food was great, the service amazing and the special attention from Irina made this experience unforgettable!!! Highly recommended"
"We went there for dinner and we loved it. We took the Miami spice menu so was a great value. It was so good that we ordered more dishes from the a la carte menu. The tilapia was impressive and I love the fried vermicelli. 
The service was perfect...besides the sommelier who seemed very disappointed in a quit rude way that we didn't order a bottle over 70$!"
"I spent the spa day at Fontainebleau and I couldn't chose better restaurant than this, the food is absolutely delightful and tasty."
"The food wasn't really good I just like the noodles and the virgin hakka made by Greg was really the most delicious cocktail I've never drunk
Thank you Greg 👌🏼"
Our favorite restaurant in the Miami area.  Our entire meal was fabulous.  I had the Ostrich dish and it was wonderful.  The ambiance and service were second to none.  Would definitely dine here again!
"Decor, ambiance, service, food are all quite lovely, but nothing that will make you say ""oh I must return again"" for this or that particular dish.

Generous portions allow you to split appetizer, entree, veggie and rice and leave very full. Sauces are universally very heavy and rich rather than delicate or nuanced.

Prices are reasonable considering decor, location, service, portions, and quality of ingredients. It's just that there is nothing that is really remarkable or memorable. 

But still a solid four star experience, just not five star however. I would recommend for business or for tourist with an unsophisticated palate."
"We came to Hakkasan for a business dinner preceded by drinks at the bar. The place is trendy ... but in a good way. Service is efficient and the drinks are well crafted. The food is quite excellent; we sampled several menu items and enjoyed them all. Food presentation ranges from smart to inspired. This is a great place to bring a date, friends or business associates provided that you're prepared to pay Miami Beach resort prices."
"First impressions are everything. While we waited for the table, we sat at the bar. The barman seemed annoyed that we'd ordered drinks and was frankly, quite unhelpful. However, one we seated by the friendly hostess things rapidly improved. The food was gorgeous and although expensive, felt very good value. Would eat here again, but ask to be seated straightaway. I would recommend the foie gras dumplings and roasted satay chicken."
"We visited Hakkasan on the last day of our vacation and we were blown away. From the Chinese Mule cocktail at the bar to the very nice (and reasonable) bottle of Brut recommended by the sommelier, the drinks were amazing. We had two appetisers, two entrees and a dessert. Everything was superb. 

The atmosphere was wonderful, you wouldn't believe you were on the 4th floor of a Miami hotel. The dining room is very large but separated into very small sections with decorative trelliswork encouraging a very romantic mood with a little bit of mystery.

The waitresses were excellent and the service was some of the best I've received. We'll definitely return next time we're in Miami and although it was expensive at around $500 for dinner and drinks for two, I felt it was definitely an experience worth every penny."
"I would not recommend going to Hakkasan without a reservation. This was my fourth visit, but the first time I've dined without a reservation. I recommended the restaurant to co workers for a dining experience I knew they would enjoy. I took a chance thinking that a Thursday night during hurricane season in Miami meant it would be slow.......wrong!!!! It was super busy! The hostess was polite and assured me if anyone was late for their reservation she would work me in. When she asked for my name she asked if I was staying in the hotel, which I replied no  (I have stayed in the past and I like the fact that my name was being preserved somewhere). She assured me she would try to work it out......we sat at the bar and consumed appetizers and drinks and at the 30 minute mark checked back with the hostess......nothing yet, but she assured me she hadn't forgotten about me........5 minutes later presto.....seated at a table and ordering!!!

What a great time with smoked Chilean sea bass, peppered beef, crispy duck, lemon chicken, orange chicken, seafood fried rice, noodles with mushrooms (can't remember the name but we placed a second order when we ran out)........sticky toffee cake for dessert and we could barely walk! My coworkers talked about the tasty food to everyone the next day......we all agree that the volume of the upbeat music should be turned down so that you can hear everyone at the table speak......this isn't the night club or the lobby cocktail lounge.....they need to make that one change to up the ambiance!!   I'll be back again.....with or without the music volume change......the service was good, but getting the bill after dessert was a work out! Could have been this particular server as I've never had a problem paying in the past."
"Having been recommended Hakkasan London we decided to try the Miami restaurant out. I had extremely high hopes of the food to which the presentation was exquisite, but unfortunately the taste of my orange chicken dish wasn't. The service was professional and efficient and the ambience and decor is superb. 
My friends ordered the duck and Szechuan chicken to which they would have recommended. I think perhaps I went for the wrong dish."
"We were staying at Fontainebleau and decided to have dinner here one night. The food was fantastic. We started with the Dim Sum appetizer which was amazing. Then we had the shrimp in pineapple, scallops and chicken fried rice. All was really good. We would definitely return. Maybe a little pricey but well worth it."
"Me and my husband are in Miami in vacation. We are both from Brazil. We heard about the Miami Spice event and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try a renowned and upscale restaurant for a common -meal price.  I checked several of the menus at different places and chose Hakkasan because it seemed like they weren't trying to fool customers by offering cheaper plates as gourmet food. And I was right. The food was splendid, the service was impeccable- from the hosts, the bartender, our waiter Ken, the guys who changed and replaced the plates... Everybody were very corteous and friendly, we felt genuinely welcomed. Along with the food, it made all for an unforgetable experience. Thank you Hakkasan!"
This is the best restaurant at the Fontainebleau. Food and service is amazing. A bit pricey but worth it.
Went here for a romantic meal with my partner.we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the Fontainebleau hotel where it is located is very cool.food was very good but was not the highlight for us.
"Being a lover of Hakkasan I wanted to see what the Miami version was like.  The restaurant has the standard food and drinks menu. For me the ambience and set up isn't as nice as the two in London, but still nice. If you're craving it then go and you won't be disappointed. Staff were friendly and very attentive."
"This restaurant is affiliated with the famous London establishment.  It is fine dining, and definitely NOT what we know of as Chinese food.  The dishes were prepared well and everything is served with a bit of an artistic touch.  I can see why many Asians (i.e. my wife) take pictures of their food before they eat it.
There is a trendy large bar that serves good drinks.  This is a good place to go if you are on an expense account.  The manager Francois was very attentive to our needs."
The food was OK. The food was served warm not hot. The waiter seemed to rush us from one dish to another. Felt rushed and I thought the food would be better. I was disappointed in the restaurant.
I stayed at the Fontaninebleau on a girl's trip and we dined at Hakkasan on our first night in Miami. We were late for our reservation which was at 9:30 and we arrived at 9:50 but had called to inform them. They made us wait at the bar and we were there for 40 minutes! The place was packed despite how late it was. We had great service at the bar and then were seated. The atmosphere was great and we ordered a lot of food and all was good except the Chilean Sea Bass. The server immediately removed it from the bill and apologized. Overall I really enjoyed the restaurant and would go back. It's a fun spot in a fun hotel.
The menu was so unique and the decor was stunning. You need a reservation there bc it gets packed so make sure you call in the am. They squeezed us in and I was thrilled we got a chance to experience it. I ordered the chicken orange appetizer. It was mouth watering. The honey sea bass was so soft and cooked perfectly. The tip is included so make sure you pay attention to the total price. Quiet environment mostly because we were there around 6:30.
"We made a reservation for 9:30 on Saturday 9/5/15. We got there on time and were told to wait at bar for 15 minutes, No problem so we did. Everything was fine till our server came to our table. He seemed like he was ready to go home...after explaining the menu briefly to us he said ""just want to let you know my time is limited"" as he pointed to his watch. NEVER in my life have I ever had a server say this to me at a fine dining restaurant. After bringing our food he reminded us that ""almost all the sauces were put away due to them closing"" we had to scarf our meals down so we wouldn't ""inconvenience"" him. He obviously did not care about pleasing his costumers because his gratuity was already included (which I don't care, but at least be kind to your customers and suck it up!"" we don't care if you're in a rush to go party at LIV. we got there early and ordered early, I did not appreciate being rushed through my dinner, he's lucky the food was good. Will never go again, GO TO NOBU OR MR CHOW INSTEAD!"
Went here for dinner with my husband and unfortunately We were not very hungry when we arrived. We ordered the ribs and dim sum dumplings both were very good and then the mango custard for desert it was really good. The atmosphere and service were top notch looking forward to going back on an empty stomach lol
"Really authentic Chinese food with modern touch, upscale restaurant at the Fontainebleau. We booked a table which was a good idea as the place is super busy. The service is excellent, polite, on time and most of all kind. The wine and champagne list is extensive, really great options. And the food... the dim sums, the won ton soup, the ribs, the pork belly - all excellent choices! Be careful as the ""small eats"" on the menu are not that small :-))"
Hakassan and Zuma together in my opinion are the best 2 modern Asian restaurant in Miami. I must say that Hakassan needs a little renovation but the food still amazing. Bigger than the London one and more casual.
"this restaurant was highly recommended by the concierge at our hotel and he was not wrong. The waitress explained the culture of the restaurant and went through the menu with us and looked after us all evening which enhanced our experience greatly. The food was superb, every course, and the atmosphere in the restaurant was relaxed and extremely enjoyable."
"Good food, good service, good looking place also.
Inside of the Fountainebleau hotel, ask for directions."
"Whilst staying at the Fontainebleau we visited this Hakkasan restaurant and all I can say is what a treat it was. This was very much on par with the London restaurant and the service and attention to detail probably better. The food was amazing - the pipa duck exquisite and the beef dish truly special. To top it off the service we received was impeccable and in particular from Tyler who talked us through the menu, and was incredibly helpful giving us recommendations for restaurants/places for our next destination on our trip.

All in all very pleased with the experience and would highly recommend - we will be back!"
"We visited Hakkasan at the Fontainebleau Hotel on Miami Beach this past week with some friends to celebrate a birthday. We visit the restaurant at least once per year - with every visit as good as our first wonderful experience.
This visit we all elected to have the seasonal Miami Spice dinner. All the dishes were outstanding with unique flavors and textures that made the overall sampling quite special. We have never had a dish that was less than excellent.
We went on a Tuesday evening which led to two somewhat unique experiences: First was that the hotel, which is usually jumping with people decked out in interesting attire (or some with little on), was quite quiet and sedate; Second, as the restaurant was somewhat empty when we first arrived, we were able to get special attention from our waiter - Antoine. His input regarding the dishes, together with his engaging conversation help make the evening quite special.
We highly recommend this restaurant to locals and anyone visiting the area."
"My husband and I went for Miami Spice. It was so wonderful. The Miami Spice menu was exceptional, as we ended up trying every item on the menu. In addition, we ordered the spicy seafood fried rice and the spicy lamb with bamboo shoots. The waiter was very attentive and flexible. Everything we ate was magnificent. Be warned that the portions are a bit small, so you may want to get an appetizer and one of their ""out of this word"" desserts. Chef Debra Lee is the absolute best pastry chef ever!
I will definitely return soon."
"Everything in this place is amazing, the location, the ambiance, the service, and the food, OMG the food!!!
I went to Hakkasan in a double date and we spent a wonderful time together.
I order the red snapper and it was delicious, although the best part was the dessert, mine was the coconut panna cotta... yaaaam! 
The hotel has their own valet parking, but if you want to park your car, there's a public parking near the hotel, very convenient."
If you want a brunch that will leave you speechless and happy.  Go to Hakkasan on any Sunday for this fantastic experience. Try everything and you will want to come back again and again.
"We were told by our concierge at the St. Regis this was a must for cuisine and service. They arraigned the house car to take us to the Fountainbleu, a brand new Bentley. Arriving you overwhelmed by the hotel and feels little to Vegas. But up to the the 4 floor and it was a different experience. We started at the bar and were taken care of by Elana. She may us feel at home and gave us some great suggestions for dinner. We found out she was from Russia and got her degree in hospitality. An honorable profession and someone who was excellent at going beyond just serving drinks. Then were seated for dinner and Marcos lit up the place and gave us a sincere welcome to what he says was his home and we totally felt it. Carlos help us put together an amazing selection that with flavors and taste was one of our best in Miami. We started with pan fried veg dumplings. A good mix and not your typical mix but very fresh and tasteful. Then the pepered beef. Wow. We also ordered the lobster steamed in chili sauce, not home and so tender and prepared for easy eating. Marcos also recommended the green beans with garlic and onions. So, so good. Tyler the manager stopped by multiple times to see if we needed anything. Also a skill professional trained in hospitality in Europe. The sommelier gave us some great wine choices that complimented the meal perfectly. My only disappointment is leaving on the west coast it will be a while till we can come again. It was a meal and experience we will always treasure. Thanks to Servers, Staff, Cooks and all that gave us a night to remember."
"I've been wanting to try Hakkasan for months, especially after hearing about the vegetarian tasting menu.  And really, if you're vegetarian and stuck on Miami Beach and don't want to dine next to drunk, noisy knuckleheads, this may be an excellent option.  The decor is beautiful and the service is excellent. The cocktails are delicious, but cost $16.  The food, however, is just ""meh.""  Our vegetarian dumplings (4 varieties! yay!) had a good flavor but they were over-steamed so they fell apart before we could get them to our mouths (boo!).  The mushroom noodles were made with fresh noodles (yay!) but had almost no flavor so we had to doctor them with condiments (boo!). The tofu with mushrooms was ordinary and really, a little dreary. The vegetarian chicken was probably the best and most unusual thing on offer, and I would definitely eat it again.  The pak choi was perfectly cooked and seasoned, delicate and crisp. But all in all, I wouldn't go to the trouble of driving to Miami Beach and paying $15 for valet parking (no self parking available) in addition to the cost of the meal and drinks, for a meal that wasn't truly awesome.  Tropical Chinese is a much better choice, both for vegetarians and non-vegetarians, particularly with their new menu-- although the prices aren't much cheaper."
"We went yesterday for lunch, they have a very good Miami Spice menu, the food was delicious, good wine and great service."
"We highly recommend this place! The food is beyond compare! Very well done, excellent staff! They are great at suggestions and usually right!"
"I picked Hakkasan for my birthday brunch, because I've been there many times, cuisine is amazing and the service top notch but also cause this is a jewel amongst restaurants and every fine diner knows it. George and his team were on point, so professional and menu knowledgeable. The Dim Sum menu gives you a wide variety of choices for everyone. So go there, enjoy and don't forget dessert.
."
"The Sunday Brunch with Miami Spice at Hakkasan was just right. The dim sum choices with shrimp, chicken and mushrooms were delectable. Two at the table had to choose the same  vegetarian or meat entree, so we could not try both. But there was plenty of food.  WE will definitely return for more."
"This restaurant is not only to eat very good food. It an amazing experience: great food, great service, great atmosphere"
Went to hakkasan in Miami last night and had a great experience. The waiters knew what they were talking about and were very attentive. The manager named Tyler was so polite and helpful. Came over to our table and gave us a bunch of places to go around miami. Love love love that kind of service! If you like good service with a warm welcome you will love hakkasan and ask for Tyler!!!
"If you're looking for a quiet, romantic, and elegant experience- look no where but Hakkasan. What a hidden gem! The drinks were great, the food was INCREDIBLE, and the staff were very accommodating. Since this was our first time here, our server Ati was happy to help with any questions and had great suggestions. (FYI the Waghu Beef is well worth the price); the portions are sharing size, so bring your appetite! Tyler, the manager, approached us and made sure we were enjoying our dinner (I thought that was sweet). I will most definitely be visiting again before my trip is over, thank you again Hakkasan for such a phenomenal experience!"
The food flavors at this restaurant were exquisite. A reservation is suggested. The service was excellent. The sommelier was very helpful. We tried the chefs choice menu and were' re glad we did. The duck was very good and that's always a great test for Chinese cuisine. The seating is great as it's set up to give a sense of intimacy. The music was a bit loud - my only criticism. We'll revisit.
I was a bit disappointed with Hakkasan; the drinks were absolutely nothing special and the food was extremely salty to the point we couldn't really eat half of what we had ordered. Service also didn't even compare to the one we receive in London and we were extremely annoyed with our neighbour table as they wouldn't stop complaining all night long about how noisy the restaurant was. Not sure I'd go back.
My friend and I had the Miami Spice Lunch Menu and the food was very good.  Our waiter was Daniel B.  We had a great time.Thanks.
"Having heard about Hakkasan for quite some time, Miami Spice afforded my boyfriend and I the opportunity to try it out without breaking the bank.  We were not disappointed.  The atmosphere inside is a mix of contemporary chic with old world China.  With the carved wood partitions, you feel a sense of privacy in nearly every area of the restaurant.  We enjoyed each piece on the dim sum platter, the steamed prawns were my favorite.  The smoked soy chicken was just delicious, so rich and savory in its flavor.  The deep fried crispy snapper was pair perfectly with the orange sauce that really makes the dish.  Neither of us were crazy about the pak choi, but it was prepared well.  The grilled honey pork with noodle soup was simply perfect, surprisingly my favorite dish.  Both of the deserts, the white chocolate panna cotta & mango custard were great.  For the price of Spice, you can't find much higher value at other restaurants.  Its one of the best Spice offerings in my opinion.  Lastly, service was not perfect, but not bad either, we did have to request refills on multiple occasions which is a bit annoying when you're distracted from your meal and company by looking for your server."
"The food and atmosphere were great.  The roasted duck was delicious.
Our server Daniel, was incredible."
Went for the second time whilst staying at The Fontainebleu.  The food is excellent complimented by the excellent wait staff Antoine & Ken.  Started with the Dim Sum platter which was exquisitely cooked followed by the lamb which is a perennial favourite.  All topped by the excellent ministrations of the manager Tyler lead to a 5 star experience.
"Part of the point of Miami Spice is to introduce you to venues that you might not otherwise try at their retail price point.  Hakkasan puts a great value meal on as their Miami Spice showcase.  You get a generous duck salad - fresh and savory.  You get an entree course with fried rice, beef, fish, book chop and mushrooms.  The serving size is generous here, as well.  You do get a choice for dessert.  Both options were ample and delicious.  If anything marred this introduction to Hakkasan, it was the waiter's disgusted reaction when we asked for the spice menu.  They tack an automatic 18% on the bill so he clearly wasn't trying hard to earn the tip.  If they want locals back, they better orient the wait staff."
"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. Firstly, I loved the food. Every dish ordered was delicious and aesthetically pleasing, and completely worth the money.  They had a great selection and there was not one dish that I didn't like. Also, the atmosphere was great. It was so chic and designed to impress. However, the only downside was the service. At first, it was great and our waiters were attentive and knowledgeable(we had a very large group so I understand it was a lot to handle) but then towards the end of dinner, it seems our waiter went missing for a while and some of us were waiting on drinks. Overall, it was a very good dining experience, although I would expect with such a high quality restaurant, the service would represent that as well."
great atmosphere and food. service was great. you have to try the dumplings and the orange chicken. food was fresh and tasty.
Loved everything we ordered! Great wine as well. Our service was a little slow but we had a large party so that may have been part of it. They did accommodate a late arrival and pushed us back 30 minutes with no problem.
"We've heard about this place for along time. Friends have boasted how the Dim Sum is awesome! So we finally decided to try Sunday Brunch.....Beautiful restaurant, great service, crowded valet parking, expensive marginal food. Lunch for 3 people was $200.... Won't be back."
"The reality is far from reputation
Bad reception, awful food, Many of the guests  come to  to drink and celebrate birthdays and are very noisy
There are only the prices that reach a High Level"
"Had a wonderful time. Placed a reservation on Open Table and mentioned in the note section it was my girlfriends birthday. When we arrived for our reservation there was a beautifully branded Hakkasan card at the table wishing her a happy birthday. I have dined at Hakkasan at least 6 times and the food is always superb. Our waitress Crystal was phenomenal and really took the time to make our dining experience special.

"Finally got to try this great restaurant for the Miami Spice promotion. We went for lunch on a Sunday in August, and it was quite busy! Had a few cocktails at the bar, which were all ""designer"" and tasted great. The Western Smash was my favorite.

The miami spice menu comes with a dim sum appetizer with 4 different pieces. Each was a delight!!! By far, the best dim sum I've ever tasted. Super highest quality! The main course was met with mixed reviews from my table: it was a fried chicken breast strips in a key lime honey sauce. I personally really liked it, as the flavour of the sauce was something very unique that I've never tasted before. The chicken itself was ok, but nothing special. Luckily... we ordered a crispy duck dish extra... now THIS was spectacular! The best duck I've ever had!!! Easily 10 or 20 times better than the chicken dish. The deserts were great and interesting, and not too heavy, but nothing I will dream about. 

I will definitely return to try the miami spice dinner menu... and I will be sure to have some duck!!

One small criticism: this is a very high-class & expensive restaurant. I would have expected the food service to have come more quickly. We weren't rushing, but I was surprised how long it took to receive our dishes between courses."
"What an amazing place to dine, the minute  you walk in you are wowed by the ambience and greeted by smiling faces of the staff.

An abundance of food to choose from makes it hard to decide what to order especially when your mouth is watering at all the delicious options. 
 
Recommendations by the host didn't fall short of what was superb the duck with crispy skin and a sweet sauce, vegetable dumplings and mushroom noodles tasted so authentic and fresh, not to mention they are signature dishes of the chef.

A fabulous place to dine with family, friends or solo as I did, a huge thank you to Tyler and Daniel B for making my Hakkasan experience a truly wonderful one."
"We love Dim Sum and drove from our home an hour away to Miami Beach to have the Dim Sum lunch at Hakkasan.  The restaurant is beautiful.  The reception staff in the restaurant is quite friendly and helpful.  

The menu offers a large selection of Dim Sum and we tried to order several types for variety.  The food preparation at Hakkasan is excellent.  The seasonings and textures of the food we were served was outstanding.  

Unfortunately, on this particular day, we were not entirely happy with the waitress for our table.  I'm not saying this should be construed as typical service at Hakkasan.  It was this one waitress on this one particular day.  Maybe she was new.  Maybe they were short staffed.

It took forever to get our cocktails.  Forever !!  The next problem was when the waitress forgot one of the Dim Sum plates we had ordered.  Next was that we had to request the dessert menu twice.  She kept forgetting to bring it.  Finally, we had to wait forever AGAIN to get our coffee.  We were going to just get up and leave without waiting any longer until she finally brought it. 

A gratuity (tip) of 18% is automatically added to your bill.  Ordinarily in a restaurant of this level we would love to leave a bit extra and make it 20%.  In this case, however, we didn't bother leaving anything extra.

We would definitely return for the Dim Sum.  But we would request a table with a better server.

BTW….if you valet park…..expect a very long wait to get your car back.  The cashier at the valet was telling people it was a 20 minute wait.  But it was more like 45 minutes and there is no place in the shade to sit while you are waiting.  Perhaps the hotel could remedy this by hiring more valets and by providing a shaded place to sit and wait in the afternoon sun."
"We just left the restaurant. It was a fantastic dining experience. Our server, Ken made several wonderful appetizer and dinner recommendations. Thanks so much for a lovely birthday celebration."
"Spice menu is worth it only if you are in the area Saturday or Sunday. Dim sum dumplings (4 per person ) OK, bok choy and noodles good.  Meyer Lemon chicken a bit too well done ( expect better from this establishment). The hot sauce helped to add flavor. Of the two desserts offered we preferred the coconut panna cotta.  We found the ""signature"" ribs that we side ordered lacking. Experience would have been better if they did not deliver all our dishes at once!!!  Almost expected to receive the dessert with our main meal."
Expensive but it worth the experience. I recommend to book in advance. perfect for couples. Check if tips are included.
"We had planned to pay a visit at this restaurant in Miami Beach, since we know very well the one in Doha. The setup is very alike. The service it's not so sharp. We noticed that they don't suggest the Miami Spice Menu, we had to ask for fit.
The food was excelent. The Miami Spice Menu for dinner was very well chosen and it was excelent and plenty. Before I could ask for coffee.... the bill was brought to us (big 'gaffe'), this will, in no way, stop us from going back."
"I went to have brunch with friends on Sunday and the atmosphere was great. Although we did not have a reservation, the staff gave us a table for 4 people with no inconveniences. Food was very good and the Miami spice menu was great. I'm not a fan of dim-sum but the selection they had was excellent."
This was my first time at Hakkasan and i have to say it met my expectations. The vibe of the restaurant is very sexy - great for large groups or a date. The food was fantastic. Our waitor made some really great recommendations and each choice was excellent. Def a must try if you've never been here before.
"The atmosphere, the service and the food in this restaurant is impeccable!  I would love to go back there!!!"
"I stayed in the resort and had dinner and drinks at the bar. The food was amazing, the drinks were fabulous and Gregory was the best server! He made great recommendations."
"I have gone to this place multiple times and have NEVER been disappointed even once. It is amazing how well they treat you and how well cared for you feel once you are done with your meal. We had lunch at this restaurant and were recommended to try the pre-fixed menu for the Miami Spice month. Since I didn't eat red meat or shell fish, they suggested that I try their vegetarian option and what an amazing job the chef had done. We had four different kinds of dumpling, stir fried bok choy, fried noodles, a dish with stirred fried sugar snap peas, red peppers with imitation chicken which was amazing and another dish of deep fried tofu with stir fried egg plant and mushrooms. Very filling and all for $29 per head. OhI I forgot, we also got two desserts-- wanna cotta and citrus pudding, both of which were delicious. I loved every single dish and can't wait to go back. This place has never disappointed me even once."
No doubt that it was the best Chinese I have ever been. It gets very busy so recommend to book in advance because I had to wait for an hour to get a table. But is was worth waiting!! I think that the jasmine tea smoked ribs were the best ribs I have ever tried. You could probably eat them with a spoon because they were melting in your mouth. Also loved their special cocktail with lychi.
This restaurant is gorgeous! Loved walking out of the elevator and right into it.  So private and I love the setting.  Of course it was expensive.  Went for moms bday $500 check.
"We were celebrating my fathers birthday and everyone had a great time and we enjoy all the food and service they provided us, I can honestly say that I can't wait to be back."
"We visited here August 2015 whilst staying at the Fontainebleau hotel. We're huge Chinese food fans so, it being in our hotel, it was too good an opportunity to miss. We were able to book online in our room - not that we needed to. The restaurant was fairly quiet for a Tuesday but still had a good atmosphere nonetheless. Our waiter was extremely attentive and we were very impressed with the service we received. We ordered starters of prawn toast and the dim sum platter both of which were mindblowingly amazing! For mains we ordered Pi Pa Roasted Duck (if you love duck this is definitely the dish for you!), spring onion and egg fried rice, noodles with chicken strips, crispy Szechuan beef and orange chicken. The selected we ordered was perfect - couldn't fault a thing! If you love Chinese cuisine then this restaurant is definitely worth forking out for!"
"i have to say that the superb food comes with a hefty price tag. 

succulent meat with well seasoned sides and delicious sauces. 

i have never been so wowed by a chinese in my life. 

great service and great vibe

a must try, definetly 

高超"
"Its a great place.  Starting with the corteous staff.  The interior is dark which makes it even more mysterious and cool. The menu has a big variety of selections. The best appetizer is Dim Sum!  The food is great, the drinks are great, everything was just superb!"
"This restaurant was the highlight of our dinners while in south beach. The hotel and restaurant itself had a wonderful atmosphere - I would suggest going a bit earlier and having a drink in the hotel before or after dinner - the food was all delicious - the server was excellent - wish I could remember his name - he explained many dishes and wine - did not try to oversell us on more expensive dishes or wine -which I found a welcome change in south beach! We ordered some appetizers and noodles and rice dishes. The food was excellent!! Enjoyed every minute there - and also this was the only restaurant that informed us that the tip was already included in the bill, which was another testament to this waiter and establishments class - go here - you will not be disappointed!"
"We went without a reservation and was asked to wait 15-20 minutes in the bar. After more than one hour we gently reminded them – and we were seated at a table right behind us in the bar that was unused from the very beginning! Highly unprofessional. We ordered the food and wine to go along. When the waiter came with the glasses, they had fingerprints on and was full of dust – simply unclean! New glasses were presented ok. The food was delicious, but too price compared to other similar places around the world. Staff serving while dining were professional and friendly. The restaurant is a big room, divided up in smaller units by dark wooden structures – works well! The music however, techno, high volume – in a Chinese place? Music was not a good atmosphere driver to accompany good food. Room for improvement! The place is overpriced!"
I've eaten at Hakkasan in London / NY a few times and it doesn't disappoint. I thought the atmosphere at the Miami Beach restaurant was good but perhaps because it's based in a hotel it just didn't have that special occasion vibe that the London restaurant has (there were also a few children running around the entrance and bar which was off putting). The food was tasty although the service was a little lacking - i.e. dishes coming out too late / being forgotten... The vegetarian dumplings weren't nice but I'd really recommend the Stir-fry XO prawn. It's a pretty expensive restaurant and I think there are probably better places to go if you're in Miami Beach.
"Had a fabulous meal here, dim sum followed by yellow tail red snapper. Absolutely delicious! Service was fantastic too, very attentive but not too much, just a great balance. We mentioned we were in miami on honeymoon and we were given complimentary sorbet congratulating us. This was a very nice touch to make us feel special. Would highly recommend :)"
Everything was outstanding here!  Get several dishes to share!  Enjoyed the chargrilled Sea Bass and the Duck Salad!
"During our 6 nights visit we went 2 times to this place. Food was unbelievable good. 
Definitely a place to go and to go back!"
"This place was a surprise as a friend took a group of us here for a celebration. The cocktails were inventive, fun and cerebrally named. We had mixed dumplings and short ribs as appetizers. The delicately crafted flavors were both original and somewhat familiar, each bite a delight. The Peking duck with caviar was amazing, truly cooked to perfection. Everything was truly delicious including the dessert, I ordered the chocolate fondant and was nearly in heaven as a chocolate lover. This is Miami Beach and people were dressed every which way. Be comfortable and enjoy this Highly recommended high priced hangout."
"A visit to this restaurant was the ""treat"" of our holiday.  It far exceeded our expectations.  The food was excellent, the service was of the highest standard, and the ambiance was good (though it is quite dark so the visually impaired might struggle).  The food was not cheap but it was very very good.  As a vegetarian I was well catered for as well."
"My wife and I visited Hakkasan on the recommendation of a friend and it did not disappoint. 

Great menu. Very knowledgable staff who guided us through the many menu options 

Food was fantastic with a great wine list. 

Overall a wonderful meal. If you like Asian food visit Hakkasan"
"Duck with Mango

French beans with olives and dried shrimps.

curry shrimps in coconut..

etc..

the above are my recommended dishes when you visit.

it sounds very westernised,  they are, but to a good degree, they are all different....not like others chain restaurants, everything tastes sweet!!

Tyler and Ati needs special mentions....they make sure our time was excellent.

Recommended....

Peter"
Exceeded expectations! Excellent duck salad!! The dim sum was amazingly good & everyones meal was exceptional! The service was phenomenal... They paid attention to detail & were faultless in service execution!
I didn't expect this place to be my best meal in  Miami but surely it was. Every dish was just perfect from the appetisers to the main course. Eaten at Hakkasan London in the past but this was next level.
We've spend just two days in Miami beach. And this is first time when we decided to go same restaurant twice. We liked food and atmosphere but most of all we like waiters. Those guys are really like there job and you fill their  hospitality and good mood. PS THANKS FOR FINDING MY PHONE GUYS)))
The food was awesome! One of my favorites. I eat here everytime I visit Miami. When you stay at the Fontainebleau they typically give you a resort voucher and I always use it for Hakkasan. There is also a Hakkasan in Vegas.
Francois always makes us feel very important. He provides excellent customer service. Food was excellent. Nice variety. Wine list very impressive
"Our family had a fantastic meal at this restaurant.  The food was superb, the best chinese ever and the service by Daniel G and restaurant manager Tyler was second to none.  We cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough and will be visiting their property in London on our return home to the UK.  It truly made our family vacation and will be returning when we get back from our cruise next week.  A big thank you from the Shadforths"
"We came for few days to Miami Beach and looked for a good Chinese restaurant. We got the best.  The restsurant is located on 4 floor of the Fontainebleau hotel. The service was professional and the waiter helped us choosing the dishes. I was impressed that he first asked whether any of us has any kind of food allergy. This is an important issue. The soup was great, done with perfection. My wife ordered s beef dish which was one of the best we ever ate in such restaurant. The price is high but you will get a very memorable evening. We will definitely return."
"Liked - great food.  I was pleased about the wine pairing suggestion.  I would have never thought to have a wine like the 2007 Allende with Chinese food.  Most of the time, Riesling or Sauvignon Blanc rules the day. 

Disliked - it's relatively expensive - dinner for 4 was $100/person -- The Allende was marked up to $80... That said, most Chinese food isn't this expensive, but then again, this is Hakkasan and it is the Fontainebleau.  

Great service, hearty portions, I would do it again, I would just save up beforehand."
"Returning to Hakkasan this summer, I was very disappointed by the food, which did not match my previous experiences at this restaurant nor at the London and Dubai branches.
Appetizers were on the fatty side (squid, sesame shrimp toast..) with apparently an unfortunate preference from the chef to deep fry everything
The main course of beef was oily and tasteless
Only compensation was a very efficient smiling and professional service as well as a great restaurant director who was very attentive to all his guests."
"really nice restaurant in a lovely hotel. great service, fantastic food, especially the dim sum
not silly prices either and good size portions
cocktails were a bit too spicy for me but this was the best dinner we had on our holiday"
"The staff, the food, the atmosphere it's just fab, loved it. I'd recommend to anyone. The drinks are fab, their cocktails are very fresh and with a special touch like spices. The portions are small, but after you had your dinner you don't feel hungry at all."
"Reservations are a must, and I've tried too many times to get a table without one to know better by now. The Dim Sum sampler platter is as good as you'll encounter this side of Hong Kong. The duck and the pepper beef are both outstanding, and the baby bok choy are the recommended side dish. The surprise of the meal was the sticky toffee cake for dessert. Simply put, it was among the top 2-3 most deliciously enjoyable desserts I've ever had. Even now, the morning after, the thought of the combination of flavors has me salivating. 

Hakkasan has some great private alcoves, so if you're coming for a special occasion, be sure to request a more private space, and they can accommodate you."
"Awesome staff, the ""wine guy"" was very accommodating and the maitre de was extremely personal. We had the special diner with wine pairing and it was fabulous."
My husband and I went last night and had a memorable evening pre Fourth of July festivities. The ambiance is wonderful and makes for a very romantic evening!
"My boyfriend and I went to this amazing restaurant last week. Earlier this year we went to Hakkasan Mayfair in London, and when we now had the opportunity to visit another one, in another city – it was a done deal! When we arrived at the restaurant we got seated right away. (We did have a reservation, on a regular night I don’t think that is necessary though.) We had dim-sum and crab and sweet corn soup for starters. The crab and sweet corn soup was good, but we preferred the dim-sum. The best part, however, was the main courses; we had two different meat dishes -  black pepper beef tenderloin and crispy szechuan beef tenderloin. And both dishes tasted delicious! The service was good, the atmosphere was really great - as expected, and the prices a little high - also as expected. We would recommend everyone visiting South Beach to enjoy a good meal at this place!"
"We love eating here, but we always get the same thing: crispy almond prawn (way better than it sounds), mango duck, and mushroom pull noodle. For dessert, we love the lava cake.  We crave the crispy almond prawn, because the spicy mayo sauce is so delicious!"
"We are fans of Dim Sum and were excited to go to Hakkasan.  Unfortunately, the meal was a disappointment.  First, although the restaurant was half full they sat us in a dark room, next to a family of five with three little children who were running around the restaurant.  This restaurant faces the beach so they had plenty of tables that were open with a beautiful view.   The Dim Sum was just okay.  Nothing special.  There are better restaurants in the area like Tropical Chineseor China Pavilion that are half the price.  To top things off, the waiter forget to bring a few items that were ordered on the prix fixe menu.  She was less than accommodating for the mistake- asking us if we wanted to take it home!.  All I all, not worth it."
"Fantastic food (dim sum, duck pipa...). This was our second visit to that particular Hakkasan, having visited many times other locations of the group. The restaurant can be noisy, so choose your table time with that in mind...
Kenneth, our server, took great care with his colleagues our our table. We cannot wait to come back!"
Very nice surroundings and excellent service but I was a little disappointed with the food. The meal was quite pricey and I felt we were paying more for the atmosphere and surroundings. Worth a visit to be in one the happening restaurants in Miami.
"Really inventive preparation of varied Asian cuisine, using clearly top quality, fresh ingredients. Ideal for those with corporate expense accounts and the need to impress"
"I have been a few times to Hakkasan and this was not the best visit I have had.  The steamed lobster was excellent but the pepper beef was only average.  The tea smoked ribs were v good but the $14 soup not so great.  All in all a great Chinese experience but they need to make sure they maintain the highest standards to justify the cost (we paid $375 for 2 people, without desert)."
My husband and I had such an awesome dinner here with incredible food and service!! Only negative is we got out appetizer with our food but that just shows how efficient this restaurant is!
"The food was awesome as well as the service.   There were 4 of us and we all ordered an entree to share plus an appetizer.   Portions small, we all left hungry.  But would go back again."
"The food at the Hakkasan restaurant in the Fontainbleau, Miami Beach, was only surpassed by the exemplary service from Adriano - 10/10"
"Staying at the Fontainebleau my wife and I thought it would be a must to try the signature restaurant here and we weren't disappointed. 
My wife is vegetarian but that was fine for the staff on the night and both Kyoto and Tyler were wonderful and attentive. 

The Vegetarian dim sum was just terrific as were the mains, I went for the Orange Chicken which was delicious too. 

When we come back to Miami we will definitely be returning here!!"
"Everytime I visit Miami I always eat at Hakkasan, it is very hard to eat anywhere else, the food is exquisite and the service is beyond awesome. My last visit was two weeks ago, Daniel and Tyler the manager took really great care of me."
"Great service and staff - thank you Kyoko and Santiago for taking such good care of our meal - vegetarian, no onion and garlic.  Great ambience and music.  The hotel is beautiful; everyone looked relaxed and happy.  We were there for a business trip and had a great time.  Really a hotel you should visit for any reason, even if it is just for a drink or a look inside.  A delicious pastry shop selling goodies, chocolates, and ice cream!"
Excellent Asian restaurant. All the food is served family style so we got a chance to share each others dishes. We sat for nearly 3 hours eating and laughing. The atmosphere was so welcoming. Best Birthday Dinner ever.
Everything you'd expect from Hakkasan. A menu with a good mix of Chinese favourites and more interesting dishes. Fantastic service that isn't pretentious like so many Miami Beach places.
"While staying at the FountaineBleau hotel in Miami for 5 nights, me and my girlfriend have had the pleasure of experiencing many fine dinning experiences, but we can say that without a doubt, Hakkasan has been the absolute best! Our server Daniel B. was completely professional and explained every dish we received, which helped us tremendously since we ordered the ""Taste of Hakkasan Prix-Fixe""! One of the managers, Tyler, was extremely caring and made sure our experience was the absolute best it could be. While we traditionally don't eat dishes that include Prawn, Sea Urchin, Seabass & Lobster, everything that we were served was delicious and expertly crafted! Our absolute favorite portion of the meal however, was the Peking Duck. The Peking Duck was beyond like anything we have ever had before and you can be sure we'll be back for more! Thank you Hakkasan for providing my and my date one of the absolute best dining experiences we've ever had!"
"I wanna talk about Daniel  B. !!!
He is special guy!! The service was great and he recomended very nice dishes!!!
He understood exactly what we expected fron the dishes.
Unique experience!!
Thanks Daniel!!!"
"My wife and I recently had dinner at Hakkasan. it wasn't the first time we had eaten there as we have had several positive experiences there. This time was no exception. The atmosphere is wonderful, the food excellent and the staff was on point with their service. We were greeted by Tyler the manager on duty who made us feel at home. I had the diced chicken with chili's prepared Szechuan style which was delicious as was my wife's orange chicken. Overall for the price you can't beat the service, location or the food. Very highly recommended!!!"
The Dim Sum and drinks are amazing! This is a great restaurant to go with a big group and share different dishes.
"A weekend lunch time Prix Fixe dim sum menu for 2 - US$28 per person (+ taxes of course) proved to be most satisfying for both taste and wallet.

The menu featured both steamed and fried dim sims; 1 entree, 1 vegetable dish and 1 rice/soup/noodle dish.  Initial thought prior to booking was that the menu seemed to be fairly light-on considering that dim sums are small items.  However, after having having the delectable dim sum delights, entree (BBQ platter of smoked ribs and char sui), vegetable dish (baby pak choi with garlic) and a short soup, we were pleasantly full.

The atmosphere was relaxed, decor was understated elegance set in a traditional Chinese architecture of dark wood panels.

Service was friendly and attentive.

Would come back again and try a la carte dishes if the opportunity arises."
My husband and I were frustrated with food prices at this resort. 3rd dinner on this property. The best dinner spot.  Dishes were prepare excellent. The wait staff was great and dinner dishes were tasty and fantastic. Best restaurant on property. Chinese/Japanese fusion perfect.
"I am generally mid-range eater, but wanted to splurge.  I do so from time to time at Fago de Chao or Joe's Stone Crab.  Hakkasan is great for people watching and that splurge dinner for the average to above average person. If your well above average, you probably come here all the time.  The bar tender was very friendly and good.  The main course, crispy beef, was also good.  But at 16 a drink, and 38 for that course, I left hungry and a little disappointed."
"Everything was good out here, just like every other Hakkasan around the globe, with the exception that it was in the Fontainblaeu Hotel, one of the best in South Beach Miami. Excellent food, excellent service, a must do in Miami!!"
"Yes I know it's Miami and it's in the Fontainebleau hotel right on Collins Avenue, but the Hakkasan is very expensive for what it is. The food is good but not outstanding. 
The duck and mango starter was average, the duck rolls were tasty but again no better than more reasonable restaurants I have eaten in. The main courses of schezuan chicken and Stir-fried Beef with Shishito pepper in Szechuan Peppercorn sauce were again average to good. The bill for 2 of us was $215.00 with wine(2 glasses each of the least expensive wine by the glass on menu).  I would have been happier if it had been closer to $150.00! The restaurant was not overly busy and perhaps that's why..... it is overpriced."
"Among the best dinners I've ever had. Every dish is thoughful and balanced. Nothing we had was ordinary. Excellent wine list as well. I wish I could remember our server's name, as she was great. The Sommelier recommended the perfect wine after asking what we liked (and didn't look at us sideways when we asked for it the bottle to be under $250). From start to finish, a perfect meal."
"Awesome food, great decor! Never had a bad meal here. All the duck dishes are phenomenal,  my wife loves the hot and sour soup."
I have to say that everything from the service to the wine and food was very good. With that said it was very pricy and I don't think I would go back. When they are double the price for Peking Duck compared to very good Manhattan restaurants that says something. Again the food was very good.
"Great meal with great flavors at Fontainebleau hotel. Service was fine, but restaurant is a little bit dark."
"I recently dined with friends and business colleagues at Hakkasan in Miami Beach, at Fontainebleau Resort. We ordered an amazing assortment of dishes: from Peking duck, foie gras dumplings, pan-fried eggplant, and roasted mango duck, to Sanpei chicken claypot, stir-fried prawns, wok baked lobster, and both beef tenderloin options (Szechuan and black pepper). We shared these across our large table, and enjoyed every bite.

I enjoyed the atmosphere and layout of Hakkasan - Miami. The service was excellent--attentive and consultative, without being smothering. Flavorful and well presented, the food pleased everyone in our group. I will definitely return."
"The food was great and the hostess and the waiters were very efficient. Love to go back again soon.
You have to valet and take the elevators to the top floor. But it's worth it."
"Had a lovely drink at the bar before dinner but when it came time for ordering, our waiter was not very helpful . He seemed like he couldn't be bothered to answer my questions and was a bit impatient with me.  my husbands fish dish was delicious but my chicken was just ok. this is not your typical Chinese restaurant and the dishes on the menu are not similar in any way . it's also a little too dark inside and we were seated at a very small table with barely enough room for our plates."
"Not your average chinese food.  The duck dishes are incredible, honestly everything there is really good.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area"
"Great atmosphere, great service and great food! Irina took care of us and helped us pick our dishes. She was an amazing waitress and was very helpful and sweet, always checking how we were doing and making sure we were having a good time and good food. Top class!
Would also like to thank Tyler, who gave us a great list of places to check out in Miami, and being International visitors from Kuwait, this was very much appreciated!
Thank you for an amazing experience guys!"
"The best dim sum on south beach is at Hakkasan.
Excellent food - fresh and fabulous with flavours.
Excellent service - Antoine was an amazing waiter - so so helpful and courteous.
Great ambience! Hakkasan is always stepped up to quality and service  - you just cant go wrong.

was disappointed with the front desk receptionist-very indifferent for a place of this calibre.
Ester please treat everyone equally - seated others very politely and basically just directed us to our table! hmmmm....not so sure she was fair"
Oh man! The food is amazing! Seriously great! the drinks are also just incredible. We went each of our three nights and had two different drinks each time. Who ever invested them is genius. Each one better than the other. Incredible. The service is great too. They take care of everything immediately but they are never bothersome. Best place I have ever eaten.
"Great feel in the restaurant and fantastic food, great waiting staff really helpful with our order making sure we didn't go overboard with the American portion sizes"
"Portions rather large, I would be careful not to order too much.  We let our waiter be our guide, I liked his recommendations but we  order way too much. Tons of meat dishes which impressed by teenager.  I thought would have a view, very dark inside."
"We came here for our son birthday we celebrate 5 month since he was born. 
If you go thru the menu it's hard to decide what you want to order because it's so many things you can get. 
Waiter offer us to try a tasting menu witch has all the best courses that Hakkasan has, we agreed. And it was I guess the best meals in my life. 
Tasting menu has a different variety of dumplings and they are so tasty with a different flavors. My favorite are with crispy lobster and tea sause with a passion fruit and steamed soup dumpling with a sea urchin and salmon roe. 
And my favorite from this evening is stir fried Waygu beef with a pepper sause and baked garlic - is to die for, for sure the best meat in my life, it's taste I will never forget. 
The second favorite is baked Chilean wild caught seabass with Chinese honey and champagne sause. Flavor you never find again so delicious. 
This place a must have while you are in Miami. 
It's expansive but it worth it."
"I went to Hakassan with my friend during a recent trip to Miami. We had a great dinner. We had to wait a little while in the bar but that gave us a chance to check out the cocktails. Our choice after watching the bar staff mix different drinks was to order the Hakka which was delicious. Passion fruit sake, vodka coconut milk among other things. Very delicious. Then on to dinner. XO fried rice. The roast duck and baby Bok Choy.  Lovely. The food was nicely cooked. Tasted delicious and the staff was very nice. Had a great evening. No stress. Just relaxed and enjoyable. Highly recommend it. The only jarring note was walking. Into the fountainbleu hotel and seeing the throngs of people hanging around the lobby. It's a bit chaotic trying to figure out where the restaurant is. Once we figured it out, we were good. It's not cheap, but very reasonable for the quality."
This was suggested by the hotel staff. and I can see why. absolutely amazing food. And the wait staff is also very warm and friendly. well worth the price.
"My first dining experience at Hakkasan was in Mayfair, London! Amazing! At Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel I had another unforgettable experience: Hakkasan Miami! Fusion Chinese/Asian cuisine at its highest standard. Cool and fashion décor. Beautiful lighting. Cosmopolitan atmosphere. Friendly and discreet service. Prices are accordingly and reservations are a must. Bon Appétit!"
"Had dinner and drinks with My boyfriend and another coulpe.  Had to wait in the bar for 45 min to get the table that we reserved a long time ago. Had the only rose whine on the menu. It was good. Dinner was also good, not perfect, but everyone agreed it was good! The crispy duck salad for starter was the best of all the dishes we had. Service was also good,. It's expencive but worth it as it is a fancy and fresh restaurant. Compared to the restaurants on ocean drive. They are priced too high"
"Great experience 
Decor great 
Service awesome 
Food delicious 
Great rhythm 
Just make reservation an hour before dinner time you will be happier 
Overall can't complain walked out with a smile"
"We recewntly had a truly wonderful evening at the Hakkasan in Miami Beach.
We had Daniel B. as a server who was BRILLIANT. He really knows his food and wine and provides excellent unobtrusive service.

The food was the best Chinese food that I have ever had. The wine list is exceptional. The desserts are out of this world.

Hakkasan isnt cheap but you certainly get what you pay for."
"Open table reservation, nice table, perfect and attentive service, excellent food, highly recommended"
"Food was good but unfortunately main course was disjointed
Prawn dish came out with rice - great 
But chicken dish 20 minutes later that had obviously sat under warming lamp for to long was not to usual Hakkasan standard 
We have eaten in Hakkasan London many times and Abu Dhabi plus Dubai - always on it
Miami you need to up your game"
Top Asian fusion in an intriguing setting. Decor feels old world Chinese of dark carved wood and creates a very private dining experience. Service is outstanding.
"its so good to have a such a restaurant near by, offering great food good service nice ambiance nice pan fried dishes..."
"We chose this restaurant as it offered pan fried dishes, which we presumed would be freshly made...wrong...
I have a garlic allergy, we ended up not even being able to have a salad as apparently garlic in all the dressings...
The waiter did try his best..negotiating with the chef! I had to say..you tell me what I can have...No stir fry dishes..all added garlic...no plain noodles..all garlic...
So I had prawns with almonds to start (actually very nice) 
Plain prawns with some vegetables (very tasteless) 
Plain boiled rice (very tasteless)
For this we were presented with a whopping bill...
Embarrassing that a restaurant of this calibre cannot offer you freshly made dishes without using pre prepared sauces...(Go take some lessons at Nobu)"
We had a large group and did a tasting option where they brought multiple courses.  The food was all amazing and the amount they brought was insane.  We could not even touch the last course (chicken). That being said its expensive with Wine we ran about $200 per person.
"This place made our Miami experience even better. The food was delicious, awesome cocktails and a great ambiance. My friend and I ended up having dinner at the bar, Elena and Mauricio ( the bartenders) went above and beyond to take good care of us. Highly recommended it and would definitely go back."
"The food was fair, nothing truly better thah our neighborhood Cantonese restaurant in terms of quality, although the menu items were pretty original. The drinks were OK but not really worth it. The decor was cool. The wait staff was helpful. I would skip this one."
"We had a girls trip in Miami and ended up at Hakkasan with Antoine as our waiter. Up until this point in Miami, our service was okay but not very friendly. Antoine changed all that.  Friendly and informative, he paid attention, but gave us our space. The food was also amazing (but pricey).  Will definitely come back."
"Great ambiance, but a little pricey.  We did a prix fixe menu and ended up spending over $80 on lunch with one bottle of sparkling water and no dessert.  Food was good but not outstanding."
"The service here was terrible. Our waitress, a European blond (wish I would have gotten her name) had the personality of wallpaper, not welcoming one bit. She rushed us to put our order in and NEVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE. No one inquired as to if we were satisfied with our meal, no one asked if I wanted another drink. As for the food, the dim sum was very good and the best part of the meal. The duck was good, but nothing that I could not get elsewhere. The other items we had are not memorable enough for me to recall. For what some of the items are, such as the noodles, the prices do not match up at all. I understand it's Hakkasan, but I feel it's pretty easy to eat just as well or better without the high price tag."
"Just been to Hakasan in Miami at the Fontainebleau. Had not a bad meal there. We eat at Hakasan restaurants in London. While the meal was ok to good it wasn't up to london standard. Unfortunately on return ito the hotel entrance to collect our car from valet parking we were told that we needed to get our ticket validated by the restaurant which meant walking back about a quarter of a mile and a ride in the lift. I asked if they could call the restaurant and validate it that way but they said no and the young lady at the desk seemed to think it amusing. Spoilt a good evening, would not go back."
"I've been fortunate enough to eat at all the wonderful restaurants at the Fountainbleau, however, this was my first experience at Hakkasan. It was amazing! The GM, Francois was so fabulous! He took the time out of a very busy night to come to our table and personally explain the many choices and tell us about his favorite dishes. We ordered what he recommended and it was incredible. Thank you Francois!!  The tenderloin beef is a MUST! The food was a feast for the palate and the decor was intimate, lovely and chic...a feast for the eyes. We were one of the last guests to eat and the staff never made us feel rushed to finish. This is often not the case at the end of the night, even in very upscale restaurants. 
I travel to Miami frequently and cannot wait to return and enjoy this fantastic restaurant again. I have colleagues who visit for business and pleasure and I will definitely recommend Hakkasan. Don't deny yourself an opportunity to enjoy Hakkasan..Bon Appetit!"
"Having been to the original London venue on countless occasions,  I was  little sceptical about going to this post whilst on holiday. I was wrong to be. It was fantastic. The food was bang on the money. The dim sum tasty and a good portion too. The soft shell crab delicious. For entrees you need to order the tenderloin beef. Divine. As was the lamb too. The wine list had enough choice so you can order a modest priced bottle. Cocktails were excellent. Especially the espresso martini. The surroundings and decor are extremely similar to London, which is good as it's very stylish and exclusive. Overall, one of the best restaurants I visited while in Miami. If you have a group of 4 or more, order the peking duck."
"I became a fan of Hakkasan many years ago during a stay in London.  I was instantly blown away by the subterranean decore, incredibly flavorful food and superior service.  I actually planned trips back to London centered around returning to Hakkasan.  This is what makes this review so difficult. I discovered by chance that Hakkasan had opened a restaurant in the Fountainebleau and needless to say jumped at the chance of making a reservation.  Unfortunately from the minute I arrived - the whole experience fell flat ..while the Miami location is almost an exact replica of the decore in London - the service was almost non-existent.  From the host - to the bartender - to our waiter - each lacked personality, charm and even interest in the product they represent.  The bartender actually said she didn't recommend any of the drinks ... and couldn't offer alternatives.  The waiter provided no insight on favorite dishes ... although the foie gras dumplings and Chargrilled sea bass were fantastic - the rest of the dishes we ordered were small and bland ... hoping this was just an off-night as I LOVE this franchise, but given the experience would not have recommended it."
"We had a group of nine people so we had our own private room, which was really nice!  The menu was a little overwhelming at first.  The waiter greeted us said which menu was which and proceeded to tell us about the different style of dinning.  After all of this he then asked us if we would like a cocktail.  I wish that it had been the other way around.  Cocktails first and then explain the menu.  Might just be my preference but thought I would mention it.  We all had the Yum Cha Prix Fixe which was devine!  There was plenty for everyone and the food was fabulous!  I will definitely be back next time in Miami."
"Every time I go to Hakkasan I have a memorable experience. The food is delicious and the service is amazing. Hakkasan has a very nice atmosphere.

The menu offers an extensive variety of flavors to suit almost any palate. I suggest ordering several dishes and share. 

It can get very busy (especially on weekend nights). I highly recommend making a reservation. 

Hakkasan is a bit expensive, but definitely worth it."
The atmosphere is perfect.  There is privacy with the various room separators.  The food is the most delicious I have ever had.  It is expensive but worth it.  Can't wait to go back..
"We went to Hakkasan on a Monday night and it was extremely busy so if you want to go book in advance.  We were a party of six who ordered a number of dishes and shared.  All the food was excellent.  Service was good and the food was quite reasonable considering the price we paid in some other Miami restaurants.  Wine list was good and the champagne was a reasonable price.

My only slight criticism is that the bar area is quite small, so if you have to wait for your table there really is nowhere to sit.  There are a few seats at the bar but not enough for the number of people wanting to sit there."
"It was all in all a great experience, great food, cocktails and wine. If you like an old fashioned cocktail try the marmalade old fashioned, an inspired twist on my favourite cocktail but the orange marmalade adds something special. Dim sum were incredible and the rest of the meal was too!"
"Shrimp in green curry...incredible! Eggplant and mushrooms in black bean sauce, eggplant overcooked. Steamed vegetable dumplings...amazing! Fried rice with taro...delicious. Choi sum...amazing. Server was extraordinarily conscientious, attentive to varying needs, not obtrusive at all. Lovely dining experience. But expensive!"
Food was nothing special but pricey....I can get much better Chinese food at home for a fraction of the cost. Service was even worse than the food. Not worth the money. Although the decor was very beautiful.
"I am sure there a much better restaurants for the money! Dishes average $35-$60 and you would need a few if you are just a little hungry.
Food is good but not worth the trip!"
"Hard to find great chinese.  This was it.  Really delicious, fresh,  unique food.  Great service.  Nice atmosphere."
"Hakkasan is an amazing restaurant.  It's expensive, but worth it.  Some of our personal favorites: The house Hakka cocktail (vodka, sake, lychee) - wow!! Soups - Hot & Sour -or-
Crab/Sweet corn soups, silver cod in champagne & chinese honey -- must try!! spicy pan-seared scallops (delish!), stir-fried French green beans (w/ olive & dried shrimp) - scrumptious! wild mushroom hand-pulled noodles (delicious w/ a spicy kick).  The interior setting of this restaurant (in Miami Beach Fountainbleu Hotel) is gorgeous.  The service is highly professional.  In a town with A LOT of fantastic restaurants, Hakkasan is one of the very best."
Excellent food at the bar- great bar service and a fabulous atmosphere. Attentive staff throughout and great atmosphere.
"Coming from London we weren't sure if going to Hakkasan was the best way to spend an evening in Miami, as this is something we could easily do at home. 
However, we decided that we wanted asian and this seemed like our best bet.
The restaurant is beautifully designed and you are made to feel very welcome. 
The Dim Sum is amazing and I would also recommend the Tofu with Shrimp!"
"Hakkasan is a beautiful restaurant,  the minute you exit the elevator you feel like you've entered another world. Dark carved wood screens, low lights, servers in red silk dresses - all very impressive. Our server was friendly and French -apparently not an oxymoron, LOL.  Let me just say that she was helpful with drink and food suggestions and paid just the right amount of attention to our table. The problem at this restaurant isn't the service, it's the food; and it's a big problem. It's weird, and not in a good way.  I really wanted to like this place, I wanted to be blown away by the food but I wasn't. 
Our appetizers were a spicy shrimp, duck roll and vegetable dumplings. The shrimp were delicious, just spicy enough and perfectly cooked although I have a sneaking suspicion that ketchup was involved in the preparation.  The duck rolls were hot and flavorful but the meat was stringy and the plum sauce served with it was nothing special - hello Kikkomen called they want their sauce back. The dumplings were perfectly browned but the filling was tasteless and mushy with no texture or snap. The other option for dumplings involved foie gras, we didn't order them but the table next to us did, and sent them back.

The entrees didn't  fair much better. We ordered a spicy steak with peppers, two noodle dishes and one of their signature shrimp dishes with wheat flakes. The steak was high quality and well cooked, although there wasn't much of it. The peppers were over abundant and looked like okra. The dish was not a great mix of size, shape and texture. The noodle dishes (ordered by teenagers) were disappointing, I did not try them but the kids were not impressed. The final dish was the shrimp. When they placed it on the table I thought, ""they rolled my shrimp in fish food."" The flavor was both absent and revolting. 

The drinks were delicious and the server modified a cocktail from gin to vodka, the wine was great.  We sent the wheat flake shrimp back and it was promptly removed from the bill, without attitude.

This restaurant could be a subtle, exotic journey to another place. We left feeling like we'd been taken for a ride. Avoid this place and head to Vida instead, a much better choice for sure."
"Our family visited the restaurant three times during our five day stay at the Fountainebleu and found the food exceptional, and the staff very accommodating.  The Sunday brunch was amazing, the quality outstanding and well worth the price.  One of our party needed a special seating arrangement and the manager was very helpful organizing the meal."
"Food was fantastic - although pricey. 
Decor was stunning - dimly lit, modern.
Service - Rude and felt rushed which is not on considering the amount of money we paid for meal!!!"
A must go to when in town.  My husband and I are vegan and the menu was very accommodating.  It was the best Chinese food I have eaten.  Service was also wonderful and attentive.
"Fantastic food, great service we really felt special and the Hakka cocktail is one of the best drinks I've ever tasted."
"I really enjoyed dinner and drinks with friends but was a little stunned when I got the check for the price of the prefix menu.  It's kinds of a sour note after a great evening.  Quite frankly I could have just asked how much it was because the price was not listed on the menu, so I can't blame the place entirely.  Regardless, the food was AMAZING and I would go back (a la carte next time of course)."
"Looooved the Food, great ambiance, hip place.
The manager Dorimar was very kind and compliant. We were 30 minutes late due to a problem with our taxi, upon our arrival 2 hostesses told us that they could seat us only in about 1 hour, of course we lost it and asked for the manager since our delay was out of our control and since I had booked it 2 weeks prior and the manager Dorimar was very kind and compliant, she did everything to make sure we were happy and end up seating us 15 minutes later. Can't wait to go back!!
It's located in the Fontainbleau hotel and in the lobby the Bleau bar was very hip."
"Really beautiful restaurant with excellent service.  We had the steamed snapper and some vegetable dishes, and the hand pulled noodles.  The food in general was very good. Reservations a must."
"My first visit here didn't disappoint: Our three dishes were all first rate: a starter of dumplings; and two entrees with chicken and prawns (I don't remember the exact dishes, and I don't see them on the online menu).

Service was crisp, and our server's recommendations were just right."
"Drinks, food and service were awesome.  The restaurant itself was really great as well.  We cant wait to go back!"
"If you really  appreciate excellent quality Chinese food, with attentive and knowledgeable staff, especially Ati, who guided us through the menu then this should be on your place to visit.  This is without doubt the best Chinese restaurant we have ever visited, a little pricey but then the best always is.  Would definitely book again."
"Food was very good, but not really in the $90 pp good and that was without drinks.  Hot and Sour Soup was OK.  Admit I have never seen appetizers over $100 but the menu had three.  Service was exemplary.  Ambiance was great also.  You might want to use a GPS to get to the restaurant in the hotel as it is way in the back and up an elevator and out the back door.
If the prices were a little lower, I would have rated it higher.  After all this is a Chinese restaurant."
"The dim sum pre fix menu and options were varied, plentiful, and amazing. The first course included meat, vegetable and seafood options and we tried all of the above. AMAZING. 
The grouper entree left me craving more although too full for another bite. And dessert( molten chocolate with coffee ice cream) was a piece of art and enjoyed like a masterpiece."
We arrived at Hakkasan for our 8pm table in plenty of time to find the bar area packed with people waiting for tables.  It seems they had way overbooked with some parties facing a wait of up to 45 minutes.  This is just greedy and call me cynical but I can't help thinking that they must make a lot of money over the bar from waiting guests.  We waited 30 minutes and had an OK meal but certainly not worth the $400+ cost.  Certainly wouldn't bother again.
"What a beautiful upscale Chinese restaurant. A most attentive staff. Interesting dishes although I can't remember any of them. It was a treat though!
Not overstuffed either and I don't think there is any MSG in the food."
We had an impeccable meal for my birthday! Service was great and detailed attention by Francois! A truly memorable night! Best in Miami
"Hakkasan has the total package of ambiance,superb service, and best Chinese food ever that led to our most enjoyable dining experience in Miami. Instead of a big, noisy room, Hakkasan is divided into smaller more intimate sections where you can carry on a quiet conversation. The service is attentive without being obtrusive, the wine list had great selections for any budget, and the food was amazing. Appetizers like the dim sum platter and cripy duck salad are delicious and shareable. For our main courses we both had grilled Chilean sea bass cooked two different ways. My wife's had a honey glaze with just the right amount of sweetness and mine had a brown sauce with shiitake mushrooms  for a little more smokey flavor. They only give you chopsticks unless you request a knife and fork, but the seabass was so tender that chopsticks were all we needed. Unlike some reviewers who ""went home hungry"", we had such large portions of seabass that we took the leftovers back to our condo to enjoy the next day. Some high dollar restaurants leave you feeling cheated. Hakkasan was worth every penny and then some."
"My wife and I went to Hakkasan recently and I must say it did not disappoint . We arrived a bit early and were directed to the bar. The Bartender was very attentive and immediately recommended some great drinks . The ambience is incredible with lots of little nooks , my wife and I both enjoyed the fact that our table seemed very private , even in the middle of a super crowded place . Once seated we were greeted by our waiter , Marcos who was fantastic !! We had an immediate connection with him as he is Brazilian as is my wife,  and he was able to explain some of the menu items to her in Portuguese !  Was a really big help for her .In the end Marcos recommended the chefs tasting menu and it was fantastic . It started off with dim sum . The lobster potsticker was out of this world as were the other 2 pieces . The 2nd course was duck cooked to perfection , crispy on the outside , juicy and full of flavor inside . The 3rd course was a combination of 3 dishes .stir fried beef w/ peppers . Lobster tails in a light spicy sauce and sea bass . All were absolutely fantastic . I highly recommend Hakkasan Miami . We will definitely be visiting again next time we are in town !"
Food is always outstanding! Don't miss shrimp toast appetizer. Noodles with shredded chicken is a must. Skip all shrimp entrees. Great selection sake and wine by the glass. Romantic atmosphere. Service is exceptional. Beware very very expensive.
"As far as Chinese restaurants go, this isn't any ordinary Chinese restaurant.  It has earned Michelin star ratings in Europe for their food so I wanted to dine there to experience the food and atmosphere.  It is a high-end dining experience with excellent service and attentiveness.  The appetizers were excellent - try their dim sum, each prepared uniquely different from each other and the sauces to go with them are wonderful.  The food is simply delicious and the presentation top rate.  This restaurant is originally from London, which they still have two there, and others besides Miami are in NYC, Vegas, Beverly Hills and Dubai."
"Good food as always, busy because of boat show and you needed to book but the service was still good and worth the money"
While not admitting to being a Hakka junkie - after experiencing 6 locations I say that this location is stands out. The bar tenders are passionate about mixing and i found the unique drinks to be memorable. While the bar is not comfortable to eat at and not intended for that - it's comfortable to stop at for the pre dinner cocktail and to see the effort that goes into the mixed speciality drinks. The dim sum is perfectly done and the duck salad and duck dishes are standouts. The quality and quantity is there and while not inexpensive it's well worth it. The team is friendly and helpful and go and enjoy.
"Our waitress was knowledgeable about the dim sum and offerings of their lunch prix fix. We enjoyed all the different flavors and food.  Although expensive, it was worth it.  It's not every day you can enjoy a meal like this!"
Made reservations and was needed. Waitress just okay but food excellent. Nice bar scene. Prices reasonable for quality of food. Authentic dim sum.
"Hakkasan is not cheap. This is a great place if you're on a expense account or celebrating something big. That said, the atmosphere, service and food quality and variety are excellent. I'd love to come back here again - especially if someone else is buying!"
"A set menu (noun - a limited menu offered for a set number of courses, at a fixed price) is not a brunch. And we talk about dim sum + brunch, we expect more than just a set-menu to choose from. To be honest, for one fourth of the price you get a much better variety of dim sum and more tasteful. In best case you could market it under the name ""special Sunday menu"". I believe the whole brunch concept is a cheap way to attack more guests.

The rating is saved by the service, but I am there primary for the brunch and the food that I did not get. Therefore I will keep looking for a great dim-sum brunch restaurant.

P.S. I suggest the management to lookup in Wikipedia what a dim sum brunch is. You can be creative in advertising, but sometime you have to call ""a cat for a cat"" like the French say."
We had a group dinner in a back room. I liked the fried shrimp appetizer. The women's restrooms were extremely DARK! That could be dangerous for old folks.
"Sunday brunch at This place was a nice treat. He venue is pretty cool, and the bar looked interesting, would like to see it at dinner. The Yum cha menu prixe fixe  at $48 was great, the steamed dumplings in particular were ultra fresh and light and all had great flavours. Cocktails good also. That chilli garlic sauce in the side is divine! Worth a visit if you like yum cha!"
Definitely a must visit when in Miami. Super stylish and Delish. Follow it by a walk on the Boardwalk. Delightful! I will return.
"Best Asian food in Miami and probably the East Coast of the United States- unreal experience, top of the line service, beautiful restaurant."
"Food was good.  Server and service were  excellent, but after taking nut allergy seriously when ordering, one dish had nuts.  Food good, not great, it used to be great and so creative and yummy.  Still very expensive."
"Went there for lunch. Dim sum menu for$45 per person. You pick appetizer, entree and desert and drunk. Peach bellinu was delicious. Desert sorbet was to die for. 
Everything was tasty, service super good. Quiet, cozy and romantic."
Cool from start to finish! The deco is stylish and creates an fantastic atmosphere! The service was faultless. The food was the best Chinese food I have ever tasted in my life!
"Had a reservation, and was told by hostess that they were merely getting our table ready.  This was untrue, as we were really waiting for other patrons to finish their meal and leave.  We were told to go around the corner from the hostess to the bar.  We were thinking that it would be a very short wait time for our table to be ready.  15 minutes later, we were frustrated and told by the hostess, with the manager standing right next to her, that our table was STILL not ready.  We then heard one of the other hostesses say that ""they had not gotten up yet.""  My frustration was at a boiling point, which the manager and hostess clearly saw.  We just left, and no one stopped up.  I was shocked and appalled by the lack of professionalism."
"It was our second time at Hakkasan, and as the first, we loved, this time we tried the duck, which is not my favorite dish, but this one was perfect!."
"One of the best meals ever (and we're Foodies!). My third time at a Hakkasan -- twice in London and now in Miami.  Each dish better than the last.
Try the the roast duck with mango, the roast chicken in satay sauce and the prawns cooked with dried shrimp."
Beautiful and cool restaurant! The food is  delicious and the service is great ! Is worth it!!  It is inside the Fontainebleu Hotel.
"OK, also the most expensive chinese food ever as well, but big deal well worth it.  The restaurant is palatially appointed and the service was great."
This is suppose to be a Michelin star restaurant. The food was authentic chinese and prepared well so must be some chinese chefs in the kitchen. The dim sum appetizer was good and the vegetable bean dish prepared like in Beijing. The fish was overlooked sadly but ok. Upset I couldn't get any authentic green tea service.  Sadly our Russian waitress said it wasn't available in this Japanese restaurant. Really. The menu is in Mandarin and English. A little better training is in order folks. Pricy but expected and would go back.  I will bring my own green tea leaves next time.
"Definitely try the tasting menu for lunch.  A good value and delicious.  We had the dim sum tasting menu, and it was fabulous."
"The ambience is terrific. The choices of food are marvelous and the food is very delicious, especially the duck salad and the hot and sour soup."
"This was a wonderful meal.  The food is absolutely some fantastic.  We had a grouper with truffle that was amazing.  In addition, we had a salad that was the most tasty salad I have ever had.  It was not the crispy duck salad, there wasa gluten alergey at the table, however the dressing was sublime and the crunchy tarro root gave texture and taste.  A couple of lookouts, the place is loud and the techno music can stiffle conversation.  In addition, the wine list, while good, is very expensive.  I would not bring children, but I would not hesitate to take my teenagers."
"Can't rate this enough the food was out of this world. I have eaten at the London branch and was interested to see what this Miami one was like and it exceeded expectations, fantastic service and worth every penny!"
"This is a pricey Asian fusion restaurant that is provides a memorable experience with great tasting, full flavor infusion of imaginative plates that is worth the price. The crispy duck salad is popular and has a well-deserved reputation. Other nice dishes are black pepper beef, crispy roasted duck with fresh mango slices and sweet lemon sauce, bok choy with garlic and all of the dumplings. The restaurant is large with several alcoves are decorative partitions which provide the illusion of a private dining experience. The staff is knowledgeable. The overall experience is great and worth a visit (or two)."
"Went on a Thursday night for a birthday celebration a deux. This was our second visit to this restaurant, and I was very happy with our experience. This time, there was a DJ with great tunes playing at just the right volume to keep things animated without interfering with diners' conversations. The highlights for me were the crispy duck salad, the dim sum platter and the Chilean sea bass. All portions are meant for sharing. The wine list is also very impressive and extensive. Although it is pricey, I believe it is money well spent for a great fine Chinese dining experience."
"The restaurant is at the end of a long hallway that smells of chlorine from the resort's many pools. Up an elevator to the fourth (viewless) level. Arrived 10 minutes early for dinner with 8 other people. They would not seat us at the table, there was no room at the bar and no place to sit. The music was so loud we couldn't even have a conversation. The entire place feels more like a club than a restaurant. But the food is so very good. We ate family style so we were able to try many of the dishes -- all were excellent. I do not normally have dessert at an Asian restaurant but I made an exception and I am so glad it did. The mango custard was one of the best desserts I have had ever. Go, but do not expect to be able to hear each other. Waitstaff was excellent; reception, not so much."
"Miami Beach is filled with tremendously good restaurants. Hakkasan, in the Fontainbleu Hotel, stands above all them in design, presentation, service and quality. The food is inspired by nature and presented in a way that creates a visual experience that supplements the wonderful tastes
Our group of four arrived without reservations, but we were able to sit quite comfortably at the beautiful bar. The mixologist became our guide through both the specialty drink and food selections. Elena did a marvelous job of asking a few key questions from each of us, and with that information in hand, she recommended food choices specific to each of our desires and cocktail selections that paired perfectly. Truly a wonderful dining experience and a must visit in Miami."
"Absolutely recommended !

After our first experience at Hakkasan last year, we have become great fans of this fabulous restaurant. Beautifully furnished, it has many different spaces that allow guests to enjoy a quiet and relaxed meal no matter if fully booked. Service is accurate and attentive, food is delicious and well presented and portions well balanced. Dim sum as well as green salad and spicy rice with seafood are superb but curry prawns and dumplings are a must! Special thanks to our waiter, a super professional young guy who has wonderfully taken care of us. Table 300 on Jan. 19th"
"I was not at all impressed with the food.I was a-5 times in that restaurant in 4 years and i was disappointed the last time. the place was trendy before but needs to be modernized .Food is not impressive. I can make it at home!
European deserts !"
"The service was great, just wasn't to impressed with the food. The flavor wasn't there and we just expected more from the Resturant"
"Fantastic service, the ambience is lovely and the food is just amazing. You need your waiter to give you some advice as the menu doesn't do the description of the food justice. We majorly over ordered as we couldn't decide, but it was well worth it. Also as they have quite large sharing portions!"
"enjoyed it with family to the maximum, since we stayed for xmas/ new yrs vacations at Fontainbleu massive hotel!!!! one more hakkassan experience this time very private like a vip setting!!! secluded into dark wooden walls only 4 others next to us enjoying their dinner!!! We actually celebrated our 10 th birthday of our daughter at the last night of the year 2014... The new yr eve!! really impressive and unigue ambiance this one, the service so welcoming, friendly and helpful and the dinner awsome!!! I could easily say its the best hakkasan of all so far, including new yorks and londons, dubai and many more.... our daughter enjoyed her special night and so as our little one!!!!From the moment we step in we knew the outcome would be AAA star!!!! And so it is..... Enjoy it and dont miss it!!!!!! cause you miss the luxury of dark of assia in the heart of south beach! Keep up the great work guys!!!"
"My brother and I are Miami locals and had some family member visiting from France. I must say that our decision to have dinner at hakkasan was up to par. We had the dim sum platter which is a must and beef shortribs very tender! For the main courses we had the fried rice and black truffle duck, prawns and an extremely tender churrasco lets just say that it was all very good. For dessert, a must try is the mango custard and we also had the chocolate ganache which looked so well presented that we almost didn't want to destroy its presentation. George our server was very attentive to details and created a memorable experience for my family and myself, Thank you!"
"I never understood why it was so difficult to get a table at Hakkasan, that is until I experienced the restaurant myself. Immediately you sense a vibrant and energetic vibe, trendy, upscale, lively and stylish are the words that first come to mind as you enter.   We were greeted and seated by a beautiful hostess with a bright smile. 
 Dark wood furnishings and intricate paneling adorn the dark dining area were booths and tables are available. A great bar area to the side was full of very attractive patrons that looked like they were having the time of they’re lives. 
 Our server, suggested for us to start with one of the signature drinks, The Hakka( Grey Goose vodka, TY-KU Sake, coconut, lychee juice and passion fruit) absolutely delicious, but be careful, it sneaks up on you!
 We were so excited to finally visit the restaurant that we decided to let the Chef choose for us, here are some of the dishes He so kindly shared with us:
 -Dim Sum Platter 
-Crispy Duck Salad (The best salad I’ve ever had)
-Crab and Sweet Corn Soup 
-Pan-fried eggplant with dried shrimp and soy sauce (this dish was a complete surprise and my favorite of the evening)
-Black pepper beef tenderloin 
-Wok Fried Yellow Tail Red Snapper in King Soya
-Warm Chocolate Fondant for dessert
 The service, the ambiance and the food exceeded my expectations that evening. If you think it’s a bit pricey, you might want to consider the Dim Sum prix fixe menu for $28 per guest or the Yum Cha prix fixe menu for $45 per guest.
I loved this restaurant so much that I returned for the Dim Sum Brunch. Don’t miss out on the Hakkasan Experience, you’ll love it!"
An amazing place with great ambiance! The food was fantastic (each plate you can only share between 2 people). If there are no spaces available try grabbing a seat at the bar (they serve the whole menu there as well). A bit pricy but so worth the money!
"Second time having lunch at this restaurant and again what a fantastic experience. Splurge on a fantastic lunch or really go for it at dinner. We had six different dishes at lunch and loved each.  Wonderful server friendly, helpful, great suggestions and very patient also was fluent in French Highly recommend"
|I have stayed at the fountainblue many times but never ate at |Hakkasan....what a mistake that was. Everything is a taste sentsation. |Must try!
"Great sharing plates no matter how many people you are with. The food, service and atmosphere were all great!"
"Everything here is just perfect! Great food, beautifully presented, interesting dining room. We went for our anniversary and they presented us with a card and ""happy anniversary"" on our dessert. Our waitress was fabulous and explained all of the dishes that we were unfamiliar with. The staff make you feel special and there is no rush at all. Highly recommended!"
Honestly we came back on our last night in Miami because it was so good! The dessert was incredible. Everything we tried was delicious and the staff were very nice. Great food. Go if you are in town.
"I eat Asian food regularly, and have to say this is one of my best experiences ever.  I would call the style upscale, nouvelle Chinoise.  Familiar flavours with new recipes.  Presentation was beautiful.  Quality was exquisite.  Service was intuitive and prompt."
"Booked our anniversary dinner at Hakkasan Miami back in August - I mentioned on the phone that it was our anniversary and they delivered. When we visited in September, we shown to our own table that was very big but yet intimate as they had placed us in a booth. On the table was a beautifully written anniversary card from the Hakkasan team which was so thoughtful. The service was absolutely amazing, so good that we left an individual tip for our waitress. 

The food was the BEST Cantonese food I have ever eaten! The prawn toast was to die for, the crispy beef was amazing, the dim sum was gorgeous, noodles, rice, etc were equally as good! The cocktails are fab too and the general vibe of this place is how a restaurant should be! Now back in London, I cannot wait to visit their Mayfair branch! - The dessert was also amazing - Chocolate Fondant with ice-cream!  

A holiday in Miami would not be complete without visiting this gem! - Worth every dollar!"
"Firstly, I can't believe how expensive this place is for such unadventurous food. Secondly the service was lovely, the staff were attentive but not annoying. Thirdly, I can't believe I got charged $6 for a small glass of milk that I needed for my baby's bottle. It's quite embarrassing to charge someone for milk when you charge ridiculously for everything else. The milk thing really bothered me. We spent almost $1000 there as a large group so they shouldn't be so stingy about a baby bottle. Maybe it's just me."
Just did not get what I wanted.  Not enough value for the experience.  The amount of food per dish was heartbreaking.
"3 stars seem harsh but 4 stars may be to many so lets split the difference at 3.5 stars! We had the opportunity to sample the Miami Spice Menu and for $23 a person for lunch, let me tell you, it is an extreme value! My reservation for not giving a full 4 stars is based on the fact that service was very slow and spotty. It took us over an hour and a half to receive everything with long delays in between and we had to keep reminding the waiter what we had already had and what we were waiting for. It also seemed that we got our dim sum out of order from what we had expected. No big deal because the food was great! I look forward to exploring the full menu next visit, I just hope service will be a little more on point!"
"Hakkasan is on the 4th floor of the Fountainbleau hotel in South Beach.  It's a beautiful restaurant - very sleek, modern and comfortable.  Service is impeccable.  Our servers, Antoine, spent a good deal of time explaining the different dishes and was quite good at guiding us to good selections.  The menu has a large variety of offerings in all protein categories.  We were very happy with our meals and would definitely return.  We loved the sophistication of the restaurant, the service and the food.  If you are looking for good Chinese in a wow setting, this is your place!"
"After a whrilwind of Art Basel exhibits decides to try Hakkasan at Fountainblew Hotel for the Dim Sum lunch.
The relaxing and quite surroundings in chocolate brown with the bright coral touch on the servers uniforms and soft music was perfect. So was the amazing lunch choose the sea food dim sum very good and beautifully presente, my main dish was grouper in a dark and spicy sauce with steam white rice, DELICIOSO!
My server was Julia very knowledable and helpfull with the menu and had that amazing quality of always being around at the right time.
Truly recomend this place is a BE BACK!"
"This is the second time I'm experiencing Hakkasan. Food was delicious, with the right seasoning and temperature. Service was outstanding. Hakkasan ambience is amazing!!! Music is not too laud which allows a conversation. Coming back very soon !"
This is Chinese but something which which you would have never eaten. Our favorite restaurant in Miami and we are foodies. Love everything here. Will be a costly affair but do a 'Miami Spice' and you can eat so much for $30-$35. Must try if you never eaten in any of the other 10 Hakassans worldwide.
"Fancy and chic. Best chinese in Miami Beach. Dont forget to go to the restrooms, beaaaautiful. The prices are fine. The waiter speaks portuguese as well."
"despite the techno beat the food is fantastic, dim sum, try the peking duck, fish everything is good if you are a foodie"
"One of the best restaurants I've been to.:Excellent service. Food was delicious. I'll definitely recommend the dumplings and the duck salad is a must. Server was excellent, very attentive. There was no wait.... love it. We made reservations. Great atmosphere. A must see if your in Miami."
"well this restaurant seemed a little more pretentious than quality. We just wanted somewhere yum to eat and discovered here, my husband and I saw the menu & were like, Gulp- I think we are making a night of it... 

We sat at the bar for ten minutes without being acknowledged but the staff seemed genuinely apologetic when they realised we were wanting a pre dinner drink- this is a ""see & be seen place"" so being from Europe we didn't quite understand- nor the prices, $14 for a bottle of sparkling water... really?  Do you have to?

ANYWAY the food WAS delicious and the ambience VERY cool- it's lovely to get up and go to the bathroom & explore all the nooks and crannies- I'd recommend this as a special occasion restaurant, not a place to just relax and eat asian food as we wanted- but we certainly got a Miami Beach experience!

Tell your waiter to allow plenty of time between appetizer & main because it's a  pity as the dish prices are hefty, to have to rush through them."
"Had a quick bite but mainly went for the cocktails. Well crafted and interesting flavours in a noisy environment, I was hoping something more quite, the tables were too close to each other! I recommend for to try the hakka cocktail. For the prices you can equally drink same quality cocktails elsewhere on the city!"
"I had dinner at Hakkasan for my 30th birthday and it was a wonderful experience. From service to the quality of the meal, I can't find anything negative to say about this place. I had my four month old with me and they didn't fuss about it, they sat us in a quiet spot and the waiter nicely asked about him and spoke about his kids...so friendly! We ordered the dim sum platter and Sea Bass: best dishes ever!!!!! About every employee in the place wished me a happy birthday! It was great!"
"All the time when I stayed in Miami I always visited this restaurant    To had amazing dinner. The food was excellent, the interior beautiful, service was excellent."
Amazing food and excellent drinks! Everything we ordered from the menu was delicious. They made excellent drinks made from fresh fruits.
"I have been to several Hakkasan restaurants. It was always super. Best oriental food you can eat in an upscale and trendy setting.Once you enter, you are sold, do not be be surprised of the check, you are dining in a trendy hotspot, so prices are related."
"We visited Hakkasan while staying at the Fountainbleau. The food was stunning - truly delicious! The atmosphere is very cool (probably not suitable for kids) and the service was excellent! 

My only gripe is they bought me the wrong dish, and rather than changing it no questions asked they told me to try it to see if I liked it! I did so I didn't get what I had order, no apology either!"
"The food was perfect. They serve fresh asian fusion food. It was tasty, the service and the atmosphere were great. 

My red wine was served a bit too cold."
"This place really is something else! The inside is absolutely beautiful and it really looks like your eating in a true Chinese setting, all the wood is hand carved and really sets the perfect mood. The food is unlike anything you have ever tried before. We had a duck salad that is out of this world, their signature dim sum for appetizers. For our entrees we had their roasted duck with a sauce made from black truffle they import from Italy apparently, the black pepper beef that I will never forget along, and their exquisite peking duck between me and a friend. It was all PHENOMENAL!!! Unlike any food I have ever tried before, the servers were well-educated and really helped me out when choosing what to eat, and the service all the way down to the servers assistants were 5 STAR. I will 100% return and I will recommend this restaurant to ANYONE staying in Miami it truly is a MUST GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Daniel was amazing, he helped us enjoy the best of Chinese/Latin fusion cuisine and made it fun and delicious to try new things."
This restaurant elevates chinese food to a whole new level. Excellent selection of Dim Sum and very unique and interesting combination of ingredients made up for an unforgettable dinner.
A++ food and service.  Our server was extremely helpful with ordering food.  The ambiance was very nice and drinks great as well!  Highly recommend it!
"We had the occasion to meet as a family to celebrate a milestone birthday for my mother who turned 98 years young.  My son was at the Fountainbleau  Hotel in Miami Beach where he was at a conference and he picked this restaurant located in this fabulous hotel.

Our server, Daniel B. was the most intelligent and gracious server.  He educated us as to each
dish and how it would taste and made delightful suggestions which we enjoyed to the fullest!
The Peking Duck was magnificent--without the caviar.  The prawns were delicious.  The beef was the most tender and tasty my husband had ever tasted.  

I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion but also as a great place to meet for dinner.  The furnishings are extremely beautiful.  The bar area is dreamlike.  The prices are higher than average but when you taste the food you will agree it is worth it."
"Food was fantastic, the wait was longer than we would have liked.  Great atmosphere.  We will eat there again."
"Food was ok..... Nothing spectacular.
Some dishes were in fact very average.... And def not worth the price.
Waste of time actually...."
The bar is a must go! The dim sim platter is the best I have ever had. The pi pa duck is delicious. And the dishes are special. The prices are as high as the quality. Highly recommend!
"Just spent four nights at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach Hotel.  As we were not interested in taking cabs all over the city to go to different restaurants, we stayed inside the hotel to eat dinner each night.  The hotel has three ""signature"" restaurants - Scarpetta, Michael Mina 74, and Hakkasan.  We had such a great experience at Hakkasan that we ended up eating dinner there for a second time on the fourth and final night of our stay.

Daniel B. was our waiter at Hakkasan.  We are from Chicago and go out to eat often at Chicago's many excellent restaurants where good service is omnipresent.  That being said, Daniel B. was the best waiter we have ever had!  Daniel B. was polite, professional, friendly, and had a great sense of humor.  He does not rush you to make your order and does not rush the delivery of the food, allowing you to enjoy your meal at the pace you desire rather than making you inhale three courses in 45 minutes like some restaurants.  Most importantly for us, he was very willing to give his recommendations for what we should eat and took into consideration our personal dining preferences (portion size, degree of spiciness, allergies,etc.). After hearing Daniel's recommendations, we selected the Dim Sum Platter, Prawns with pear/almonds, Szechwaun Chicken, and whole Lobster.  All of his recommended menu selections were fantastic, both in taste and presentation.  Hakkasan also has an excellent cocktail menu (the apricot old fashioned is amazing and so was the lychee martini) and we enjoyed the Chocolate Lava Cake with ice cream for desert.  Prices were very reasonable for the quality/presentation of the food as well as the excellent atmosphere/decor in the restaurant.  As previously stated, we had such a great dining experience that when we made the Open Table reservation to eat at Hakkasan for the second time we requested Daniel B as our server and they were happy to accommodate us.

Hakkasan is the best restaurant at the Fontainebleau Hotel.  We recommend it and we strongly suggest you make sure that Daniel B. is your server."
"We ate here while staying at the Fontainebleau.   The restaurant is dark with chic and trendy decor.   After being shown to our table, we were waited upon by Carlos, who could not have been friendlier or more attentive.  Carlos recommended that we order two appetizers and three main courses, all of which the three of us would share.   We took his advice and ordered the dim sum platter and braised short ribs for appetizers.   Afterwards, we had the orange chicken, crispy szechuan beef and pan fried scallops with luffa.   All of the food was excellent and beautifully presented.  For dessert, we shared a molten chocolate cake with ice cream and a mango custard, both of which capped the dinner off perfectly.

Although expensive, we would definitely return to Hakkasan."
We had a great experience dining here last night on our honeymoon. The food was impeccable and our server Sean made us feel like royalty! He made sure we had an incredible experience. The spicy chicken was our favorite dish and The mango custard dessert is a must too!
"We dined at Hakkasan for the first time.  We did not have a reservation for a busy Friday evening, so we dined at the bar.  However, the level of service was excellent.  The food was very inventive.  We had wonderful smoked ribs, an assortment of steamed dumplings, as well as a couple of seafood dishes (Grouper and Scallops).  They were all very delicious.  This is highly recommended."
"Yes this place is very expensive. Yes the portions are not huge. If you are still game, you will get a great dinner - with an exceptional menu of flavorful, creative dishes that are very well cooked. Our servers were terrific. Altogether, it's a very good restaurant in a world famous, 5-star, oceanfront resort.  I'd definitely go again!"
"We arrived last night around 8 o'clock and did not have a reservation.  They us there would be a 20 minute wait, so we decided to check out the bar since they had a full  menu. When we got to the bar we decided it would be difficult for the 4 of us to carry on a conversation.  Went back to the hostess and told her we wanted a table and was  told they had nothing available.  Was not even 5 minutes before and we were told a 20 minute wait.  We ended up eating at the bar.  I hae d a martini and was surprised for $16.00 dollars that the bartenders use a shot glass to measure the drink.  I paid $16.00 dollars and the glass was not even a full drink.  A bottle of soda water was $8.00 dollars.  We had the Prix Fixe for $39.00 dollars per person.  The portions are very small and definetly not worth what you get.  Also had the hot and sour soup which was $14.00 dollars and believe me was not worth the money.  The bartender was not helpful at  all asked if we could substitue the duck because of an allergy told us no then after ten minutes he told us they would.  Would never return.  I don't mind spending alot of money but surely don't want to go home hungry.  The best part of the meal was desert but for $100.00 per person not worth it."
"This was one of my favourite dining experiences of my life-it was perfect. The service by Daniel B was outstanding-his recommendations never missed a beat, he was there but not in your face. He was personable but not overbearing. We hugged and kissed him as we left. The portions were quite large and we struggled to finish everything. The atmosphere was chic and sexy, cool and welcoming. The many private rooms, funky bar and stellar bathrooms made this an outstanding evening out!"
"The moment you enter Hakkasan, at the world famous iconic Fountainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, be prepared for a first class high end Chinese culinary experience.  All of your senses will be excited.  The sleek unique decor, award winning selection of signature dishes and the incredible staff make this restaurant a personal favorite.  My table sampled a variety of dishes which we shared.  The vegetable dim sum was outstanding, the divine crispy duck salad was a hit, a flavorful sesame prawn toast is a must have, outstanding stir-fry X.O. prawns with pineapple was a crowd pleaser, stir fried beef with bean sprouts was devoured quickly, wild mushroom hand pulled noodle dish was terrific and  the desserts were visually appealing and delicious.   Milk chocolate ganache is my favorite dessert.  A highlight was sampling a Hakkasan signature cocktail  the  Smoky Negroni.  Watching the drink being prepared is very interesting and captured everyone's attention. The restaurant manger,Juan Hurtado and the assistant general manager, Hector Diaz, and Shawn our waiter exceeded our expectations in delivering a memorable dining experience. Don't miss this exemplary restaurant!"
The restaurant is trendy with nice furniture. The menu choice is good with a large selection of dishes. The food and service was average. We didn't eat too much as we didn't enjoy the food and atmosphere unfortunately.
"the food was superbe!the setting was nice, the staff was very polite and helpful! i will try it again defenitly"
"It was my birthday and I was visiting Miami, my best friend recommended Hakkasan, my husband and I went and absolutely enjoyed it we will go back and we would recommend it to any and all of our friends."
"food was tasty, different and excellent, although a bit expensive, but worth it! Location is great if you are staying at the hotel and the views from the restaurant were spectacular.  Highly recommend it."
"Been to the one in San Fran, too, and this one is even better.  Get the duck salad, don't hesitate.  Also, the dumplings, you have to.  If you have a group, get a private room, service is wonderful you won't be disappointed.  A good place to impress clients or celebrate a nice occasion with friends and family.  Food is fabulous."
"What can I say, the Scene is outstanding. The atmosphere is Electric, Happening, Hip, Fantastic.
We started out with drinks at the bar which set the mood for the atmosphere and the rest of the dinner., we were a group of 10, celebrating a birthday party. With that many people, we sampled a lot of different things. Dim sum platter, Crispy Duck Salad, Salt and pepper squid, and others.

For dinner I had the stir fried Wagyu beef, it was great!! Everybody loved it, there were no complaints from the group, on anything they ate..
I have to admit, I had not been there, and was a bit skeptical of a restaurant at the Fountain Blue, on a Saturday night, I thought it would be too crazy.. But I had also heard great reviews. It was crazy, the scene at the hotel itself is busy, and full of people that are people watching and like being seen. Very Miami type scene.. It was thoroughly enjoyable, great service, great food, and great atmosphere, hard to get all those at the same time.. 
I really recommend it.."
"We went there to take advantage of the Miami Spice menu, which is very well priced. includes entrees, main and dessert. food was excellent, service was good and drinks were not particularly expensive considering the place. would definitely recommend and go back!"
"The wine list was very good, and the food preparation was terrific.  This is a treat for a night out, and the backdrop of the bar is worth seeing."
I'm usually pretty harsh in my reviews of restaurants especially the food but this restaurant was beyond my imagination. I didn't want to eat Chinese food especially in Miami of all places. The restaurant was convenient because it was in the hotel I was staying in so I acquiesced out of convenience. I didn't really pick much from the menu either because I was under enthused. When the food came I was taken off guard. It was so unbelievably good that I'm almost ashamed to say that the best Chinese food I've ever had was not in China. I'm not even sure what I had because I didn't do the ordering but it was superb. The service was also great but I wasn't paying attention because I was so caught up on the flavors. I might stay at this hotel again just to eat at this restaurant!
"Excellent Chinese cuisine, optimal service, great vibe and wicked cocktails.  We couldn't get a table but ate at the bar.  It was a brilliant evening and we will definitely come back."
This is one of the best restaurants in Miami. Make sure to get a reservation. The food is exceptional. Innovative Asian but still familiar. The service is very good too.
"Traveling on Business solo from Paris and staying at the Fontainebleau, Miami Beach. One of several trips to Miami, I love the selections of restaurants at this hotel. Fine dining at it's best! The bars are a safe and upscale environment for a woman traveling alone. My first visit to Hakkasan this week. I went for drinks in order to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed at all. The restaurant is breathtaking & it has a very wide range of cocktails. The Miami spice Menu was not available for one, but that's understandable because its meant to be served in a family style. The wait staff was so friendly and explained that the menu was a better option for one person. The selections on the menu allowed me unlimited options. The Dim Sum, small bite -size pieces, a journey into Gastronomic Ecstasy. The duck tasted amazing and was prepared perfectly. The service was really friendly. The food is very good and it looks the same as it tastes... Excellent. Scarpetta at the Fontainebleau, the night before, I had the Miami Spice Menu for one and it was amazing too. The wait staff in Scarpetta is like no other I've ever had... Amazing! I highly recommend both these restaurants. You will not go wrong."
"As a corporate traveler, I was shocked, appalled and personally embarrassed by Hakkasan.  A frequent visitor to Miami and the Fountainbleau, I chose to try out Hakkasan and wanted to check out their spice menu. As an executive, I was appropriately dressed (silk dress, heels).I chose to sit at the bar and asked for the Miami spice menu and a wine list. After perusing both, I made my selections and asked for the waiter. He curtly asked me if I ""had anyone else to dine with"" and when I said,no, I am a solo diner, he REFUSED to serve me, telling me that the spice menu was ""not available"" to me unless I had someone else with me.   Seriously!? At 46 yrs old, I haven't been refused service in such a curt and dismissive way in a long long time. Wow. Unreal. Hakkasan, get yourself out of the 70s and embrace the fact that women and men dine solo and that should be ok with you if you want my corporate business. Shame on you for making a spectacle out of me, embarrassing me by refusing to serve me your menu. You will NOT receive any of my company business.  If I could give you a zero for antagonizing patrons I would."
"Fun play on traditional foods that were delicious in a ethereal environment. We sat at the bar which feels like you are underwater, the bar is lighted ocean blue with lights against the back wall the appear as light coming under water. Drinks were well thought out and playful."
"We stayed at the Fountainebleau hotel while visiting Miami so had dinner at Hakkasan one evening. We chose a starter each and shared the mains which was gai lan ( Chinese vegetables) and ma po tofu with young chow rice. These were okay, nothing special and in my view overpriced. The service was very good though."
"Hakkasan Miami Beach only proves the old adage that some people, perhaps many, have more money than sense. The food is so incredibly average, its laughable.  This wouldn't matter except the prices are insanely high for what amounts to terribly mediocre fare.  The atmosphere is pretty nice (a bit dark for my taste) and the bar scene hip,as one might expect at the Fontainebleau Hotel in S. Beach.  But seriously, NO ONE should try to pass off the food as anything approaching artful, high quality or innovative.  Ours wasn't even particularly flavorful or fresh. There are roadside hawker stalls in Singapore charging 1/100th of the price with food that blows this place away.  Trendy hipsters and other wannabes should save dough by popping in to visit the bar and make a bee line someplace else to actually eat. If you are a family and/or some old, fat people, you won't be magically transformed into someone cool merely by forking out for this place.  Dine elsewhere!"
"Food is average. The Argentinean waitress that attended us did not have a single clue about the plates. Music is too loud.
Did not like it at all."
"Simply outstanding. I have been in several Chinese restaurants around the world and this is the best I have ever been. Food was excellent, great atmosphere and it is located within the trendy Fountainblue Hotal of Miami which is probably the best in Miami beach (they made several movies including James Bond...). Back to the restaurant, portions are big enough, service kind and it is quiet. Only point is the cost... It came at 75$ per person (tips included) for half appetiser, 1 main dis, half dessert and we ordered no wine. Anyway, despite this, fully satisfied."
This the best Chinese restaurant in Miami. Great food! The atmosphere is proper for adults. Although it is possible to have dinner there with kids.
"Me and my wife enjoyed one of the most delicious food during at Fontainebleau Miami. We ordered the chicken crispy with orange juice, still have the taste in my mouth.The staff are friendly and accommodating.Thank God the place allows share food because it is very pricy."
"We loved this restaurant and are going to book Hakassan for Vegas. The atmosphere, the bar is all pretty unique and trendy. Food choices are great and they were even willing to make a special cake for us for a birthday celebration."
"This is the definition of the type of restaurant you dont want to goto when in south beach.  sushi rolls were small and expensive, appetizers were a joke, we ordered the kobe beef appetizer and you could see through the meat it was so thin and it was drowning in their sauce.  after we left the restaurant we went to a bar and ordered more food since the 400 dollar meal we just paid for was extremely unfulfilling.  avoid this place"
"While on holiday with some friends, we had dinner in this high level Chinese restaurant.
We all loved the food, the atmosphere e the cocktail bar is fantastic!! Take the Hakka cocktail, it's just great!
I think we will come back there for sure!
Just one thing: it is really cold inside, the air conditioning it is a bit too strong, so girls bring a pashmina or a warm scarf!"
"Couldn't wait to try Hakkasan as i loved the one in London but it didn't quiet match up. Services was good we booked a table about 2 hours in advance no waiting around when we arrived which is always a plus, our waiter was nice but we couldn't alter/tailor the meals to suit our taste which always annoys me! The food itself was pretty good and it's nice inside if a little dark."
"Eating at Hakkasan was by far the best part of my Miami experience. The honey Chilean sea bass is out of this world! And don't even get me started on the dim sum platter.... INCREDIBLE! But beyond the food, the service was impeccable! Our server Antoine took care of every request almost as if reading our minds. He was by far the best server I can ever remember having. If you are in Miami, Hakkasan is a MUST!!"
"I have visited this restaurant many times over the years and always had a meal that was satisfactory or better but last night I was aghast at how poor the experience has become. Despite the presence of a sommelier the by-the-glass choices were awful: a Chinon Rose was in refermentation and the German Kabinett was close to being undrinkable- do they buy their distributors' close-outs? The appetizer portions were so small as to be puny (squid and 'wild"" mushrooms with lettuce), as were most of the main courses we ordered (especially the stir-fried beef).We ordered scallops and were informed that they had ""a very strong oceanic smell"" which seemed to say that they were anything but fresh and we waited over an hour to be able to savor such a masterpiece. The waitress disappeared for very long periods and we had to ask for water, for wine to be poured and when it it ran out for a list to order more. I have never felt worse about a mandatory $ 52 tip than last night. Sensing that something had gone terribly wrong the Restaurant Manager  Juan Hurtado came out to the table and apologetically offered to send us desserts or a new glass of wine and while the gesture was appreciated by that time and over two hours into this debacle we had lost  all interest in further consumption at Hakkasan and we declined. What a major disappointment thsi was!"
"The only reason we went to this restaurant was because of the rave reviews (and the award they got which I don’t know for what exactly!!!)…  but we had the worst experience (except for the customer service!)… unfortunately I can’t remember our server’s name ( he was a young French guy), and he was very professional, helpful, and went above and beyond to meet our requests! The service was top notch!... but the food… ohhhhh! Don’t get me even started… the salad was not really that fresh! … and the food was so bland, we had to ask for salt/pepper or something to add flavour! I tried my husband’s dish , and still was lacking flavours! We were so disappointed, as before coming to restaurant, we were discussing if we should go there or go to our now-favorite Vida (on site restaurant)… after leaving very unsatisfied and still hungry from Hakkassan; we went to Vida for a real great tasting satisfying and flavourful food!... I decided to bump up my rating from ""terrible"" to ""poor"" only because of their customer service! also, very dark restaurant which i dont like personally, but that's just me!"
"- very trendy restaurant 
- the food was ok, nothing compared to the London restaurant
- very expensive
- the overall ambiance was really nice
- the staff was friendly
- beware ....it is really noisy!"
Overpriced chinese food it was just not good at all. We had the prefix and maybe it was just those items that weren't good but that's what im basing this off of.
"By far the best asian option in Miami Beach--and the best restaurant at the spectacular Fountainbleu Hotel.  Please don't be discouraged by the beautiful-but-snooty hostesses (that's a South Beach standard); the rest of the staff and management are EXEMPLARY (Francois and Juan of fine note) and the food, decor and ambience are second to none in Miami Beach or anywhere. Truly a spectacular dining experience.  (PLEASE order the dim sum and the bahamian lobster stir-fry...)"
We are actually now at Hakkasan and need to share our excitement being here... The food is fantastic the environment great and the bar tender Graig is very helpful and cheerfull. Thanks Hakkasan and Graig
"Dim Sum Starter is big enough to share, we also ordered the schezuan beef, and roast chicken satay which was delicious. Loved the decor and the chill out music. Great choice of restaurant"
The food is outstanding! We had a really great beef dish and tofu lettuce wraps. The white coffee ice-cream and chocolate molten cake is out of this world.
"amazing restaurant super food and very good staff the guy who took the order suggested some very good dishes.
I think the best hakkasan comapred to other cities"
"Restaurant is on the 4th floor, went there for lunch, had very good dim sum, and presentation was quite nice as well.  Restaurant was perfect for a quite lunch and the service was very nice and attentive. Parking once you valet , they will stamp your ticket at the hostess stand and it will get you a discount on the parking."
"A bit hard to find. Tucked into a corner upstairs at the Fountainblue. Very cool place. Love the decor. Dim sum was good. Main dishes better. Bar tenders were awesome! Really great drinks. Service was odd and slow, but not too distracting."
"Having been in Miami Beach for two weeks, we have visited Hakkasan twice, and both of the times, the food served has never been hot. Eating a dish hot is completely different when eating the same dish cold. The delivery time from the kitchen to the table needs to be faster. The restaurant is big, has a lot of clients, but for them to maintain a standard, an extra effort must be made. The food has been delicious, and the manager has been generous throughout providing a high standard service, which was very well appreciated by my family. Some servers need to control their mood swings, though. Amazing food, but service brings the ratings down. I expect to see a change during my next visit."
By far this is the best option for some chinese food. The tradition meet modernity. The smoked Negroni is a must not only for the mise-en-scene but also for its flavor. Any dish is a great option but the wagyu beef can not be missed as well as the Grouper with black truffle.
"I love this place and always come with my wife when in South Beach. The food is outstanding, the cocktails are done right, the service is sharp and the atmosphere is great. We enjoyed a range of dishes and will return. Its great for a date or a small group of friends. Even coming from San Francisco, Hakkasan is hard to beat for outstanding Chinese food."
"The restaurant bar is beautiful, and the dining areas are separated, so you wont see more than 5 tables close to you, although the place is a large venue, creating an intimate, cool atmosphere. The menu displays a very good variety on the chinese cuisine, always served in portions to share. It was my second time and I will go back for sure."
"The Hakka experience was once Again second to none. Great service, ambiance, delicious food and drinks!!

I highly recommend this restaurant and bar to all. *****

"Food is always on point, especially the crispy Sezhuan beef!! The fried rice was amazing and the duck I highly recommend. Very cool atmosphere and the restaurant is beautiful, especially the Bar with very cool backlighting on the wall. I go here all the time when my parents or friends come to town."
"A great escape from Miami dinning which rarely does rarefied intimacy.

Loved the decor especially the bar. You got a great vibe from the place and other diners but still had lots of privacy.

Food and wine recommendations where fantastic. 

It's not cheap but not outrageous for what you are getting.

Don't love the smell of the sickly spa products in the elevator but not a major."
"Had an amazing meal and experience.  Brought friends on their honeymoon, restaurant bent over backward to please, including prime table, complimentary desserts, off the list wines and kitchen tour after dinner.  Could not have asked for more."
"I went with a friend on a Saturday night. We made reservations four nights in advance, highly recommend doing so. We arrived a little early and waited at the bar. The bartender was very nice and knowledgeable. They serve the best lychee martinis. For dinner, I highly recommend these appetizers - the duck with mango, short ribs and dim sum sampler. We split three appetizers and were happily stuffed. I cannot wait to go back!"
"As you would expect the food here is good, but not the food/atmosphere experience I was hoping for. The mango custard dessert was excellent and would come back just for that! I am a big fan of dumplings and they were okay. Visited on of their London resturant and would prefer that one. 12 USD valet parking with a sticker from the resturant."
"Was there with a large group for my birthday dinner. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful, it was a great place to grab dinner before heading out."
We dined at this restauraunt and the guy who waited on us was really friendly and very helpful. the food was awesome and our dinner came at the speed of light!... lol.
"We went to Hakkasan on a Tuesday night so it was a little quiet so it was lacking a bit of atmosphere for us but that was no fault of the restaurant. 

We were seated at the very nice long bar where we had a couple of cocktails which were very good and stayed there for 30 minutes as we were in no rush. 

The food portions were quite large and we ordered far too much. The service was excellent, probably the best we have had in Miami as our waitress went through a number of dishes for us explaining the options. 

The food tasted good and the wine was great. The bill come was not cheap at around $240 for 2 but it was well worth it. 

We will go back again but on a busier day where there is more atmosphere."
"Long walk to get to it from hotel entrance.
Beautiful interior, good friendly professional service. Strong... Long Island Ice Tea, which makes a change in the US.
Food was amazing, dim sum n Lobster soup to start.. Excellent. Had the Peking D n Caviar which was special, the pancakes a little soggy,
Short ribs yummy
Seabass a must.. Too tasty.
They have got this resto right."
The food was delicious and service was impeccable. We will definitely make it one of the restaurants we frequent when we're back again.
"Came highly recommended with reason. We asked the waiter for suggestions and had a duck salad and dim sum as starters followed by grilled duck. Everything was excellent. The wine list was not large but more than sufficient.
I one is to compare with the other competition near by there is no comparison as here you can here yourself talk and the food is more than comparable.
Will be back
If there is to be a complaint, the Fontainbleu is like Grand Central Station on an early Monday morning  except the clothing is a  lighter and the restaurant is a little hidden away."
"We brought in my husbands bday and as we are foodie family the food and the service satisfied us completely satiating our palate .would recommend a visit for sure .

"My bf and I had the vegetarian dim sum platter and it was so fresh and unique we ended up ordering a second one! The Beijing style duck can be ordered without caviar at the price if $100 but you need to ask for it as it's not written on the menu. The duck was perfectly cooked: crispy skin and tender flesh. A real treat! Expensive yes, but not that much when you deal with good Chinese food. +++"
"Our booking was for 8pm on a Saturday evening. We arrived at 7.50 and we were asked to go to the bar and told we would be called when out table was ready.
The cocktail I ordered was unavailable as they were missing an ingredient! After waiting 40 mins and checking again with reception we were eventually shown to a table! It appeared people arriving after us were shown to a table before us.
Once we were seated at 8.45 the wine we ordered but was also not available ( I also was aware that this was the case for the table next to us too)!!

We eventually ordered by 9pm!

The food was of a high standard and good quality, good atmosphere but not sure worth the wait?

There must be better Chinese restaurants on Miami Beach! Without the stress!"
"I was one of a party of 7 to eat at Hakkasan and this was certainly a good thing as this is a great ""sharing"" restaurant. The menu is comprehensive, but not too long and the wait staff are very knowledgeable and guide you smoothly through the ordering phase very well. We started with a selection of appetizers, of which the Dim Sum was simply superb, as were the barbecued ribs.
For out main courses, several dishes stood out, but the Chilean Sea Bass was simply sensational!! 

Hakkasan is a world renowned name and is Michelin starred in London, so unsurprisingly, it is not cheap, but for the quality of the food and the experience, I would still consider it an outstanding value."
"While at Fountainbleau on Business my boss had us meet for a dinner/business meeting and it was impeccable. Truly some of the best flavors, wonderful presentation, amazing all around! It is very glamorous and upscale and I am quite thankful I wasnt fitting the Bill because I could imagine that it was very pricey! IT is the perfect atmosphere for a romantic date. Even the bathrooms are something to rave about! You know its nice when the Bathrooms are amazing!

Would not hesitate to return and I highly recommend this restaurant 5 stars!"
Very glamorous restaurant with absolutely delicious foods! A fantastic place for both romantic night out or business dinner. My wife and I both were very impressed with service and all the foods we ordered. The staffs are very polite and attentive. We would love to visit again some time soon.
"Elegant, glamorous surroundings,  lovely bar area, food was delicious and the service was discreet yet attentive.Will not hesitate to visit any of their other Restaurants."
"During my stay at the Fontainebleau, we visited Hakkasan and I must say we were a bit disappointed. Being from the local area he have heard so much about the place, but we learned that some people can tend to embellish their experience. The service was great, but our problem was the food. The duck we tried had a very mucussy consistency. The flavor was good, but I felt like we were eating slimy duck. I have had duck plenty of times, and this one was ok at best. The portions were very small, especially for the price. They tend to give larger portions of veggies as a side (which are still small), than the main dish ordered. The best dish I had, which I give them credit for, was the Sea Bass. It was truly amazing. But I am sad to say, that was the best dish we ordered. Everything else on the menu was very typical of what you would find at other restaurants in Miami. I had tried a little bit of everything, since we were with a large group. If you are a man, and show up with an appetite, expect to order 2 entrees. That's what I did."
"My partner and I ate at Hakkasan on Saturday night and had an extremely good meal. 

Situated at the back of Fountainebleau, you have to take an elevator up to the 4th floor. The decor is quite unique & the staff were very friendly. We were served by Daniel who was extremely knowledgable of the menu and attentive. He made suggestions, always asked how our meal was & if we needed anything else. 

We chose the duck roll, egg fried rice, satay chicken and peppered tenderloin beef which were delicious. We would definitely eat here again!"
"The food was superb, but the service was out of this world.  He always knew when to show up for what we needed.  We never had to look for the waiter."
This restaurant stood out to me as one in which quality was of the utmost importance. All of the ingredients were well thought out. I think we may have ordered just about everything on the menu and I thoroughly enjoyed all of it. Can't go wrong here - especially if you're staying at the hotel and need to simply walk downstairs to get here!
"Well worth going again and again. The Dim Sum is to die for. The hotel where it is located , Fontainebleau, is a happening in itself."
"Booked months in advance and arrived 15 mins early as requested in the confirmation email but were left waiting for over an hour whilst other customers were seated immediately.  We asked the hostess twice and were told they had a special table they'd chosen for us and it wasn't ready (yeah right), we said we'd be happy with any of the free tables we could see.

The server when we were finally seated was great, friendly and knowledgeable.  The food was very good thankfully.  You probably only need 2 main dishes between 3 but we wanted to order more so we could try a range of dishes, they were all very enjoyable as were the appetisers,  soups and dessert.  I thought the price was reasonable for the quality of the food but the delay and bad service with the hostess stops me scoring higher."
"good food and service, bit expensive but worth it.  The starters are big and the atmosphere in the restaurant very relaxed."
"This place become our favorite  restaurant to visit- when we are in Miami !  Best duck ever!!!  Dim sum is amazing, My most fav is tofu with Japanese eggplant and wild mushrooms in a clay pot !! The wine selection is  very impessive and  service is impeccable!"
"We went here for my daughter's birthday and loved it. The staff was very helpful and attentive ( too much if possible, one waiter helper stays by your table the whole time). The y explained to us, that food is brought as its cooked, and its shared.  Anyhow, it was expensive but we loved every single dish we tried. I loved the fried royal rice, dim sum platter and the venison with ginger and leek."
"Food was excellent. We had the dim sum platter, peppered tenderloin, mushroom noodles, and eggplant. The food had unique and bold flavors The bar had a large selection of alcohol with a great atmosphere. The wine selection was numerous with many rare varieties. The entrees and sides/apps are meant to be shared. It was a bit expensive-might recommend for a special occasion."
"I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here since we arrived without reservations at 1030 on a Wednesday, but still. Food was overpriced for what we received: bland & overlooked. I ordered sea bass, which I've never had a sea bass dish I didn't like, until this experience. It was overcooked and tough. I sampled my husband's dish and was underwhelmed as well. The decor and atmosphere and drinks we got at the bar while waiting for our table were all awesome so we had high hopes for the food. It just didn't pan out like that."
"I booked this in advance for my hubby's 30th birthday whilst in Miami. They fully catered for his birthday, greeting him with birthday wishes on arrival plus a birthday card - nice touch! It is a great restaurant, cool/funky décor with amazing food. They recommend you 'share' plates, so we went with the DimSum platter for starters - which was enough between 2 people and a variety of tastes. Followed by the mushroom noodles and beef/green pepper dish - it was so tasty. The server was very helpful and knowledgeable. He recommended dessert, chocolate fondant - which was amazing. I would highly recommend for a special occasion."
"I've been a regular at Hakkasan in London for a number of years as I love the place and this was my first visit to one outside the UK. 

Perhaps its just me but I was initially surprised that the menu is so different (atleast in terms of the items that I usually order!). With hindsight I understand this as locally sourced ingredients are usually the best. One dish that is in common with my London dishes was  the salt and pepper squid - and that was disappointing in Miami. I can't put my finger on why but the flavours just didnt pop as usual. The dim sum is also in common and in Miami is double the size of the London dish - and tasted as good. Otherwise I had the crispy duck salad (excellent), garlic and chili lobster (I would actually recommend this) and the crispy Szechun beef (rather disappointing as it wasn't crispy at all but was rather limp and wasn't that spicy). 

While the service was very good, i found it amazing that the place lacked a buzz (atleast they'd turned the music down as this is often overkill in Hakkasans). Perhaps it's because the restaurant is located so far from the main lobby of the hotel, because the bar is usually kicking from what I've experienced in London and read about other locations. 

Overall it was good and I'm glad I went but I was a bit underwhelmed."
"The portions were too big and lacked flavour! The hot and sour soup (I think) was neither. The lobster was over cooled and the waiter did that really annoying thing over filling your wine glad in order to make you drink more!

The original in london is the best by far!"
The service was outstanding. The food was even better. Very romantic and posh environment. Appetizers and entrees are perfect for sharing. Definitely a must when staying at Fontaineblue.
"We enjoyed a fabulous dim sum meal here in May 2014.  All the food was wonderfully seasoned & tasted very fresh.  This is a AAA 4-Diamond award restaurant, and it shows why.  If you like Chinese food & are nearby, this is a great place to dine."
"Hakkasan was so great we had to eat here twice during our week long stay.  

Service was perfect.

Notable:

Wild mushroom pulled noodles, crispy duck salad (so good), wicked martini.

Just as good as hakkasan NYC"
"Hey to me, this place was just meh. Maybe we didn't order the right stuff but the food was average.

The best part is the decor. I loved all the black lacquered doors. I believe this place is more about the scene than the food."
"My wife and I tried Hakkasan for the first time during our most recent visit to South Beach. We usually eat only at SoBe restaurants when we stay there, but we heard good things about Hakkasan, so we ventured out of SoBe to give it a try.

Overall, we enjoyed the experience. There are lots of interesting items on both the food and drink menu (it was hard to decide). The food was very good, the ambiance and decor were very cool, and the service was great. The price was a bit high for what you get -- you're paying a premium for eating at the Fontainebleau.

For cocktails, we both ordered the Far East Margarita, which was really good and really spicy. For starters we shared the Jasmine Tea Soaked Beef Short Rib -- it was very tasty, but it was served on the bone and very fatty, so we didn't enjoy it as much as we might have otherwise. For entrees, we shared the Stir-Fried XO Prawns with Pineapple and the Crispy Chicken with Orange Sauce, with a bowl of Jasmine Rice on the side. Everything was very tasty, and the presentation for all the dishes was excellent. The portions didn't look huge, but we were full by the time we finished -- we couldn't finish the rice, and we didn't have room for dessert. Our server Antoine provided exception service throughout.

The Hakkasan is worth trying if you don't mind paying the price, and I'm glad we tried it. I don't know if we'll be back, especially since we can't walk there from SoBe, but you never know."
"What a beautiful restaurant. The bar is just amazingly gorgeous. The entire atmosphere was so comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable, but no surprise there it is located in the Fountainbleu hotel. The food is just amazingly delicious!!!!"
"Visited Hakkasan for dinner. Wonderful atmosphere, absolutely delicious food, excellent service! It was pricey but worth it. Would definitely go back."
"Me and my wife went here having being told by a friend about it , on our arrival we where a little early so we where taken to the bar and it was buzzing really good atmosphere , we where shown to our table really nice setting the waitress was very nice and attentive the food was excellent and served perfectly in all a fantastic night , a must if in Miami"
"Wonderful atmosphere, absolutely delicious food and beverages, and excellent service.  I would eat here again and again!"
"Maybe because we are just jaded Asian food eaters/lovers, we were just not overly impressed with the foods there. No complain about the service and the cocktails, but the foods are just kind of disappointing in a non-creative American Chinese food way. We can imagine many people may like it as they are very well made American Chinese foods with rather fresh gradients that aim to please Americans. However, with such a strong reputation and a pretty high price point, we expect something more creative and savory and a little less conforming. So here is the bottom line in our opinion, if you travel extensively in Asian countries (China in this case) and enjoy local authentic cuisine, or even if you just stick with Chinatown in NYC, LA and Boston or many eateries all over in Vancouver, then you will likely find this place disappointing. Ambiance aside, you can have a better meal for a portion of the price in many other places. If eating Peking roasted duck and silver ear fungus soup are considered adventurous by you and you want an expensive place to have some cocktails and American Chinese foods, then give this place a try."
"Great chinese cuisine, would highly recommend! We liked it so much we visited twice during a one week holiday."
"We ate at the bar because the wait for the dining room as too long.  Ordered the smokey negroni  cocktail to start ... very dramatic preparation and presentation.  Food is creative and high quality but plenty of approachable items for the less adventurous diners.  Be prepared to pay, however.  Like most top dining spots in Miami Beach, the prices are steep.  In this case, however, it was worth it.  Will definitely go back on a future trip."
"Loved the ambiance, view of the bar from our table and the food was delicious! We dined on the dim sum, orange chicken, chinese vegetables and rice which was very tasty."
"We visited Hakkasan for my fiancé's birthday. I booked a table via email and only mentioned the birthday, yet when we arrived there was a card on the table just for him! Our server was helpful and attentive, but not pushy, and our food was delicious. We had the vegetarian dumplings, ginger plum salad, udon noodles with duck and the braised tofu. Everything was prepared perfectly and they even brought us a complimentary dessert with a candle for our birthday celebration. Add all this to the very cool decor and vibe and we will definitely be back!"
"Fantastic food, be careful when you order, don't be embarrassed to ask what stuff costs.  If you let the waiter do the ordering you will have a $500.00 bill on your hands for two people."
"Food, atmosphere and service all top notch.  Went for dinner, which was a bit pricey, but I understand there is a more affordable dim sum lunch available."
"Enjoyed a delicious dim sum bday lunch.  It's definitely not your typical dim sum, a bit more sophisticated.  It's pre fixed menu for $28/person so you get what they serve.  It was a good variety meat, vegetable, fried, steamed items. and I was stuffed by the time we left.  My absolute favorite was the pumpkin dish.  

They also gave me a nice bday fruit dessert with a candle.
It's also a perk that it's at the Fontainebleau and you get to walk through the hotel.  
Valet parking was $12 with validation."
"Exquisitely prepared Chinese..sumptuous, attentive service beautiful ambiance, priced for the ""1%percent"" to enjoy. Located in the very beautiful very pretentious Fountainebleu Hotel. Must valet park to eat here,  add $12 with restaurant validation. $24 without"
"Very cool atmosphere.  We had a reservation but decided to sit at the bar instead.  The craft cocktails were well done.  The dumpling appetizer was recommended and they were all awesome.  We also did fried rice and orange chicken.  Both were great.  It is definitely more expensive than your average Chinese restaurant, but the quality and spin on the dishes make it worth it."
"This was the best Asian food that I ever had, except perhaps in San Francisco.  The atmosphere is good as is the service.  It was pricey but worth it."
"For the real dim sum I'd recommend NYC's China town, ten times better and much cheaper.  If you are from Manhattan, you will be disappointed here.

With that said, their roasted duck was exquisite and in retrospect I should have only ordered that and skipped the other small plates.

It does have a cool vibe, feel to it. Very swank, posh and upscale.  2 stars may be a little harsh, I'd give this place 2.5 all together (Service was a bit messy too)."
My husband and I had a fabulous meal at Hakkasan. When we lived in London (for ten years) we used to go regularly for lunch and miss it greatly. Miami didn't disappoint - although the decor wasn't quite as fabulous as London. A great meal.
"First time visitor to Hakkasan, and would love to go again. The restaurant is very cool, with lots of small areas divided off by Chinese style screens. The service was friendly and helpful, which is not always the case in these sorts of places, and the menu was extensive with plenty of great options. 
We had a 5 dishes between 2 people, which was plenty. Star of the show was the duck salad, which was out of this world. Szechuan beef was also really flavoursome, and we also had salt and pepper squid (less impressive) and the biggest scallops I have ever seen! They were the size of a tennis ball! Noodles completed the meal, and with a couple of drinks and a dessert to share, the bill was just shy of $200. 
Then, of course there is the obligatory service charge, which at 18% is a bit of a shock to us British people who are used to 12% maximum. Still, service was good, so no real issues. Would recommend for a special occasion."
"Hakkasan was the food highlight of our stay at the Fontainbleu. I loved the dark decor and the very cool bar. It was entertaining to watch these talented bartenders at work making their fantastic and unusual cocktails. We had dinner the first night and our outstanding servers made excellent suggestions including the dim sum platter, which was SO GOOD as well as some delicious entrees and a really nice sake.  We returned for the bar the next night of our stay and again for the prix fix dim sum lunch on the weekend. Have now found out that there are several of these restaurants in some major cities and would search them out for another experience with such great food and drink."
"Excellent food and ambience, and although very pricey (you can eat at some local Chinese restaurants for cheaper than the $12 it costs to park here) our group of 4 loved it. The ambience and service are outstanding. The only menu item I didn't like was the quail, but we knew it would be a bit skimpy by default. All the other items we ordered were nice portions and easily shared (3 appetizers, 2 entrees, a rice dish and a delicious eggplant dish) which kept the price down somewhat. We'll be back."
"Visited Hakkasan for a late dinner. Food was excellent, service very good and the setting is beautifully done. Would definitely go back."
"The food a Hakkasan was as good as any meal I have had during extensive trips in China!  The food is well presented, prepared with care and elegance, and the tastes are excellent.  Prices tend to be high- but after all, this is Miami Beach, what do you expect?  On the evening my wife and I were there we were served by a waitress from Paris.  Interesting -  eating Chinese food, in Miami and speaking French to our server!  Only in America."
"HAKKASAN has a great reputation and exceeded it! The decor, service, food presentation and taste……..just simply as good as it gets and the prices while certainly not cheap, were pleasantly affordable for this quality. Can't wait to return. One suggestion, when you are seated, look around to ensure you are not facing a bank of colourful computers!"
"We went for Brunch and had the prix fix ""dim-sum"".  The presentation is beautiful!  The food was Amazing !!  Service was good, not great.  We were not having alcoholic drinks, maybe that is why our server was not to interested . . . . . .Drinks are VERY expensive.  But overall a really great brunch."
"1. You have to come very early unless you want your conversation drowned out by horrible outdated loungy club music.
2. You have to either be pretentious or not mind pretension.
3. You have to know what to order.
The cocktails are fabulous: Chinese Mule and Hakka are my favorites. For starters, almost everything is good: wild mushrooms, duck salad, hot and sour soup, tea smoked ribs, most of the dim sum (some are blah). For mains, our favorite is one of the cheapest: the Mabo Tofu. Our waiter did not like that that was all we ordered, bad style. It's fabulous and flavorful at $22 bucks and can be split by two people with rice. Crispy duck is also very good, as are many other dishes like the szechuan chicken. You don't have to go all out here, many mains are in the 20-dollar range and are excellent.
Again, prepare for awful and awfully loud music after 8 pm, rip-off service, pretentious yet somewhat moody decor -- but we go every time we are in Miami, we come at 6 pm, eat Tofu and some other things, and take off! It's worth it."
"We enjoyed dinner here on a Saturday evening before a concert at Bleaulive and were very pleasantly surprised.  (The dinner was part of the concert package and Hakkasan reservations were the only ones left when we purchased, so we were leery we may have gotten the lesser of the four Fountainebleau restaurants.)  The salad, appetizers (wrapped prawns, short ribs), main courses (chicken with hot peppers, fish, and bok choi), and desert (Chocolate volcano) were each very good.  Service was excellent; the only hiccup was a missed order of coffee at the end of the meal, but it arrived with much concern and was comped as a result.  Really a nice experience and nice dinner."
"This is one of the best Asian restaurants I have ever been to. Had a great diner with a weatlth of small dishes, everything cooked to perfection, whether meat, fish or chicken. Good selection of wines. Very good service, keeping a close eye without being intrusive. Definitely worth a visit."
If you are looking for a good Asian food. That's the place. You can eat both Japanese and Chinese. Staff are very friendly and the service is close to perfection
"Wow what a way to spend Chinese New Year. We stood in the bar and shared a drink while we waited for our table. The food and room are so wonderful the guests do not want to leave. 
Every dish was perfect but I loved the duck and when the asparagus dish arrived every spear had been peeled. 
They have a nice wine list and the server was great at offering suggestions. The three of us shared 5 dishes and of course a little dish of coconut ice cream. 
Worth spending time in the hotel lobby just to people watch."
"Today we received the best service of our life!! The food, atmosphere, were the highlights of our vacation. The restaurant was busy, so is our server Ken. But talk about multitasking!! He gave us amazing service, great recommendations, was very professional. 
Great spot to remember!! Might be pricy for your wallet, but so worth it!"
"We had the prix fixe brunch ($28 per person in Jan.2014), and thought it was a great meal, a great deal, and a really pleasant experience. The very friendly and helpful wait staff explained what we'd get (a good variety of dim sum and vegetables) and when I wanted to add to the order, our waitress said we might want to wait - it might be too much food! I did get the chicken and spinach congee - a wonderful comfort food you can jazz up with hot stuff - and it was almost too much. Almost made me miss the dessert - which would have been a shame - it was molten chocolate cake and espresso ice cream - an amazingly delicious end to a lovely lunch. The setting is comfortable and handsome. Definitely suggest making a reservation."
"A very classy joint, where the meat is cooked very well. The dim sum, were some of the best I had ever had, but my wife's fish was a little too soya-saucy, and could have been a lot better. I've has better Chinese for the same praise or less."
"We ate here recently as a family of 4, and I have to tell you this has to be the best Asian food I have ever had!!! So many choices, all cooked to perfection. Even the noodles! There is something here for everybody.

We ordered a variety of dishes as it is a GREAT spot to share smaller plates with several people, then you get to taste more. The best dish was the Beef Short Ribs! 

Try it out....you will not be disappointed!!!"
"We adored everything about this restaurant, from the fun vibe in the bar, to the excellent menu, with lots of sharing dishes.  The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable, the decor is stunning, with lots of intimate little 'rooms' created with cutwork Asian-style panels and the music is very cool.  We ate in some amazing culinary gems in Miami, but this, for the overall experience, is the best.  Well done, Hakkasan."
"The Fontainebleau is a place to see and be seen.  The hotel was packed, as was Hakkasan.  After a drink at the bar we were seated promptly for our dinner reservation.  The waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable, making some good suggestions from the menu.  We were served promptly.  The meat on the ribs was so tender, it just fell off the bones.  The duck was cooked to perfection!  The food was delicious, but pricey for the small portions. We felt a bit rushed, as the busboy wanted to remove our plates as we were putting the last bite of food in our mouths! I guess they needed our table.  Our total bill for four was about $400, including the two glasses of wine from the bar.  I don't think any of us would go back, but it was fun to do once."
"A very dramatic interior restaurant with comfortable couches and wooden screens that divide the room. Service is outstanding. We liked the ginger chicken appetizer ($16), fried dumplings ($18), claypot chicken ($24), eggyolk scallop ($38), spring onion rice ($12) and cold Tsingtao ($7)."
"Food is delicious,definitely recommend for a fun dinner night!Place is pretty crowded, make sure to reserve in advance.We arrived at 8:30 PM for dinner and by 9 PM the place was packed.
Our waiter was extremely knowledgable and accommodating. A large menu with a lot of options and reasonable price. I will be going back !!"
The dim sum was great and so was the fried rice. But everything else...I could have made better. AND what really grinds my gears - you pay 38$ for a dish and the plain rice is not included. AND the dish is small. I would never go back and waste money there
"Celebrated New Years a few nights before that.  Wide range in menu, had lunch and dinner menu separately although incorporated dim sum into both.   Portion were small but good, quite pricey but worth trying.  Only complain is quite dark in restaurant which created difficulties in reading menu.  Would have preferred an oceanview while eating.  Had to make reservation with $100 non refundable deposit (24 hours notice if changes are required) and only hold reservation 15 minutes past reserved time.  Will validated parking, still have to pay $12 (very small compared to restaurant bill!)"
"Nice ambiance, perhaps this is what Forbidden City dining room looks like? Do not appreciate the incense in front of the restaurant, after all we are going to restaurant, not temple. We order fix prix dim sum. Snobbish servers, beautiful presentation; for the taste, some dim sum are passable, the others (stir fry baby bok choy, shumai, sweet potato mini pumpkin) are good to excellent. Come for presentation, high price and pretentious, one won't be disappointed. Oh, they also add 18% tips for their minimal service. For taste, go to chinatown any day (we are from southern CA, not certain if there is Chinatown in Miami or surrounding area)."
"The best Chinese food I have had in years.  Expensive restaurant, but the fixed price lunch was only $28."
"If you want to see fancy people and eat Chinese food, better to order take out and watch Access Hollywood 

We had late night reservations and were rushed because the kitchen closes within 30 min  of our  arrival. Which we were constantly reminded of, once we sat down. 

So, for fast Chinese I would have preferred to stay home and have take out"
"This place could be on top of its pretention. Unfortunately it seems that its success reduces quality and attention. Decor is ok, but as you sit in small secluded areas there's no real buzz, and takes away from the charm to be in 'a want to be trendy' place. Music is loud, lights are dim ... (has been a trend). Food is ok, but nothing spectacular."
"Food is very good but by the time you order enough dishes for dinner it will turn out to be an expensive proposition. Even with the discount coupon provided on check-in, dinner for 2 with a modest bottle of wine will easily take you to $250 once the 18% service charge is added on."
"Great new experinece after all Japanese fusion its time for Chinese fusion and it was extremly good, relatively expensive but definitly worth it, we had started , main course and deset with White and red wine, 340 USD for 3 persons.

Service was great and quick alos the food came in fast"
"After having great expectations i found this place to be a little Blah. Yes, the duck and noddles i tried are great, but i ordered a few other dishes and found them to be a little bland and lacking on flavor. It was a nice dinner experience, the ambiance is very trendy, the dish presentations were great and the desserts were the highlight of the meal! Amazing desserts! 
Many people might consider it the best, i was not particularly blown away by any dish but the desserts. It is nevertherless, worth visiting to enjoy a trendy night with friends"
"We first tried Hakkasan when we were in London, England and it was amazing so really wanted to try it in Miami Beach.  We had the Miami spice menu that they were offering and it was great for the value.  If there's one thing on the menu that is a must, the duck salad, ordered that as well with the spice menu and it was spectacular."
First walking in to this place is life changing. The decor is awesome yet quaint. you don't even realize how big it actually is. the food is next to perfect and the specialty drinks here are unique and delicious!
"Ridiculous food and cool spot for drinks, great spot for dinner to drinks night without getting too crazy!!!"
"Great decor and ambience for a special (and pricey) evening. The location (Fontainebleau Resort close to South Beach), delicious food, presentation and service is worth the extra bucks if budget is not an issue...It's great to have an upscale option for Chinese cuisine rather than the usual less than inspiring neighborhood joint. Be sure not to miss the tea smoked sea bass if on the menu. Very lively bar scene will keep you entertained while waiting for your table."
"You can definitely get wrapped up in the hype and the vibe.  Seven of us went ans while we enjoyed the food, it wasn't worth the bill.  And the server was over the top trying to push a ""chef's selection"" on us which I am sure would have been even more expensive.  I'd go to say you've been but I would not go a second time."
"We had this recommended to us by someone who travels a lot and stays at this hotel every year.  We almost didnt go because we were tired on the last night of our trip but very glad we did.  We ate less than usual but I ended up asking the waiter ""what is that"" about people near us as they got their food about every single item that came because it all looked great.  We had Dim Sum and it was incredible.  So were our scallops that we had difficulty choosing between the 3 kinds they have.  So many other things looked great, you could eat here a bunch and try many things which you can share with the table.  I would guess a decent amount of the items would be relatively healthy besides tasting phenomenal too which doesnt happen often."
An amazing place with great service and good value for money. We ordered the lunch prix fixe menu together with an extra order of almond taro puff and panfried foie gras shanghai dumplings. The almond taro puff is the bestdimsum i've tried. And for $28pp the lunch prix fixe menu is more than enough food to fill a hungry tummy. The ambience was great and romantic. The restrooms were very clean.
"I've visited once with friends and had an absolutely great meal. All the apetizers and the main dishes were outstanding. Very tasty, just the right textures, no fancy presentation. The duck was superb as was the spicey beef. The orange chicken was also a hit. Service is professional but not uptight. This one is a doer. Enjoy."
"Great Chinese cuisine, with all the stuff that I love, Sweet & Sour Pork, Crispy Roast Chicken, my husband enjoyed the Steamed red snapper. Very lively atmosphere, and good service."
I came here with my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary dinner before we headed out to LIV nightclub which is right inside the same hotel. The hostesses were rude and the management seemed stuffy. The food was mediocre and overpriced. My boyfriend enjoyed their duck but I didn't like it very much. I would not recommend this place unless you want to spot someone famous and be broke by the end of the evening. It's just Ok.
"I think our dinner at Hakkasan may have been the best taste-bud experience we have ever had.  Add on to that the superb atmosphere and service, and it is hard to imagine a better dinner experience.  We had two appetizers – ribs and seafood dim sum – plus orange chicken and an order of mushroom noodles.  All were absolutely amazing, particular the dumplings.  Even their sorbet is spectacular.  Wine prices were quite reasonable as was the entire fare.  This was our first visit, and we will certainly return, as well as seeking out its sister restaurant in NYC when we go there."
"I had reserved a table for a bachelorette party on a friday night, and Maria took amazing care of us.  We had 8 girls at the table and she was on her game! One of the girls was gluten intolerant, another only ate white meat, and Maria was able to recommend dishes that wow'd both girls!  I highly suggest the Hakka, this drink is absolutely delicious, and all the food that hit the table was on point.  We had such a great night, I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic atmosphere and delightful cuisine."
All I can say is you have to go.  It is a fun and vibrant place with quite a unique menu and excellent service.  Our party of 10 had a fantastic evening!
"I really enjoyed the gai lan and noodles 
my hubby had the duck rolls and duck breast 
I would definitely return"
"Enjoyed a great seafood meal with a modern Chinese touch.
Good atmosphere despite being in a hotel.
Very friendly service."
"It was my first time here and as a resident of Miami and San Juan, we know good food. This place impressed me for the menu, but the quality of food for the price was very disapointing. Service and ambiance was simply average considering its Miami Beach. Tip is always included in Miami beach so waiters sometimes forget to gave the extra mile. We had the Black truffle Duck ($60) plate to share and to tell you the truth you can get better Duck plate at PF changs for a good $20. The vegetable fried rice was ok, not outsanding like the waiter sold it to us. I would not come here again. If I pay $260 for a dinner for 2 at least I expect to have a unforgettable dinning/tasting experience."
"This was 1 of 7 Miami gourmet restaurents that I visited during the recent Miami Spice promotion, which allowed you to have a sensational dinner (for only$39.99 per couple) at a myriad # of fine restaurents. The food, service, and ambiance was impeccable. A ""must eat at"""
They went over and beyond our expectations. We went to the club in Vegas so wasn't sure what to expect but it was awesome. I love when you get high end hospitality and Hakkasan has that down. They made us feel like celebrities! I recommend this place over and over again.
"The best duck I ate in intire world, and a ate ducks in Paris, Viena, Praga, Alemanha, Austria, Praga, ..."
"we went to Hakkasan new york and now we are in miami, their menus are different which is great.
The taste of most of the dashes is quite authentic and yummy. It is a decent Chinese restaurant.

We ordered the lobster with chive which I enjoyed it very much. It was overall a pleasant dining experience.

I still prefer to o there for lunch instead of dinner because of the atmosphere, but evenings are great if you are into more of a bar scene."
"Similar to the resort that is hosting Hakkasan, this place takes benefit from the hype around Fontainebleau. The staff at Hakkasan, however, are still top notch and they have managed to preserve the key attitudes when you want your clients to leave their place with a smile: humility and understated friendliness. The food was great and as such they would actually deserve an 'excellence' in rating. That said, IMHO the prices are over the top. One example is the bottle of Domaine Ott, which was at USD 100. Another one being a plate of plane noodles for USD 28. My suggestion for the director: bring those prices down by 10% and you'll have a good chance to strive into the next five years keeping up your reputation - it'll pay back on the long run."
"I really like the food there.
Hakkasan now is in NYC and vegas too!
asian fusion restaurant .
you will not be disappointed.
portions were bigger than expected."
"The place is really nice, not your average restaurant.
The food is very good, again not the average asian, chinese food.
I agree that it is overpriced.
Overall it was a good experience and would recommend it."
"Wow. Cannot understand how this place has gotten so highly rated. The food is good to very good Chinese food. But not exciting and not creative. It's also way over-priced. A good example is Szechuan beef for $38. It's pretty good but the same dish at P.F Changs is less than half the price, twice as much food and tastes better.  NOTHING we ate was excellent, but everything was good.  The service WAS wonderful  and the sommelier steered us to a great, unique wine.
If it was half as expensive I would have said that it was very good solid Chinese , but a little pricey.  Was really disappointed at how un-imaginative the food was."
"Great atmosphere, great food. Went with a group of 15. We were well looked after by the staff. We couldn't be bothered to work our way through the menu so they just brought us a feast of culinary finery and great wine. Amazing. A must do if in Miami"
"OMG!...the best Asian meal ever.  Chef Kenny is the best, wow he really out do himself.  Our meal was a exquisite, delicious and mouth watering.  In my party there was three birthday girls and we enjoyed the special treat.  Our server Steven made our time enjoyable, he is fun to be around with and made the service flawless.  It was priceless to see my mom enjoy her 74 birthday and the special treat she had experienced.  The perking duck was delicious, as well as the rest of our meal and the best surprise our dessert wording ""happy birthday""."
I had called prior to let staff know we were celebrating a special occasion. Upon arrival they sat us immediately and had a card waiting with champagne! What else can I say.
Great ribs and dim sum but dont come for sushi..they dont have it here.  Great atmosphere for romantics!
"We were a party of 6 and were warmly welcomed from the valet to the server presenting the check. The restaurant is beautiful, the drinks were delicious and the food was exceptional. We ordered an a la carte pi pa duck, in addition to the Miami spice menu, and it was photo worthy.

Very long walk from the valet for one of our party but he managed it.

Will definitely return for the regular menu during the coming months. Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Just came from the restaurant... The service was excellent!  Would definitely come back again...
I do not usually order from the Miami Spice menu, but was very surprised how great it was..."
"I have no words to descrive the night at Hakkasan Miami, firts impression was absolutely a no charming place, and chinese food at caviar price. Located in the most famous Hotel in Miami, to reach the door wasen,t easy, too far from valet parking!!!
But wen you get in! And Maitew wellcomes you, all you have to do is relax and enjoy the night. Terrific 9 course menu, impossible tomchoose my favorite dish, sure the wine list at the same scale, plenty of nice options to be oppened, and we order a fantastic Rias Baixas, who match with the food as We can never imagin. Mr sumiller told us to pick this wine because he love people drink something familiar if they are eating under his guide. Just dreaming with my Pekin Duck with Caviar...."
"We made reservations for 11 people to visit this restaurant for a special occasion.  As someone who has lived in Miami for 6 years, I enjoy dining out at upscale restaurants and have definitely had my fair share of experiences, both good and bad and this one was horrible! Here's why:

When we arrived, the table was set for 9 (reservation for 11).  They were able to add 2 more chairs which made the table over-crowded and one guest had to sit on the corner of the table.  The food menus were raggedy, stained and falling apart and had no description of what anything was.  The service started out okay and food/drinks were ordered. The server was able to give a good description of the choices and helped make some recommendations.  When the food came, it was mediocre at best, but definitely not worth the costs.  We ordered a plethora of options and shared between smaller groups at the table and everyone pretty much had the same opinion.  

At one point, a bottle of wine was ordered and the server asked for clarification as to which we wanted, so we pointed to it on the menu.  They brought out a different bottle (a $110 up-charge, I might add!) and since the guest who ordered the bottle was in the restroom at the time, it was presented to someone else at the table for approval.  There was some discrepancy as to which bottle was ordered and there was never a mention of the cost difference and we were charged for it!  After attempting to politely speak with the server and manager, they were rude, accusatory and pointed the blame on us--something that you should NEVER do in a customer service industry.  At one point the server was actually raising his voice at us and ended up storming off.  Their excuse for no mention of the cost difference was that they didn't want to ""assume"" that we would want to know the price and embarrass us, as they claim they have done with guests in the past.  A simple solution to this for next time: Bring over the drink menu and clarify one more time, which bottle we wanted.  As I mentioned before, I had pointed to the drink of choice on the menu when I had originally ordered.  When I mentioned this to the server, stating there should have been no mistake due to this, his excuse was that I was on the other side of the table and he could not see what I pointed to!!!  In the end, the manager ""graciously"" took off $36 which was hardly comparable to the $110 difference.  Needless to say, I will NOT be back here and do not recommend it to anyone looking for ""upscale asian"".  There are plenty of other restaurants within this hotel that surpass the food and service of this place."
I usually never give bad reviews but in this case I must! The atmosphere is great but then it stops there. We had there and our food wasn't to our standards. The pork was fatty and the manager acknowledged it asked if we wanted them to remake it we said no we were turned off to it and that was it! She never returned and it was still on our bill. Two of the couples in our party of six owns resturants and they said that pork should never be served like that! The desert was the only thing served to us that we felt was great!
Very nice restaurant with a good menu.The food is tasty but a little overpriced. We will not run to be back.
"Great food and good, relaxed atmosphere. Everything from starter to dessert was a new experience. Try the summer menu which has good value for the money."
"During our weekend escape to South Beach we encountered this restaurant inside the Fontainebleau Miami Beach. We made reservations and dined there one afternoon. It is a little pricey, but the food is very well prepared and tasty. Excellent service, very upscale.
Worth your money. Mango Dessert was to die for. Highly recommended."
"Located in the famous Fontainebleau hotel, we visited hakkasan as it was within walking distance of our hotel - circa 39 on Collins. The menu ranges from standard Miami beach prices to very expensive, however we were pleasantly surprised to choose from a Miami spice menu which is a pre-fix menu many restaurants in Miami offer throughout August & September (presumably cause its low season). Service, presentation & food was excellent & with 4 courses offered for $39pp it was a steal. Decor was high end & very stylish as are most places in Miami. Worth a look see!"
"During our recent trip to South Florida we encountered this restaurant in Miami Beach and since we enjoy very much Dim Sam we made reservations and dined there one afternoon. Even though it is a little pricey, the food is very well prepared and tasty. Worth your money.

Highly recommended."
"Dishes are served ""family style"" so you order a rice/noodle, meat dish, veggie. We had the claypot chicken, dumplings, bok choy and veggie rice. All very excellent and delicious! Drinks were awesome and take pics by the bar!!! Thier decor is awesome!"
"I do not believe I am a difficult person when it comes to restaurants, however, I must say this is one of the worst dining experience I had in a long time. 

The decor and atmosphere at the restaurant is great when you walk in. The music is loud and there is a dj on site, which I guess is part of the ""ambience""

The reason why I say it was a bad dining experience is first: the service. Our waiter, Nick, was the rudest person I have encountered in a restaurant. Maybe it is because he was having a bad day, but wow...he should have stayed home. This is supposed to be an ""uspcale"" restaurant. You would expect to have good service. This was not the case at all. He would never come to our table, ask us if we needed anything, etc. It s really something that we have to leave an 18% tip for someone that gives us such bad service.

Secondly, the food, according to me was  average. Everything was extremely salty, and it did not taste like authentic chinese food. I have read a few reviews on this site and everyone seems to think that the food is amazing. I personally did not like it. 

I would not go back to this restaurant next time I am in Miami."
"The restaurant is beautiful, winding around with rooms.  The waitstaff were very professional.  The food was excellent.  We had the short ribs which were so tender they fell off the bone.  For the main course, we had lemon chicken, but the breading was a bit doughy (it tasted a bit like a donut).  The friend rice and stir fry veggies were full of flavor.  For dessert, we had panna cotta, and it was perfect texture and flavor.  They have a nice wine list.  Overall great meal!"
"Beautiful place whith supreme food and perfect service ! ...... What else can I say more ? Also my husband who usually doesn't like to try asiatic food was enthusiastic !,"
Food was excellent and fresh. The experience was great! I didn't mind when I saw the check. It was worth it! Delicious!
We ate here for my daughters 21st.  I hate Chinese food - but I loved this.  Everything was prepared to perfection and tasted delicious. We were all very happy and the bill was not at all what I expected.  All round brilliant.
"We had dinner there before going to LIV. The bar was the perfect place to wait for our table and we wouldn t mind waiting a little longer but in 10m we were taken to our table.
the food is a nice cantonese mix...we would recommend the Wok-friend udon with duck in X.O. sauce. only downside was the wine that we had was the last bottle from that reference..."
"Perfect. Food, service and ambience. Not as expensive like London venues and almost as good. All dishes were delicious"
"Had dim sum for lunch. Delicious and very exquisite. Definitely Chinese fine dining. I'm Malaysian Chinese. Trust me on this. You will not regret it. Mango custard to die for too. Beautiful space and deco, attentive service. Not your typical dim sum restaurant."
"Too much hype about this place. The decoration is very original. The ambiance is very cool. The food was just ok. We did not get the Miami Spice special but a la Carte. A la carte is extemelly expensive considering what you get in terms of quality, flavours and size portion since the main dishes are very small considering that you order to share."
Loved the food!!! The setting and atmosphere was great as well. Staff were extremely pleasant/ Thank You Mr Eddy ;)/. What you expect from a fine dining place
Loved the appetizers.Service was great. Thanks to Russell Karath for his special dessert treat. We loved being at Hakkasan. The environment was great server was very friendly and the manager was very polite.
Very unique flavors. Had red snapper and Chilean sea bass. The Dim sum appetizers were incredible.  Always a pleasure to return.
"The atmosphere and service here were average.  Not bad, just nothing special.  The food however was excellent.  We started off with a cocktail.  My bellini was good and my boyfriend's cocktail (---- Collins?) was very tasty, light and refreshing.  The dim sum platter was delicious with an interesting variety.  My Sancerre was perfect and went really well with my scallops and mushrooms.  Both of which were done perfectly.  My boyfriend's beef and green peppers were fine, not too exciting.  The mango custard dessert was excellent.  Yum!  Would definitely go back!"
The girls and Ishowed up for a 8PM reservation for 4 people and waited for alnost an hour. Food was avarage and not worth the price.
"The food is exquisite, the service is great, the ambience has a good vibe, the huge choice of Saki's is incredible."
"Expectation for haute cuisine regrettably falls short of the mark. There are dishes that are exceptional juxtaposed with poorly developed cuisine. There are too many gaps - that you are not sure when the next dish comes, just how well it would be. The concept is there, the restaurant doesn't get there."
"We had the Miami Spice menu which was copious and very good. The mango dessert was to die for. Very expensive if you go for the regular menu.

Long wine list, most of them very expansive. A sparkling wine would have been good but they had only champagne, which is too expansive. We had the cheapest wine on the list, a Trocken Riesling that was excellent and went well with the food.

Atmosphere is so so with dark panels and modern music, although my wife liked it.. No outside view. Soft chinese music would have been desirable.

Service attentive without being intrusive

You get a coupon for the  valet parking,but it  still cost you $12 !"
"I wouldn't drink too much that day, so I started with a fresh applejuice, I didn't know it could be so tasteful, so perfect.
We had the lunch menu, wonderful, unexpected. Some great wines by the glass.
I surely come back"
"Very nice chinese restaurant in Miami. Fontainebleau is not as good was in the past, but HAKKASAN is a very good spot to eat a great chinese food. Try the crispy duck with black truffle and the rose wine LE DOMAINE. Definitely a meal to remember!"
Delicious food and a great service. Daniels scallop and desert recommendations were great and he took pictures of the family. Pricey but with it
This is my second visit to Hakkasan (first at the London location) and this location is just as fabulous and trendy.  The service was impeccable and the food was outstanding.  It is worth the splurge!
"We arrived with very high expectations at Hakkasan after reading many favorable reviews on TA.  We love Chinese food and have had some good experiences in Miami (surprisingly)...Mr Chow, even PF Changs we liked.  

In my view this was a very overrated experience.  Lets start with the room.  After seeing very cool pictures of the place we were prepared for a very hip Chinese experience.  Literally when we entered the place we asked, ""where is the rest of the place?""  The person that photographed the place is worthy of a 5 star rating, because the reality of the place was totally different than depicted in the photos.  Much smaller than it seemed in the pictures.  We were excited to sit by the bar and watch the crowd...what a disappointment.  It started from the guy in flip flops (at dinner) and shorts by our side.  The bar which looked cavernous in the pictures, had at most 15 places by the bar.  

The food was forced.  Trying to be too creative and the execution left a lot to be desired.  We sampled 7 dishes to get a flavor for the menu.  Not one worth mentioning.   

Our server was uninterested and not very prepared to serve.  

There aren't  many other options for Chinese in Miami, but this is not the answer.  

Let me know if this review was helpful.  Thanks"
"The service and way we where taken care of - impressive. One of the best Peking ducks I have had. It was expensive, but good. The red snapper was another highlight, highly recommended. I will come back."
"We were very impressed by the whole experience! The food was amazing, the service excellent, the restaurant looks great! Thank you so much!
Thank you Emmy for your hospitality !!!"
"Food was excellent staff was wonderful wish I had time to go back.
5 star all the way. Atmosphere was authentic."
This food was so good. The service was quick even with a very packed restaurant. Where do I begin try everything . The baby bok Choy was so good. The ambiance is contemporary butbasian . The cocktails were also very good. The table shared a peeking duck and pancakes. Expensive but worth every dollar
"Its not as good as the one in London but its close enough,
Culinary very modern extremely refine taste and very comfortable and pleasant for its customers.
But there's a leak in its service they need better training, but other then that still at tops.

If your staying in the hotel make sure u go to LIV.
And if u parker your car in vallet make sure u sit down, it might take awhile according to how many persons are there"
The atmosphere was incredible! Beautiful! Wonderful wonderful food! We really enjoyed the interior design.  This is a place I would recommend.
"We arrived early and sat at the bar for a few cocktails. The barman was great and one of the servers saw us taking photos and came over to take a few of us together which was really nice!

I can't remember our servers name but she was great fun and so friendly! We chose a bottle of wine from the menu which they didn't have in stock - straight away their wine expert came over and helped us choose another bottle :)

The food was really good and the wine was perfect. Will definitely be back!"
"Food, service and hospitality were wonderful.  Our server Steve was very accommodating and we truly had a delightful evening.  Food is well served (chopsticks available) and delicious."
"It was terrific. Very cool setting in the Fontainebleau. The menu offers lots of different items and I did want to be adventurous. Great waiter. Duck salad, lemon chicken, fried rice, duck with truffles. If only I could have had a doggy bag but it wouldn't do us much good in our hotel. The bar is also really cool looking with a very interesting water like background -- ever changing. Wonderful evening and fun to try Chinese not as a cheap buffet."
Ate here this past weekend. Had a spicy chicken dish and rice. It was really good. I'm very picky with food and loved this meal!
"The minute you step out of the elevator, you know you're in a very special place.  The incense, decor, and friendly receptionists set the stage for the incredible food to follow.  The servers are knowledgeable and helpful in making recommendations. We had dinner one night, and went back the next day for the best Dim Sum I've ever eaten."
"Good restaurant especially by miami standards. Not as good as sister one in London. Black cod excellent as usual, and dumplings too. Can be pricey. Nice bar."
"What a terrific place. We have eaten Chinese food all over the world but NEVER like this. Very different, very gourmet and very tasty. I doubt that there is a bad dish on the menu. You are encouraged to share dishes of food and that is what we did.

My wife and I shared three main dished for our dinner. Based upon a TripAdvisor’s recommendation we had the Wild Mushroom Hand Pulled Noodles ($17). In addition, a Stir-fried X.0. Prawn with Pineapple dish ($36) and lastly Sautéed Diced Chicken with Dried Chili in ‘Szechuan’ style ($22). The waitress informed us that the dishes would arrive at our table in the order in which they were prepared. We got the impression that the dinners would be served over an extended period of time. They were not, arriving within a minute of each other. That was OK with us. We dug in.

Terrific flavors, a great meal. An AAA Four Diamond restaurant and it deserves it. No competition."
"We made a reservation for 8pm weeks in advance, however when we got to the restaurant we were told our table wasn't ready.  We were eventually seated at 8.30pm after a drink at the bar, which was disappointing as they seem to over book the restaurant.  Considering the prices you would expect to be seated at the time of your reservation and we weren't the only people this happened to.  However, the food and cocktails were delicious.  Between two we shared one starter and three main dishes which was more than enough.  The food is expensive but the portions are large.  The atmosphere and decor were very impressive."
"I was really looking forward to eating here for some time.  I came with  my husband and another couple.  We were seated in the same room with a large family that had 5 kids.  Definitely a mistake!!!! We should have immediately asked to move, but we did not.
As for the food, very small portions and very high $$$$.  The food wasn't bad ,but overall totally not worth it.
Sorry!!"
"Hakkassan was reommeded to us and wow are we happy we took advice.

The menu is varied,something for everyone and the idea of sharing the dishes enables you to taste more dishes.
The best dessert I have eaten in years,called Mango Custard is a MUST.Smooth and refreshing with a combination of sweet,citrus and coconut.

Would definitely return when in Miami again.

Must book in advance.
Prices above average, but then so is the service and food.
A special thanks to DANIEL B,who smoothed over a rough servicing start,where they could not find our booking and then kept us waiting for 20 minutes plus....

Anyway it was worth the wait.
HSM"
"Great food, decor, cool French DJ spinning the tunes, good barman. Could use a bit more knee room at the bar but I'm just being picky."
Stopped in for appetizers at the bar during our recent stay. High energy music and ambiance. Enjoyed the veggie dim sum...different...and the crispy duck salad. Would return for dinner.
"The restaurant Hakkasan, located in the Fontainebleau Hotel, was a very pleasant surprise.... Really original Asian recipes in a wide variety of small plates that were among the best I have had anywhere.   I recommend Hakkasan as worthwhile even when one isn't staying at the hotel."
"The restaurant is placed on the second floor of The Fontainebleau Miami Beach Hotel, very cozy but very overpriced. The fact that they have a Japanese name and serve Chinese food in a Miami Hotel should tip you off that this is not going to go well.  I've spent over a year in China: some of the food is good but it definitely tilts towards American Chinese food (ie not authentic). The decor looks like a broadway version of a Chinese gangster restaurant or something? Trying too hard, makes me a little uncomfortable. The service was good but almost a little too precious for me. Stick to latin-influenced food in Miami!!!"
"Such a fun restaurant, feels like the set of a James Bond movie. Our server was very friendly but definitely encouraged us to order a lot. Maybe that's a good thing, though, as the portions aren't so big. Really liked the hand-pulled noodles with mushrooms."
"This restaurant was a big disappointment in Miami.
Terrible food, Terrible service.
It isn’t worth the visit.
If you want to enjoy a Peking duck, there are better options than Hakkasan."
"The restaurant is placed on the second floor of The Fontainebleau Miami Beach Hotel, is an exclusive place, with an cozy atmosphere and very expensive chinese food, the plates are very well presented and the menu in not a easy thing if you are not familiar with that kind of delicatessens, not for people that don't eat what they can't pronounce (like me), but is a beautiful place and a unforgettable experience, ideal to go with someone to impress well."
"When visiting Hakkasan you may want to go straight to your table , the bar decor/service is so lovely that the restaurant is likely to suffer in comparison. It certainly suffers in comparison to Hakkasan London. The front of house staff are not very friendly and verge on the bossy. The food seemed heavy and overly seasoned ( not the spices but the salt levels ) , the service is feels rushed  although our waitress had a positive attitude I felt the the restaurant rushes you , the speed which the servers bring the food out and plonk it on the table is not conducive to a relaxing dinner."
"Love Hakkasan !  Sexy decor, romantic ambiance this is a beautiful property.  Our server  was attentive and service was outstanding. We had a party of 8 and all were happy. Our dishes were light and flavorful , everything  was delicious.  Highly recommend !"
Really great food. Way to many children at this restaurant for my taste..even in the evening. So not a good 'adult' choice. This is strictly for tourists.
We visit it based on our previous experience with London hakkasan. Atmosphere was good but we did not like the dividing of the Resturent into small section.food was good but over priced.service was good.we were expecting more lively atmosphere with nice music.
"6 of us went to Hakkasan today. It was a very good experience. The negative was the view wasn't much. I expected more but the atmosphere was delightful. The service was excellent and the food very good.
Several had the Dim Sum price fixe menu. They had more than enough food and were very happy with all of it. I had the Soft Shell crab, Bok Choi, Squid Ink and Chive Prawn Cheung Fun, Wild Mushroom Hand Pulled Noodle and Mushroom Cheung Fun. The Bok Choi was good but my least favorite. The prawn and Mushroom Cheung' were excellent. The soft shell crab was very good but a wee bit greasy - still I loved it.
 For dessert the Warm Chocolate Fondant was amazing.
It was not an inexpensive meal but also not overpriced. 
I will go back."
"Food and service good. The dim sum not a little disappointing. Good but not great. We also had dinner there and that was better. Cocktails were delicious. Crispy duck salad was yummy, so was the honey sea bass.... would return for dinner only"
"My partner and I decided to eat at Hakkasan on our last night in Miami Beach.  We arrived at the restaurant without a prior reservation at 8.15pm on a Wednesday night.  The girl on the front desk said that a table would be available in a few minutes and that we could wait in the bar.  Over the course of the next hour and 15 minutes we saw many people come in and be seated before us.  We spoke to a guy working in the restaurant 3 times.  Each time we were told that they were working on getting a table ready and he would come back and seat us shortly.  At 9.30pm, after our 1 hour 15 mins wait we decided to ask the front desk what had happened to getting us a table.  She proceeded to say sorry but you're second on the waiting list and you'll only get a table tonight if we have a cancellation.  My partner and I were furious at having to wait for over an hour for a table that didn't exist.  We are disappointed in being misled and if we had been given accurate information at the time we arrived at the restaurant we would have probably gone elsewhere to eat.  The staff attitude was appalling.  I'm sure the food is good but I will never return to this particular Hakkasan due to the way we were dealt with by the restaurant's staff."
"As this restaurant is located inside the ""Las-Vegas-like"" Fontainebleau, getting to the restaurant itself after arriving at the hotel´s front door takes some walk throught this huge and crowded place, which I didn´t like much. Said so, the restaurant is very trendy and has a very nice ambiance, divided in many smaller rooms. Food was delicious! The crispy duck salad was worth the whole meal!"
"Food tasted fine & service was good. I would rather try other places though, instead of returning here."
"My wife and I were staying at the Fontainbleau and wanted a late night dinner as we were still on West Coast time for our first night in Miami.  We had a 10 o'clock reservation on a Sunday night.  The place was jammed and after eating there we can see why.  The food was delicious.  My wife had Chilean Sea Bass, one of the best I have ever had. I had the wok fried, black pepper lamb chops, while they were good I wish I would have gone with the sea bass which is quite a compliment as I am a big meat eater. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. 

We started with mushroom asparagus lettuce wraps that were a mouth watering treat.  If you are in Miami Beach, it is worth the visit."
"My husband and I went to the FontaineBleau for our anniversary. They had a few restaurants to choose from at the resort. We chose Hakkasan based on ambiance. We had the Jasmine tea smoked ribs that came to our table already hanging off the bone. Then for dinner we had the egg fried rice, broccoli rabe in bean curd and the Charcoal grilled Chilean Sea Bass. WOW! I still talk about this dinner. There was a large party seated next to us but we were in our own world enjoying each drink and plate of food that was brought to us. I cant wait to go again some day."
"We waited for ever even though we had reservations.  Waited at the bar, they made good drinks but 20 bucks each.  The menu is interesting, tasty but they tell you the portions are huge which is not really true.Compare to other restaurants at FB this is a better value however."
"This is a must visit while in Miami beach - The food is fresh , exciting & beautifully presented. The waiting staff are knowledgable & friendly & the ambiance is sultry & oriental. They have an extensive sake menu & the dim sum starter was a major hit with us all ."
"Excellent service, and the food is delicious.

Though overly busy at times, staff were always courteous and accommodating. My favourite destination in Miami by far."
"Ate at Hakkasan in April 2013. The food was fantastic. Had the dim sum platter (rather small plate for what I had expected), duck salad, beef tenderloin, seabass, curry shrimp, fried rice and chinese noodles. The out of this world dishes were the seabass, fried rice and chinese noodles. The beef is also very tender. The service is excellent and the waitresses are extremely knowledgeable. The prices are ridiculously expensive but worth the experience once in a while."
"The wife and I decided to splurge for our anniversary and visited Hakkasan. It was our first time to the restaurant and came highly recommended by a colleague. It is located inside the Fountainebleau hotel on SoBe and after reading several reviews I must admit our expectations were quite high. So we made reservations and when we arrived we were seated immediately. The atmosphere and decor was an impressive mix as Modern SoBe meets traditional Asian. However, with other couples sitting literally an arms-length on each side... privacy is out of the question. We had several different and unique servers with each being nice and attentive. We ordered drinks, appetizers (Crab and sweetcorn soup/Duck roll) and main courses (Sanpei chicken claypot/ Wok fried yellow tail red snapper in king soya) and everything was JUST OK... nothing  stood out, nothing spectacular, no flavorful explosions.... Just ok. So for us, the food did not live up to expectations but the overall experience was good. But when you pay $250+ for a meal you expect the food to be spectacular, or least one dish. Oh well."
"I was brought here by my bestie for my birthday. We waited for a long while to be seated, even with a reservation. Itt was a full house, I guess. 

The food was delish. Shaken Beef and string beans for her and Honey Glazed Sea Bass for me.  Amazing. I will go back again."
"Very  good  service   even at  crowded  bar , portions  are generous  and  flavors  tingle, drings  are wine  sre  served  witha  generous  hand-had  mushroom wraps and  a  chunk of  sea bass,  slightly sweet  ,  smoky  and  spicy with  layers of flavors"
"It's a really expensive restaurant, but if you can pay for a good and different meal, it's worth. The ambient is great and the service is very good, they are all very attentive! I had a great experience there, the ocean view is wonderful."
"Priced very high for the offering.  Lobster was only mediocre, but sixty dollars in price.  Shrimp rice was excellent. Salad was tasty but sweet; frills of tara root add carbs when one expects greens. Overall disappointed."
"Was working a conference recently at The Fontainebleau Hotel and stopped by Hakkasan for lunch with coworker for the Dim Sum. Delicious meal at a reasonable value for Miami Beach.  However, beware of the iced tea refills - they come and ask you often if you want a refill. Each glass is $7 - and refills are not free. So, you could ring up a hefty bill with just your beverage if you do not pay attention."
"The night started out on a bad note, we arrived at 725 for our 730 reservation and we had to wait till 8 to be seated. This annoys me. From there things only got better. 

For an appetizer we split the dim sum sampler and the mushroom soup. Both were excellent, the sampler was soooooo good. Especially the squid ink dumpling. 

For an entree we split the wok lamb which was excellent, very tender and great flavor. We also split the  fried rice (xo or something like that), best fried rice I have ever had in my life. I didn't want it to end. You know the feeling you have when you finish eating Chinese food, instant regret and a mouth full of salt, you will not get that here. The food almost tastes healthy. We also dined at Scarpetta on this trip and we preferred hakkasan over it.  Definitely a great place to dine while at the hotel."
New and delicious ways of preparation and presentation of Asian foods that were delightful and beautiful.mFoods tasted terrific and each bite was s surprise. Expensivenbut so good we didn't mind!
"Portions are small, food very average at best. The hand-pulled noodles with wild mushrooms costs $17.00 and contains very few mushrooms. A total ripoff.  Prices are ridiculously high for very average food. You are paying for the decor, ambiance, and being part of the  "" scene""."
I really enjoyed my experience at Hakkasan- it is definitely not like any other Asian restaurant I have been to! Try the Black Pepper Steak and the Sweet & Sour Chicken entrees- they were delicious!
"Had a truly wonderful experience again at Hakkasan. Previously ate at the London, Mayfair location and this was just as good. The restaurant is dark, moody and sexy their DJ plays an eclectic mix of music suitable for dinner. We arrived early so that we could sit at the bar and relax, the bar itself is just gorgeous! We were seated at our reservation time and were surprised with a bottle of wine from relatives, as it was our birthdays, Hakkasan surprised us with a dessert, no lame singing servers at this classy place! Everyone that came to the table was professional and polite. The food was excellent and from start to finish the whole experience was impecable. Hope to visit the San Francisco location this summer."
"My wife and I were curious about the Hakkasan restaurant the Fontainebleau. Hakkasan is pricey and the ambiance and decor is very zen like.  

We tried the lunch dim sum special menu and we were pleased with the food. The presentation is outstanding and service excellent. We have experienced a lot of fine Chinese dim sum from San Francisco to Hawaii to Hong Kong. I'd rate this a 4 out of 5 on taste and a 5 for presentation."
"I went to this restaurant on a Sunday night with two girlfriends visiting from New York. One of the girls was Vegan. We had absolutely no problems with the menu. The options are endless and every dish was outstanding. The service was also impeccable. 

We had a drink at the bar before dinner (highly recommended). A great bar with a great cocktail list."
"scene-y and tough-to- get -in chic, but food was just slightly above par from your average chinese restaurant. on the other hand, i live in NYC where we have a chinatown, so authentic is easy to come by. For Miami Beach, this might be the highest quality Chinese food you can find, though you certainly pay the price. Service was pushy and had no restraint, difficult to enjoy your dinner when the server is interrupting you the entire time."
"Ok,  so it came very highly recommended by a friend. The good....beautiful ambiance. Impressive physical surrounding as you should expect at a top Miami beach hotel, Waiters were very attentive and knew the menu very well. The food itself was mixed. Food visual presentation was excellent. A couple of the preparations were excellent, particularly the grilled sea bass and duck with mango appetizer. A couple others were average, what I would get at an average Chinese restaurant in Boston. The prices were excessive and the portions small so you could leave hungry. So....it depends what kind of dining experience you're looking for. It should impress a date or a client but if the food quality or value is an issue I'd pass."
I tried the Dragon Roll as reccomended by Arenthia Nolen in the Valet. It was by far the best sushi I have had in awhile!
"Hakkasan Miami Beach is fantastic all the way from interior design to food to service. And yes, also pricey. But I guess you get what you pay for! The appetizers we had were amazing (ribs, shrimp and a beef stir), the main courses (grouper and duck) were good and the dessert (chocolate fondant) was amazing! If, or rather, when I go back to Miami Beach I will return for a bunch of appetizers and that fondant (if it is still on the menu)!"
Food was delicious and service was perfect!  One of our party is a vegetarian and our server made excellent recommendations!
"Pros: 
Great menu and wide variety of choices 
Decent service 
Delicious Asian cuisine + flavors 

Cons: 
Large, hard to navigate restaurant 
Portions quite small
Price very high considering portion size 
Very dark 
Service could be better 

Overall: could take it or leave it. Great meal but for the price there are many better, fine dining options in Miami + SOBE"
"Went to Hakkasan for second time.  At my first visit we only ate Dim Sum at the bar.  On our most recent visit, we had a full selection of appetizers and entrees.  Everything was outstanding.  Dim sum platter is not to be missed, as noted by other reviewers.  Other standouts were crispy almond prawn and the Crispy Szechuan beef tenderloin.  The ambience is great.  Prices are high but not outrageous for a resort.  This is the best restaurant at the Fountainebleau Resort.  Don't miss it if you are visiting."
"We met some friends their that came in from out of town that just love that restaurant and we left the ordering to them.  Since we were the first ones there, we waited for them at the beautiful bar.  From then on it just went up hill with service and food and everything else. It is amazing that I never knew Asian food could ever be this HIGH END dining.  From the Appetizers to the Entrees the food just kept on coming and coming and one thing was more delicious then the other.  At the end there was noting left on the table. I only remember the Honey Sea Bass and will never forget it.  It was the best thing I have ever tasted.  It is expensive, but it is an OMG.  Call for reservations.  you will not be sorry.  786 276 1388"
"My husband and I took a weekend trip to Miami and stayed at the Fountainbleu. We love Asian food and decided to have a late night meal here. Everything, from the food & drinks, to decor and ambience, was superb. The waitress was friendly and attentive, as were all the servers. The food was delicious, and our specialty drinks were delightful. A bit pricey - maybe...but coming from NY, a hot spot like this would be comparably priced. It definitely was a scene, and we enjoyed every adult minute of it! (Aside from a very busy bartender who could have been friendlier, it was a perfect evening out.) Would definitely visit again!"
"It is pricey. That's for sure.
It is gorgeous. The place is precisely the same as the two restaurants in London.
It is delicious. The food is divine. Dim Sum was perfect and the set menus are reasonable at $27 per person.
It is well served. The crew make it easy and fun. 
It is definitively worth it."
"The food is excellent, so is he ambiance. We had an extremely friendly and knowledgeable waitress. Really a special occasion. Will be back!"
I have been to this restaurant several times since it opened and it has never disappointed. The decor is very sexy and the food and service are excellent. Be sure to arrive early and have a few drinks at the bar- they have delicious specialty cocktails. Can't forget mention the service- attentive without being intrusive. Enjoy!
"Very cool sexy atmosphere, excellent food, very good service.  Love the Hakkasan's in London and this one is just as good.  I go every time I'm in Miami."
"Fabulous food. We were a large party (19 people, 3 generations) so we really got to try just about everything on the menu -- and the preparation for everything was terrific.  I especially loved the Hot and Sour soup and the Szechuan beef -- but really, everything was great.  And they have a good wine list as well.  The restaurant is tucked away in the biggest hotel on earth... so there is a long walk from the entry of the hotel.  But even though you go through the pool area (chlorine smelling elevators) when you do get there, the setting of the restaurant is very pretty and actually quite glamorous."
The setting of this restaurant is very good. The bar is amazing. Service was impeccable the staff so friendly. The food was really good try to go with a minimum of 4 so you can share more dishes. It's not a cheap restaurant so be prepared but in my view you get what you pay for here. Crispy beef pancakes a twist on the duck ones were delicious. Located down the corridors of the Fontenbleau Hotel and on the 4 th floor.
"Amazing service. Amazing food and drinks menu. Again, pricey but certainly worth it. Like all things in this hotel"
From the stylish bar to the friendly staff and great food - we had a fantastic evening with good food and wine (and we didn't need to go mega expensive and it was still good and the wine waiter was friendly) Our waitress was happy and helpful and explained the menu as well and advised us how many mains and sides.  Such a rare occasion in a restaurant like this when the staff don't jut let you order too much food. The food was also very reasonable: we paid in dollars what we would have paid in £ in London.
Great Food! We gave the waiter free hands - bring us a good composition – and no disappointment at all got very food to a reasonable price and topped off with a tequila tasting – we were more than happy will definitely go back again – next time when in Miami
"Was lucky enough to get a groupon for $200 worth for only $100. My girlfriend and I went about a year ago and it was amazing. Our bill was still over $350 but I have to say I'll never forget the food and night. Pricy but well worth it. Try the coconut prawn, Delicious!"
"Whilst it's always fun to dress up and go to a fancy restaurant, this one was not worth the hype. The drinks and food are ridiculously expensive and the menu items don't really differ from your local chinese restaurant. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. There's far more fun places in South Beach with better food."
"Funnily enough I would not recommend this place for its food, which was ok but not great; what is amazing is the vibe! Do not miss it while in Miami Beach. It's a perfect location for a Saturday night! 

I was not impressed with their drinks, unlike many other people. I had a Bellini wich was made with cheap Martini prosecco (for 16$); only just ok. Their pink moijto was ok but I had much better ones. 

My favourite dish was the dumpling mix; really fresh, simply amazing.

Their duck was good too. 

I can't say the same about their lobster and veg dish; the sugarpeas were cold when the dish was served. After we complained, we received the very same plate which was probably put in the microwave rather than being freshly made again; not exactly what you would expect in a restaurant of this sort, but nevermind. 

Our waiter, a charming Brazilian man, was fabulous; attentive, friendly, witty. 

We unfortunately witnessed a fist fight between two guests during dinner, which was very shocking; however, not the restaurant's fault, of course. 

The atmosphere and interiors are amazing; one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to. Definitely worth a visit."
"Delicious food, great choice on the menu but the waitress did not seem to like her job very much...
The dum sum is excellent"
"Love, love, love...I love Hakassan.  First of all, the ambiance is amazing, like a secret asian maze, with dark wood and cool blue walls, very cool.  Then, the food is amazing, and you can share.  We had some great dished and were so stuffed we could not finish!

1.  Dim Sum basket - ok, not the best thing we had
2.  Chicken Dumplings - delicious and crispy
3.  Tofu with Mushrooms and veggies - yummy and light and fresh
4.  Claypot chicken - soo tender and yummy sauce
5.  Green beans - sticky, sweet, and amazing
6.  Seabass (the best one per the waitress) - sweet, fresh, and smooth. 

Drinks are strong, but inventive.  I had been years ago, and excited to go back again!"
"I had a business dinner at Hakkasan in the Fontainebleau. Started out at the bar with Mojito's which were above average. We were escorted to our table by a lovely hostess. The menu was a little overwhelming so we decided to have the waiter do the ordering. All of us (4) were blown away with his selections. We started out with appetizers that included a crispy duck salad that was the best duck I have ever had. Followed by lettuce wrap, and a dim sum platter which were exceptional. The main course, serverd family style (as were the apps) included Prawn with crispy wheat flake, Black pepper beef tenderloin, Wok fried yellow tail red snapper in king soya, Crispy mala roasted chicken, and Baby pak choi. This was the best meal I had during my stay in Miami beach. Truly a must do stop if your in the mood for over the top Chinese fare...."
We ordered based on our waitresses recommendations and the food was beautifully presented and delicious.  Service was impeccable.
"There is Chinese food (one of the world's greatest cuisines I am told) and there is American Chinese food (for which no high claims are made though most of us love it). Hakkasan was an extraordinary surprise. We weren't expecting it. It was one of the best, most memorable dining experiences of our lives. Yes, the place is beautiful ... yes the entry through the lobby of Miami Beach's iconic Fontainbleu Hotel is like being on a cruise ship for a few hours (only at night) ... the Chilean sea bass, an extraordinary fish to begin with is raised higher in there non-traditional coating & preparation ... the meat, the fish ... everything was extra-ordinary. We went back twice. It costs the earth and when you can afford it, it is worth every penny."
"Beautiful decor and ambiance . Very relaxing  with consistently delicious food and  excellent service.
Mahmood Abousalem , the manager is always exceedingly professional and committed
to ensuring that everything is perfect . His warmth and genuine care and concern are above
and beyond expectations. He deserves a huge promotion!!!"
"Hakkasan is a place that I think everyone should dine at least once. This was simply the best Chinese food I have ever had, and even probably one of the best meals I've ever had. 

The portions are small, so you can order one thing and for many people have an adequate amount of food. But that's not really the fun in going to Hakkasan. The fun is going with a small group and ordering a bunch of things to share. 

The hand pulled noodles are great. The sea bass is delicious and just melts in your mouth. The dim sum is not only delicious but beautifully presented. We also had a spicy prawn dish that was out of this world. 

As others have mentioned, this restaurant is not cheap. Cocktails start at $17 each and ordering several of even the least expensive food items will quickly add up. However, if you're staying at the hotel, you may get a coupon book and should look for some coupons for Hakkasan. One I had was for 20% off signature dining, Sun-Thurs from 6pm-7pm. That's a great discount!"
"Significant other and I dined here - the food was excellent as was the wait staff.  We had a crispy almont shrimp appetizer (excellent), Stir-fried lobster (good but light on flavor), charcoal grilled seabass and egg fried rice.  Not to die for but very very good.  Was a little pricey at $266.  Our waitress - Veronique was excellent - always there but unobtrusive."
"What a silly place, for silly people, brought to you by uninterested waiters. Not anyplace I recommend but I suspect the clientele go here for the name and perceived ambience, and not for the food. Very low price value factor."
"For an asian restaurant, this one will always be in my favorites.  It has one of the coolest atmospheres for a restaurant.  House music, beautiful decor, and a great menu. It was a little expensive but worth every penny.  I would definitely come back."
The XO rice and duck rolls should not be missed!  The bar has some fabulous drinks to chose from...but come with your pocketbook fully stocked!
Had a great time at a birthday gathering.  Found was superb and service was great! Had a fabulous time.  Have a great assortment of drinks.
"Gorgeous and expensive and busy and the food is great and the staff is terrific and we love it. Though we live an hour and a half away, we drive there for dinner a few times/winter."
"Brunch Miami Spice Menu had endless selection and was delicious!  Service is great, drink selection is great!  And you can't beat the location in the gorgeous Fountainbleau Hotel!"
"Nice atmosphere, romantic place to eat, and tasty food too!  Authentic Chinese ingredients from wolf berries to fungus.  The prefixe menu was a wonderful tour through some Chinese favorites, roast pork, fried rice, wonton soup, beef medallions in Sichuan sauce and stir fried veggies.  Definitely recommend if you want not so standard Chinese food and a great classy atmosphere."
"We opted for the superficially reasonably priced Miami Spice menu at $39/head. With two cocktails, their cheapest bottle of sake and one cup of coffee we ended up with a wallet-wilting check totalling $223 for two people! The food, with the minor exception of the delicious soup being slightly cold, was undeniably world class."
"Everything was peefect. The place, the food, the service. It is a litlle more expensive, but worth it. Try the chocolate fondant as a desert. Best ever."
"Dinner was amazing,service attentive but not hovering, our server Daniel B.,was there but not there. Crispy Duck salad was exciting with flavor and presentation.

Whatever you order expect to enjoy with happiness!

Love this restaurant. The music is at a level that you are able to to have a conversation without screaming. 
The plus is that you can understand the music, the DJ has chosen the right sounds for a great evening at this fabulous restaurant!!!!"
Went to enjoy the Miami Spice menu and had an excellent experience. Our waiter Ati was awesome. Everyone was extremely pleasant. A must go to restaurant!!!
"Hakkasan was wonderful, from the food which was 5 stars to the drink which were delicious. Our server Nick was awesome, never left our glasses empty and was very attentive to our needs. Would go back anytime!"
I went to Hakkasan with a group of colleagues.  We all ordered the Miami Spice menu and it wa excellent.  The courses were served family style and the service was great.  The food was delicious!
"Great shared plates - esp sea bass! great atmosphere, wonderful service!  Overall one of the best meals of the trip!"
"We love Asian cuisine and we are from a large metropolitan area. This is the best we've ever had. I had the chicken Szechuan and my husband had the spicy pork, we added a side of jasmine rice with egg and spring onion. Every bite was delicious and our waiter was top notch. He learned we were celebrating our anniversary and brought us a special dessert. If you have a chance to go by all means you won't be disappointed. ENJOY!"
"Really gorgeous restaurant with striking interiors. Even the ladies bathroom was gorgeous.  Hotel renovation was major and beautiful. Food quality and presentation were excelllent. Service was terrible which was such a disappointment! 

Our food was served family style and the spacing was way off. Everything came very quickly until the main course which was served about 20 minutes after the vegetable side dish and noodles. When the seabass arrived the waitress apologized for the small portion  they served us and offered extra noodles or vegetables to make up for it.   We declined.  Iced tea is $7 per glass with no refills and I had to ask 3 times and wait over 15 minutes for a second glass of tea.  

The place was gorgeous but our group of 5 people all left feeling disappointed in the experience. It was not crowded adn we were there for a 1pm lunch on a Saturday. One of the diners in our party had been there on a separate occasion and had a great experience so maybe the place is starting to go downhill???"
"A group of 8 of us had dinner at Hakkasan on Sunday night. We were able to sit in a private dining room. The menu is family style, which worked well because we were all able to order several things and share (this was perfect because too many options on the menu to pick just one!) You must dine here when staying at the Fontainbleau!"
We came to Hakkasan during Miami spice month so we had the $39 set menu. Everything was lovely and there was so much food for two people which is unusual for a set menu. The setting is lovely. Very dark with lots of wood makes it atmospheric. For a top hotel restaurant it's not stuffy or pretentious and the staff make you feel very welcome. Gorgeous non alcoholic cocktails too.
"Delicious Chinese Food with Prices to Match
Service Very Good and Ambience Very Pleasant
Great Cocktails"
"We went to Hakkasan at the advise of a friend and because of all the great reviews.  I have to say that we were very disappointed.  The food was ok, nothing special.  We've had better chinese food out in the suburbs of Philadelphia where we live, not to mention China Town in Philly and NYC.
The Hot and Sour soup was thick and too salty to my taste.  The pumpkin in black bean was undercooked and not tasty. The orange chicken was ok, the eggplant ok and the spicy beef was good (but not worth 38 dollars for a single entree!).  If the prices were lower, I would give this place 3 stars, but since they are priced sky-high, I took off another point.  For those prices I expected the food to be sublime. 
Don't bother, save your money."
"excellent service, very friendly and knowledgeable waitress menu. Food was great. All I recharged much to tip."
Staying at the Fontainebleau hotel we tried Hakkasan and chose the set menu. All food was great and we tried dishes we'd never normally order. God quality food that was tasty and plentiful. Service was a bit disappointing sadly.
"We visited Hakkasan restaurant in Miami after recommendation from our hotel concierge. We arrived and were given a table that reminded more of a Bistro seating, and very disappointing as we were dressed up and out for fine dining. But never the less, it was a special occasion and we were not going to spoil an evening over seating.  The waiter came and introduced a Miami spice menu, she added that it could be highly recommended, we then added a vine flight to our order, again recommended by our waiter. To start with the food, it seemed to me they had added their cheapest and most tasteless food available to this menu. I am not very fussy but have dined at good, moderate and not so high class restaurants all over the world but this was not good at all. Then the most disappointing thing was the vine flight, this was a total disaster and an embarrassment to the restaurant. We were served three glasses, one aperitif, one white and one red, but the volume of each glass is less than what you are pored if you want to just taste a vine. I have of cause ordered vine flight in different restaurants and NEVER had this experience. I would remove the vine flight from the menu and do the same with the Miami spice 3 coarse menus as it will give clients a poor dining experience and the place horrible reputation. I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone. Even dining at any random restaurants will guarantee you a better experience."
"We did the Miami Spice special at Hakkasan in Fotainebleau and it was one of the best special I've had. More than enough food and its worth the money. Jaira was our server and she did a wonderful job. Her service was above and beyond. For the most part the food was good (excluding the tufu, way too soft)."
Great Chinese cuisine on the premises of the Fontainebleau.  Never a bad dinner here.  Would recommend to anyone that is willing to spend a little more $ than usual.
"Went for our anniversary last year. Loved the vibe, food, service, drinks...It was our first dining experience in the Fountainebleau and it certainly lived up to the hype!"
"You must, must, must, must, must go for Sunday Dim Sum.  The food and atmosphere was absolutely fantastic.  I enjoyed sunday chinese brunch prior to this trip but now can only think about what I had here and nothing compares.  I am looking forward to my next trip to Miami to come back to Hakkasan.  The service was also 5-stars.  

Be sure to make reservations as this is a popular spot to dine on Miami Beach."
"We over-ordered, contrary to the mild caution from the waitress, so we could widely sample the variety.  Every dish was exceptional.  Having worked n China, I mention to others how unauthentic most Chnese restaurants are outside of China.  We had 4 main dishes: Crispy chicken with orange sauce, Spicy prawn with lily bulb and almonds, Wok fried yellow tail red snapper in king soya, and the Stir-fried scallop with lily bulb and yellow chive.  The snapper was outstanding.  The fish dishes were very good. We did not particularly like the thick KFC style coating on the chicken, and the orange was VERY sweet.  In addition, we had the Singapore vermicelli and the Szechuan style braised aubergine.  The aubergine/eggplant was delicious.  Great time."
"I took my friend to this restaurant for his birthday on July 1st 2012 and the service was phenomenal, food 10 out of 10, the staff absolutely fantastic, there is not one bad thing to say about this restaurant I will DEFINITELY be returning here on more than one occasion.  Greatest experience in restaurant 100 out of 100...PERFECT"
"We are transported every time we walk into the very hip interior of this fabulous restaurant.  The glowing blue bar, the latticework nooks, the intimate corners booths all contribute to a very special meal.  Every bite, every dipping sauce a masterpiece.  Our server today was pitch perfect throughout our meal.  We were there last Thanksgiving for dinner (the peking duck vastly superior to any holiday turkey) and plan to make it our new annual tradition."
"Beautiful place with a great staff.
Food was very good , a little expensive but good.
we over ordered but that was our fault. The portions were very big.
Best things were the shrimp appetizer and the tofu claypot."
"I have been to Hakkasan on 3 occasions and love it!  The space is gorgeous, very dark and sexy.  The music is very cool but not loud like most of the South Beach restaurants, I believe the have a DJ on the weekends.  It is not your average Chinese restaurant.  It is expensive but the overall ambience, food and service is over the top.  The manager Max, has been most accommodating and gracious on our last two visits.  It is great for dates or anytime you want to impress someone."
"The first impression that jumps out when you step into Hakkasan is the amazing decor. A series of elegant labyrinths leading to romantic niches surrounded by ornately carved screens that envelope the space, create a very private and seductive ambiance. We started off with the obvious choice: the Dim Sum Platter. It consisted of eight portions of dim sum, two Scallop shu mai topped with roe, two shrimp har gau, two shrimp with Chinese chives, and two vegetarian, all served in a bamboo steamer. They were delicious!  Next we tried the signature Charcoal Grilled Silver Cod with Champagne and Chinese Honey. We weren't prepared for the incredible decadence of this dish! The symphony of flavors was spectacular, enticing the palate with the sweetness of the honey and the silky juiciness of the fish. I highly recommend this entree if you want to try a dish that will leave you breathless!

"Located in the legendary Fontainebleau, Hakkasan has lovely design and delicious cocktails but the food was mediocre and little too greasy in my opinion. My friends seemed to enjoy it so I don't feel right giving it a bad review--it might just simply not be my ""cup of tea""."
"very nice food and decoration. The service was very good, the suggestions were perfect."
"Great service, tasty food but a little pricey for the portion sizes on offer"
"Hakkasan is beautiful from the moment you walk in. 4th floor elevator entry is very impressive. Contemporary asian design, delicious dim-sum menu. Get the french beans!"
Went there last minute with no reservation and had to wait at the bar. I'm not sure if this is done on purpose so you start spending money there already. We did not mind as the bar is great and good seletion of cocktails with nice ambiance. Once seated we decided to share several dishes of the which the best by far was the Peking duck. This is one of my favorite dishes and it was one of the best ever. Tasty meaty duck with just the right crisp. I had to write this review if only to mention the Peking duck! Price was surprisingly reasonable for what you get and place itself. Of course it all depends on what you order. Will definitely return.
"Especially if you dont want to leave the hotel, this is one of the best in town"
"We ended up here without a reservation and were ushered in.  The server was knowledgeable and suggested amazing dishes for us.  Definitely, try the Dim sum platter as well as the crispy duck salad.
We stayed for after dinner cocktails and were treated to some great new drinks.
The decor is wonderful!"
"The food at this place is just amazing. The ribs were fantastic and came off the bone like melted butter - perfect and tasty. The service was very great too. A ""high maintenance"" lady at the table next too us started to complain and the waiter kept his calm. And the place is also very romantic."
"Very nice place to eat. order different things to share,so you can try all. Mske reservation in advance"
"This is a restaurant worth going to if you are in the South Beach area.  It's a great scene and the food is very good.  Service, as with most SB establishments, is ok.  We had an 8:30 reservation, early by SB standards, and felt very rushed to eat and move on. Im not sure if they had another party going to use the table but for the cost, we felt it was ours for the night! :)  Cocktail menu was extensive and drinks were great but perhaps a bit weak.....especially the martinis."
"This restaraunt was so different and beautiful!  The place is huge, but feels very small the way the rooms are arranged.  Our servers were great.  The food was excellent, and beautiful to look at!"
"I know how crazy people love here, because I went to this place based on the great comments from tripadvisor and yelp and I am very disappointed by it. The problem of their food is, everything is not terrible but not good neither. Basically everything is cooked with heavy oil and a lot of salt and soy sauce, and they call it in a name of a classic Chinese dish. The clay pot chicken was a zero, I couldn't tasted Chinese wine and basil from it and it was not fried at first(the right way to cook the dish), it was like a ""Soy sauce chicken pot"". The szechuan eggplant didn't tasted like szechuan AT ALL, it's more like ""eggplant with heavy oil and chili"". However I have to give credit to the cocktail Hakka, I love it. and the waiter was very nice at first, but he became aggressive and unfriendly immediately after I raised my questions about the food. He might think that I want a discount on the bill or something, but anyway he barely said ""your food is almost done and I can't do anything with it"". He also ask what do I want in a very rude way, and I told him I just want the chef to know then he felt released. Anyway I am very upset bout this restaurant and I hope my experience would help you to save your money here."
"Decided to have a late dinner at Hakkasan (10:45 pm sitting).  All I can say is, ""WOW!""  How to describe it?  Not a quiet place late night.  More like fine dining at a Rave.

Fortunately, I am a big fan of electronic dance music, becuase it was non-stop thump -thump-thump from the moment we walked in and sat at the bar, waiting for our table to be ready, until an hour and a half later, when we left.  The decor is cool.  Bar was intriguing - had some cocktail made with bamboo.  Food was delicious. The place was packed the whole time we were there, full of millenials dressed to the nines, who also seem to enjoy loud music with their meal.

Highly recommend . . .unless you have a headache."
Fantastic! Have the cod in champagne and honey it's to die for and the service was incredible
"Down in Miami  visiting my sister and brother-in-law and he took us to the Hakkasan at the Fontainebleau Hotel. It was the place to stay during the ""Rat Pack"" days and has gotten even better over time with lots of new restaurants. If you go to Hakkasan bring your appetite and lots of money. The Duck salad is incredible as is the beef and fish dishes. We all ordered something different and shared. The bill for the four of us plus drinks and tip came to about $600. It's certainly not something I would do every night (unless someone else was paying). As for the scenery, all I can say the the plastic surgeons down in Miami know what they are doing. By the way, reservations on the weekends are a must."
"My friends and I are from London and a couple of us had been to Hakkasan here. So when we were in Miami they wanted to eat here especially as it was in our hotel. I was apprehensive as I am a vegetarian and not so fond of the cuisine. However, I was utterly delighted. From the minute we walked in, the staff were really nice and friendly, the cocktails at the bar whilst we waited were beautiful! The setting of the restaurant was perfect and the food was 100% standard."
"in the new hakkasan there which was over the top,so I had great expectations for the Dinner which than was really average .The drinks were ok,but the food was not in anyway outstanding,but really expensive,service was very good,but friends told me afterwards,that the quality had faded."
"We are Hakkasan regulars around the world and usually love the service, food and atmosphere. In early May the evening at the Miami Beach location was a disaster. It started with a10 minute wait to be seated and through the evening, service was terribly slow and inattentive. Waitress most of the time out of sight, more than once we had to ask for the menu, a drink order, food etc. A second glass of wine never arrived but appeared on the bill. When I asked for deletion, the waitress implied that I was lying and try to get a free glass of wine! The food was ok, dim sum great as always, chicken and rice ok.
Compared to other Hakkasans, especially the great one in Abu Dhabi, this is a disgrace to the brand. Never again!"
"A friend & I ate at Hakkasan in October, 2011 - then there was a Dim Sum lunch and there were 4 choices that were designed for two people. We got dumplings, rice, noodles, and a variety of other small dishes. The food was great and the drinks were great as well, but the specialty drinks were a little too sweet for my taste. The atmosphere is what I really loved about this place - the sleek A line design with a chic modern twist, all tied to together with a positive Asian energy feel. 
I only gave this location a 4 - since the service was lacking...when I asked our server to describe some of the dishes, she acted like it was bothersome. The pleasant couple beside us, tried to use their gift card & it kept getting declined and they didn't really resolve the issue. They just said they didn't know why the card didn't work and didn't really try to help much. 

I'm off for NYC next week & plan to visit the Hakkasan there, I hope the service is much better!"
"It was good, but the portions were small and I was still hungry."
Food is incredible and service is great. Asian fusion place at the Fontainebleu hotel. Quiet intimate setting. Try the spicy chicken appetizer- mouthwatering. And the edon braised eggplant (noodles)
As good as Hakkasan in London. A great experience.
What in the world is the deal with this restaurant?  Food is ridiculously overpriced.  Everything we ordered was floating in a greasy sauce.  Lots and lots of greasy sauce on tasteless food -- for $50 a piece.  The place has no view or ambiance whatsoever.   It is too dark and the decor is just downright depressing.  Cocktails were disgusting.  Service was very business-like (although I have to give it to our waitress -- she did take a couple of items that were simply inedible off of the bill without giving us any attitude whatsoever).  Bottom line on this place -- just don't do it!
"If there is every going to be a Michelin 3 star restaurant, this may be it. The food is amazing and the service is even better!"
"Superb place, excellent service, high price, and bad food.

Hakkasan is gorgeous, but the food is greatly disappointed! 

I heard of that an article about Hakkasan was published in a local Chinese newspaper, and this article recommended Peking duck. According to the United Chinese News of Florida, Peking duck is one of hot sellers in Hakkasan with over 1,000 orders in one month. How could I miss this good opportunity to taste the Chinese famous cuisine. We ordered Peking duck($198), duck salad($25), lamb($48), and Singapore vermicelli($18). The food are egregiously overpriced! However, the food disappointed us. Singapore vermicelli was burnt. Lamb was raw. Duck salad did not come with enough sauce. Peking duck was the worst! It was totally different from the authentic Peking duck in Beijing. They were not worth paying such high prices. I can get the better Peking Duck elsewhere for much less. And our waitress told us they sold seven to eight orders of Peking duck each day. OMG! The article was so exaggerated!! Over 1,000 order a month? A fisherman's tale!"
"We had the shredded beef and the vegetarian dim sum platter for starters, and the duck in plum sauce and one of the tofu dishes for main course. All very good but not very exciting. 

Had heard a lot from friends going to the Hakkasan in London but we were expecting more of a Nobu-style experience with food that looks strange, tastes fan-ta-stic and like nothing you ever eaten before. Hakkasan was more of a upscale chinese restaurant in a trendy setting. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 

Prices were not that expensive if you're used to finer asian establishments in Europe. 

Great service and drinks."
"The restaurant was perfect... Good Food, perfect Staff... Actually... The Somelier Henrique bring us the best choise of wine!!! Very nice guy!!! We will return for sure!"
"Mixed feelings about this spot.  Food is pretty good, but the atmosphere and service don't warrant the price.  Being located at the Fontainebleau is bad enough, but the trek from the security drenched lobby, down a hall, up a cheap elevator, past the gym to get to Hakkasan makes the bar a welcome sight once you reach it.  Crowded with a mix of tourists and convention types, and very Vegas-y.  Had ok dumplings, awesome yang chow fried rice, very good bbq'd fish.  But service spotty.  Charged for a We generally take at least a couple of hours to dine, but were out of here, thankfully, in less than 90 min."
I cannot wait for a Hakkasan to open in NYC because it was an amazing meal.
"Service is very disappointing. Won't go back there or recommend this place to anyone. So sorry, but you need to work in your hospitality skills!"
"One of the best DJs during our trip to Miami.  The food was immaculate,  Great night for all"
"Dining at Hakkasan restaurant is an experience I recommend to everyone.
The ambient is unique, with an elegant decor. 
The best restaurant in my opinion in the city of Miami.
The wine selection is just AMAZING, if is possible ask for Henrique Vioti, we had a Wine Class with him, a great Wine Specialist who can turn a simple bottle of wine in a geography lesson.
The food is just ""WOW!"". I suggest you to start with the duck salad, lots of flavor, the fried duck is just PERFECT. 
the pork and fish is incredible as well.
For dessert be sure to try the banana creme brulee, simply divine.
The atmosphere with a DJ playing live and all the Glamour of Hakkasan will make you feel like dancing... So, why not visit the Liv Night Club inside the hotel? 
One of the top 10  night clubs in the world!!!

I don't think is price, You pay for what you have... This will be the best chinese restaurant that you can find in MIAMI!!!!"
"Based on the mixed reviews here and elsewhere I was a bit skeptical about having dinner here. I'm glad I did! The service was impeccable thanks to Crystal. The food was incredible. The pork special was amazing. Maybe the best Chinese you can find in Miami. Yes, it's expensive, but once in a while I think it's worth it."
Food was mediocre at best. I've had better noodles from cheap Chinese food delivery. Waiter forgot to put in one of our appetizers and so we got it after our meal. Most places would have comped us a dessert or drink for the oversight but he wasn't even apologetic.  I would not come back here.
Had an excellent dinner.  Atmosphere and food was great.  Waitress recommended some excellent entrees and desserts.
"I do so love a good Chinese meal.  I am spoiled by Chinatowns in NYC, San Fran, Boston and Philly being my go to standards.  This was just. . . well. . . good.  The dim sum appetizer was fresh and tasty, nothing out of the ordinary.  My scallops in black bean sauce were well cooked but again, nothing to write home about.  Nothing on the menu struck me as worth the exorbitant price tags that accompanied it.  Far too many other restaurants in Miami that I wanted to try, this one I could've skipped."
"Where will I start to review this amazing restaurant?? The overall experience was exceptional and Hakkasan is now in my top three of my favorite restaurants of all time.  The ambience is lovely, on the darkish side, but not at all in a negative way it absolutely suits the restaurant.  The bar, the restaurant decor, the seating was all perfection. The booths had comfortable leather seats and there were  pillows for your back that I found was a nice touch and much appreciated.  The embroidered leather on the back of the booths was so pretty.  The walls were done in a teak wood with all kinds of intricate work that added more to the atmosphere.  The service was impeccable... first class all the way.

The food was extraordinary, every bite was delicious and prepared and cooked to perfection.The dim sum and modern Cantonese was so very enjoyable, the dessert was also to die for and the cocktails were lovely.  I do have an allergy to MSG and they worked well with me to make it so that I could eat quite a bit from their menu.  

My sister and brother in law who I dined with, had been to Hakkasan in London, England this past summer and they thought the Miami restaurant was every bit as good as the one in the UK.. Which says a lot considering the London location has received a Michelin star.

I am certainly not surprised that Hakkasan in Miami has received a Four Diamond Award and in 2010 was voted as the best newcomer in South Florida by Zagat.  I highly recommend Hakkasan, you will not be disappointed."
Although we waited for our table more then 2 hours (and we had a reservation) it was the best food experience I have ever had! It was totally worth of waiting!
"Last week my girlfriend and I went to celebrate a night out at the Fontainebleau and we chose Hakkasan for dinner. Everything was amazing, from the greeting of the hostess, to the server and Sommelier Henrique which recommended a great wine.
 We will definetly be coming back next month!

..

."
"i'd like to say that i had the best experience at hakkasan all the times i've been there, not to mention the exceptional attention that Henrique Viotti, one of the sommeliers gave me and my guests. i''ll definetly come back lots of times.

Gisele Parrilla"
"You need a secret map to find Hakkasan as it's buried deep inside the happening Fountain Bleu Hotel. But don't get discouraged, it's well worth the journey.  Somehow the restaurant exudes an ambiance that is equally perfect for an intimate romantic dinner or a fun outing with colleagues.  It features discretely placed, intricately carved bamboo screens, eclectic but comfortable seating arrangements and a beautiful view if you venture to the back of the restaurant.  Family style is the way to go at Hakkasan and rely on the waiters if the menu seems overwhelming.  I went there with work colleagues to celebrate so ordered a ton of dishes and enjoyed them all.  However, my favorite appetizers were the dim sum platters and stir fry shredded beef on pancakes.  For our entries, we loved the grilled sea bass, baked lobster and black pepper beef tenderloin with rice and noodles.  Prices are astronomical, so save up and go when you can afford to lay out $150/person including wine."
"Despite getting routed in 4 different directions around the hotel by hotel staff, we eventually found the restaurant..... its very dark inside! We were seated quickly, and provided menus..... our waiter sugested 4 starters, as opposed to starters and mains, for our European stomachs.... we couldn't finish them, but the food was DIVINE! Watch out for the wine menu..... cheapest bottle of wine is about $50! :-)"
"I loved the ambiance, the privacy of the tables, the decor, the music, the dumplings, the food. I disliked nothing, and I cant wait to return"
"Very expensive but worth every dime!  Amazing experience.  The secret is to order slowly so not to be rushed into ordering too much food.  My wife and I had the Duck mango salad (killer), dum sum (again awesome) and ribs (wow!) all apps.  This was plenty of food!  Top off with a round a drinks and one dessert and $200 later you are very happy."
Hakkasan always delivers good food efficiently with great ambience in London. The same goes for their Miami outfit. Same style and same type of food marginally cheaper than London. Well worth a visit!
"I don't care how much you try to decorate it like a cross between a London dance club and a Tokyo businessman's club-- $28 for seven dimsum dumplings or $30 for sweet and sour pork is a rip-off in any culture.   No doubt it's the best Chinese food for miles, but you can get the same thing at any decent restaurant in any Chinatown (minus the mixed drinks) for 1/4 the price."
"From the moment you arrive, the experience begins. We just followed our servers recommendations. It was perfect. Small servings offset by superb quality and flavors."
"This was truly a dining experience.  A symphony of flavor.  Cozy/Chic interior.
My fiance and i dined at Hakkasan last Saturday night and we both agreed it
was one of the best meals we have ever eaten.  Dim Sum appetizer was amazing.
Chilean Sea-Bass as an entree was the most perfectly prepared fish I have ever 
eaten.  We were both left wondering - How did they prepare that??  How can that be 
so good??
This decision should be easy if you are in Miami Beach and enjoy food with an Asian Flair- GO!"
"The restaurant is hidden in the Fontainebleau Hotel - which is a gigantic place. The decor is stunning, with a waterfall at the bar and wooden ""see through"" walls (w oriental design) separating tables. Romantic. The food is good but overpriced - we were hoping to find more Szechuan type dishes. Good wine list. We would go again, but for drinks."
"Excellent food, great service and fantastic ambience. This is   definitely one of the best restaurants in Miami. It has a great bar as well with an exhaustive list of innovative cocktails. If you visit Miami, you simply cannot afford to miss out on this amazing place."
"Chinese food like, Italian and Mexican has been Americanized to the point of being fast food.  It is quite refreshing to go eat true cuisine, the best if the best that actually reflects the best that culture has to offer.  It is pricey, but with a large group one can order many dishes and truly enjoy an amazing experience!"
"Food was very different, service was excellent, & we had a great time."
"This was my second time visiting and I brought friends back to celebrate a birthday. I was so excited because of the really awesome experience we had the first time. Unfortunately, the service was terrible! Our waitress was not attentive, she rushed us through the entire process and she forgot to put in part of our order. We could not get refills on wine or cocktails and she never even asked us if we enjoyed the food or if we needed anything at all. I had to practically beg her to go and talk to the kitchen about my nut allergy and that is a serious issue. We were not going to say anything because the food was so great, but after we waited an additional 45 minutes to get our bill, we asked to speak to the manager. He was apologetic, but basically said that she was one of their best servers and he was sorry. It then took us another 20 minutes to get the bill. Very disappointing for the amount of money we spent on that meal. Over $500 and treated like we were at McDonalds. We will not return."
"had dinner there. the appetizer- peking dumplings were delicious as was one of the main dishes, chicken with szichuan peppers. The duck with mango was extraordinary, the marriage of a crispy duck breast with sweet mango was a culinary delight.
 the place is very expensive for a ""chinese""  restaurant, with all entrees well above $25 but if you endulge in freshly prepared  and delicious cuisine this is definitely a spot to try."
"Went in not knowing what to expect and came out feeling happy although we spent a $$$. 
The appetizers were elegant and in very very small plates. The lettuce leaves for the lettuce wraps could have been a little larger than the miniature ones that were served. We were left with half of the mushroom filling in the bowl. 
The highlight of the meal was Wok fried yellow tail red snapper in king soya. The fish was deboned and served as a whole fish. It was DELICIOUS. The fish was fresh and cooked just right. I had tears in my eyes as it had been so long since I had eaten fish cooked like that. Sautéed diced chicken with dried chili in ‘Szechuan’ style was another highlight as the heat of the dish and the presentation was great. 

For vegetables, we asked for Gai Lan and Choi Sum, both of which were not available. So the waiter suggested Baby pak choi, which was fresh and we were happy with that. 

What didn't really work for us were the claypots -- Szechuan style braised aubergine had no spice at all and was just bland eggplant inspite of us insisting that we wanted it hot and spicy! Braised Chilean seabass with sour plum and sundried tomato was another disappointment...no character of any kind. Both there dishes were huge disappointment to us considering that every other dish was so delicious and well presented. The claypots may have been done by someone else or not given enough attention. 

We will definitely go back!"
"Stayed at fontainebleau last week and ate there twice during a four-day stay! I don't remember our waiters name, but he was super helpful and sweet. He recommended a few dishes for us and all of them were great. I especially loved the red snapper dish and the dried shrimp fried rice. The restaurant is expensive!! But, what else can you expect in Miami? Went back for dim sum lunch on the weekend and had the forbidden city prix fixe meal, which I thoroughly enjoyed as well.

The decor of the place is very hip and modern.. And though the dish seem small at first (especially for the price), it is definitely filling. My dad, bro and I ordered two dim sum platters, fried rice, reed snapper and peppered beef for dinner and we were stuffed.  I would choose this restaurant over Scarpetta!"
"Thank goodness Hakkasan finally opened a US location, because this food is out of control. Hakkasan is definitely an upscale place, and much better if you're with a large group of people so that you get the opportunity to try as many things on the menu as possible. It was the first Chinese restaurant to win a Michelin star. The food truly is exceptional, and if you have the budget I wouldn't miss it."
"The best meal we had whilst in Miami.

Every course was outstanding, with great service.
My only comment about Hakkasan and it also applies to London  - why is the music so loud??"
This is not your run-of-the-mill oriental restaurant! The food is fantastic and service was perfect!
"We went for lunch on New Years day and had the tasting menu.  Every course was presented beautifully and the flavors of each dish were distinct and absolutely delicious.   One of our party mentioned to the waitress that she was a vegetarian ...  and without asking and without a charge, the chef sent over an extra vegetarian selection to make sure that she had enough to eat ...  such a lovely thing to do and very much appreciated.  The restaurant decor is unique and the staff extremely helpful and friendly.  We LOVED Hakkasan and highly recommend it to all ..."
The Hakkasan at the Fontainebleu is a must for any visitor to Miami.
"It's one of those restaurants where they give you little plates and you pay a lot of money for a little bit of food, but it's simply delicious so your not mad about it.  A group of 6 went there and after an $800 bill, was satisfied with how great everything tasted, but was still hungry so we went back to our rooms and had room service.  But i don't regret it.  Money well spent."
"Nice restaurant, good japanese food.
Wine is ""ok"". 
Now there are hundreds of good restaurants if you're willing to spend about $100 per person.

Waiter was so arrogant. It looks like waiters have to be arrogant at the Fontainebleau resort. Some sort of Mantra maybe. 
Being arrogant probably looks good in their opinion.
Dont smile, do not pronounce and feel like you don't want more customers.
Make no mistake, i am not on a budget and ordered sides, bottle of wine, and all that comes along.
Still no smile.
Tip should be 10% max. Oh, oops, yes Miami. The 18% tip is already included. No need to smile you idiot. I'll get your cash anyway.
I won't be back. There is a crisis out there and many guys worldwide deserve to get extra customers."
"Friday night was my second visit to Hakkasan this year, after the first visit, I didn't think I could be more impressed but, I was....!

The food is awesome, the drinks imaginative and tasty, the wait staff unbelievable and the atmosphere outstanding.  I've been to some of the best restaurants in the world (Tetsuya, French Laundry, etc) and this certainly is as good!"
"We spent our honey moon at the Fointainblue Hotel many years ago. It has been modernized, although some of the old hangouts are no longer there. Instead a fabulous Chinese restaurant with superb food and service has been established and is definitely worth a visit. Bring money!"
"I went to Hakkasan to Celebrate my husband's birthday, we were greeted very warmly while we waited for our table, we enjoyed a delicious cocktail at the bar. The ambiance of the place is great. Once seated at the table we had Henrique 
Viotti the sommelier, who recommended a fabulous wine, he is extremely knowledgable, friendly and helpful, he continued checking on us throughout the night to make sure we were enjoying our wine. 
The food was an out of this world experience, we enjoyed and loved every appetizer and entree that we ordered.
Lauren the restaurant manager (Can't remember her last name) was absolutely accommodating and friendly, she stopped at our table to make sure our expectations were exceeded!! 
Congratulations to the Hakkasan team, we can't wait to be back!!!"
"Overall OK food, OK service and OK atmosphere. However at around $120 a head I feel it was overpriced and a simply not worth the money. $44 for crispy shredded beef! Needs to be something good! however it was just crispy shredded beef the same as you could order elsewhere for $10. Yes, the service was ok (although they forgot a dish a we had to ask and wait) and the decor and surroundings were good but the food simply was not anything special. The food was a let down, it was just OK, that's it! I walked away feeling let down rather than wow that Chinese was great!"
"We loved the food, ask your waiter what they recommend and then order it for sure. They told us the most popular dishes and they were wonderful. The wine list is awesome and we loved the vibe. Very south beach and very loud, dark and fun. Will return again for sure."
The sea bass was wonderful and I couldn't help looking at other tables to see all the artistic work the chef did to make each plate so enticing and delicious.  We also really enjoyed the vegetarian Dim Sum.
"Great atmosphere, great food and amazing Service! From the moment you come in the service is excellent, the bar is right there in the middle of all theaction.  Food was very good and the desserts where spectacular."
"The food was okay.
But the service was wonderful and the decor is unlike the usual Chinese restaurant.
We ordered the dim sum steamer in sea food. That was the only one we really liked.
The Champaign bass: you can still taste the alcohol, which is not the way to cook it, as it left a strange bitter taste to the otherwise delicate dish.
The pineapple prawns: at best fusion-hawaiian, not at all Chinese. it was more showy than delicious. 
The tea: very disappointing. We expected at least average selection of tea in such a posh place, but they just had generic oolong, jasmine, darjeeling, etc.
However, as mentioned earlier, the wait staff was very knowledgeable and curtious. 
The decor is mostly Chinese divider screens backed with different colored lighting. 
The overall feeling is intimate and modern."
"It is not often at all that I give a restaurant a 5-star rating, but there are numerous reasons Hakkasan has earned a 5-point rating from me.

Service: The service we received was high quality and what should be expected from a restaurant charging the prices this restaurant charges.  For instance, a staff member may see you standing up looking lost and promptly ask how they may be of service...then guide you to the restrooms and actually hold the entry door for you.  Attentive service means drinks are always full and you feel like you are the only table that waiter is attending.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere is rich, fun, festive, and upbeat.  We enjoyed drinks at the lovely, funky bar and then dinner in the dining area.  The labyrinth structure of the dining area allows for ample privacy. 

Pacing: The appetizers and main courses were paced perfectly.  Enough space was enjoyed between deliveries to savor the meals but not too much time elapsed to become bored / restless.

Food: The food is tasty, creative and just a little edgy.  The presentation is flawless and the temperatures perfect.  The food was not over-seasoned and prepared ""just right.""

I would recommend this restaurant highly for anyone entertaining clients or even for a great date night."
"We had only one night in Miami
We are thankful we chose Hakkasan.
The service,the delightful conversation with the knowledgable sommelier,the ambiance and the gourmet food, dim sum and Chiiean Sea bass were top notch.
Hope one day they open in Los Angeles"
Food is good. ambience would be a lot nicer of they would keep the sound level of the 'music' normal.
Meal was expensive and not super filling but the quality of the food was excellent
"Briefly, the food was amazing and the coctails very nice. Quite pricy but not too bad if you are careful. Must have the ribs!!"
"Hakkasan is a very pricey Oriental restaurant in the Fountainbleau Hotel on Miami Beach.  Even my husband, who hates pretentious restaurants, loved it because of its unusual offerings and unique preparations.  However, this time, most of the unusual seafood was gone from the menu, service was rushed and the food was just OK.  Certainly, everyone agreed dinner did not warrant the very high prices.  It's off my list of places to go."
"I've been to the one in London. This one is equally good, minus the jet lag. Innovative menu, amazing dishes. Chinese food kicked up several notches. Trendy bar, nice wine list."
"Pro's : good food, very tastfull and fresh. 

Negative side : dirty chopsticks, dirty plate, dirty tea cups, waiters not well aware about what they serve. 

Still far away from a michelin star. 

The london based and mumbai based are much better."
Vegetarian dishes were good. You have to make a reservation to avoid waiting. The service is excellent.
"Ate here twice in four days while at a conference. The dishes were extremely good, delicately flavored and nicely presented. I especially loved the Dim Sum plate, which was all dumplings of one kind or another. The second night I had the Steamed Red Snapper in spicy soya bean, which was delicious. They had a reasonable selection of gluten-free dishes and service was excellent.
The only part that would have hurt, if not for the expense account, was the bill. Like everything else in the Fontainebleu it was expensive but I think worth it."
"Everyone at the Fontainbleau will tell you this is the best place to go. They must be on commission because it's totally over rated. They have a great bar and delicious cocktails. As with all restaurants in Miami sexy girls in tight dresses meet you and if you're lucky will serve your food and drinks. For most of them it seems like such a chore! We had a young guy serve our table who could not have cared less. The atmosphere was not nearly as trendy and hip as the hype would have you believe. Our dinners were split 50/50- one was great (beef tenderloin bits) and the other was awful (prawn). They gave us a free desert because we were so unhappy with the shrimp but that means very little when you shell out over $200 for chinese food easily replicated else where. 

Skip this And try 1500 degrees at Eden Rock- much better meal and service."
It is pricey but good. Cool atmosphere and Vibe. Make reservations ahead.
"Amazing food, let the waiter set your menu and you´ll be amazed!"
I sneak here as I try to get away from Boat Show frenzy in February. Béen here three times and it is magnificent!
"We chose to eat from the Miami Spice menu, which was $35 per person for three courses.
The restaurant itself is very dark and moody, but the service was helpful and friendly and not at all rushed. 

We also opted to try one of the wine special offers - for an additional $20, we got a Bellini on arrival followed by a small glass of white and a small glass of red wine with our meals, all of which were very good.

The food was wonderful, our starter of chicken thighs was tender and the prawns in wheat flakes were beautifully cooked and moist.   The chocolate mousse dessert was also delicious.  The dishes didn't look much but we were nicely full after the whole meal.  

The bill was $75 per person including tax and service, certainly the priciest meal of our holiday, but also my favourite.  The whole experience was a lovely treat on our last night in Miami and I now want to try Hakkasan in London."
We went during our trip the weekend after Labor Day and had the dim sum brunch.  The food was amazing and the service was very attentive.  I highly recommend getting the crispy pan fried noodles vs. the fried rice.  I would definitely come back again. P.s. go during Miami Spice season for a discount!
"Hakkasan Miami is based in the beautiful Fontainebleau Hotel. Our table wasn’t quite ready so we sat at the bar and enjoyed a beautiful pre dinner drink at the stunning bar. The bar staff were really friendly and poured a great drink!
We were seated at a really lovely table and decided to choose from the Miami Spice menu. This was a special offer running from August-September at $35 per head (excluding tax and gratuity). To start with we both opted for the vegetable spring rolls – simply AMAZING! 
For main you pick 3 dishes to share between two people, we had some vegetable rice, seasonal vegetables in oyster sauce and the most tantalising beef dish I have ever tasted! It was similar to braising steak in a chilli and something sauce – it was delicious and just melted in your mouth. There was a lot of food and like all places in America the portions were really generous we didn’t finish everything- alongside this we also had a great bottle of Malbec at $40.
For desert it was a chocolate mousse with a cookie and vanilla ice cream with raspberries and raspberry puree, heaven!!
Would love to go back next time I’m in Miami and will most certainly be visiting both restaurants in London!"
"Surprised this restaurant doesn't feature higher on the ratings lists. A wonderful meal here, and you have to try the desserts!  On the pricey side, but if you want to impress then a definite recommendation.  Portions are of a good size, but not overwhelming.  Staff are a little direct though.
A drink in the hotel is recommended, even if just to people watch."
"From the beginning the service was unpleasant; the waiter was slow and was not knowledgeable about the wines and their own menu… we ordered Sea Bass as our main course and they served us “FISH STICKS” (It was fried fish sticks in a sweet and sour sauce – terribly presented) I guess they thought we wouldn’t notice the difference. We’ve worked in the hospitality industries for several years and never experience such bad quality in food.
 
We complaint and it fell on deaf ears. We will never return."
"You MUST try their Weekend Lunch  Dim Sum! Take advantage of the Spice Menu While it lasts, it is such a GREAT Value!.. The Food is amazing, left soo full and satisfied!.. Pefect Ambiance, Service was excellent and accomodating (my lady has food allergies, and they brought her out her own entree and still honored the Spice price) Couldnt be more pleased with the experince. Will def. return!  GO HERE!  (See pics)"
"the food was tasty but it was so overpriced it left a bad taste in my mouth
not worth the price"
"Steve our server was superb - helped us find just the right meal for us. He had great reccomendations and was very efficient.

The ribs and duck roll are fantastic to start.

The meal filled us up to the brim, we shared a main along with a rice and noodle dish.

For a cocktail have The Hakka - very drinkable.

Great setting, very intimate for couples, we took our baby along in his stroller and he slept right through!

Thanks for a great evening - our favourite while in Miami and the Fontainebleu."
"We frequently visit London Hakkasans and were excited to visit Fontainebleau's Hakkasan. The atmosphere is great and the service is really good - friendly and chatty. It felt more informal and less pretentious than London can be which was good. But the food just wasn't up to London's high standards. 

We didn't go for the Miami Spice menu and in hindsight we should have as it's really good value for money. 

Enjoyable meal and overall a nice experience but if only the food was that bit better."
Too fast-paced for such a nice restaurant. I expect to eat at a leisurely pace at a restaurant like this.
"I was invited by my brother and his wife for dinner last week while visiting Florida, he knows I really like Chinese food and asked me if i had ever been to Hakkasan, when i said no he imediately reserved a table for us and some friends...the whole concept is a winner, the bar is awesome, the music loud enough were you can continue a conversation, exellent service and the best orental food I have had in South Florida. I would recommend family or friends to go and enjoy this palce, not cheap but really worth it !!!"
"great food and service washed down with great wine!

I would recommend to anyone!"
"Great dimsum and nothing like those American Chinese places. This one is helmed by a chef from Singapore.

A good alternative if you want good Chinese food which is so rare in this city.

My favorite (though not a typical chinese dish in US) is actually the fish congee."
"After having read some of the other reviews posted here, I'm quite surprise that the food comments are coming out so-so.  I've dined at Hakkasan 3 times, and all three times the food was absolutely wonderful. By far the best high end Chinese food in Miami Beach (must better quality food than Mr. Chow at the W Hotel or Phillipe at the Gansavoort).  The dishes are super fresh, well prepared, piping hot and tasty to boot. The ambiance is very nice, music is funky, staff is friendly. A ""highly recommended"" in my books"
"I have eaten here twice and can't understand some negative reviews.  It is true that the food is not too cutting edge but that is fine. The quality of the food and the depth of flavor improve familiar dishes . I have had the dumpling appetizer twice and both times they were good. Have tried fish, beef and chicken for main dishes. The chicken and fish are the clear winners. The beef dishes are the most expensive and the most disappointing. I Recommend the house speciality drinks, as many are made with fresh fruit, not juices or purees.  The service is professional - maybe a bit distant, as the 18% tip is included.
 The prices are in line with other fine restaurants and some items (especially mixed drinks) are a relative bargain."
"We made reservations at Hakkasan after reading an article saying it had amazing food and an incredible atmosphere and it was THE place in South Beach for celebrity sightings.  We enjoy spoiling ourselves from time to time and thought this would be a great place to do so in South Beach. We checked out the menu before going to make sure we'd have options - we're vegetarian/vegan and have found some nice restaurants have limited options.  Hakkasan didn't disappoint with both veggie and tofu options on the menu.  When we arrived, we were immediately struck by the ambiance and experience.  Beautiful restaurant!  The service, however, was lacking.  Our waitress didn't explain anything on the menu - most importantly, she left out the fact that food is ordered family style and a la carte.  After many questions (and honestly, feeling a bit stupid while ordering), we finally settled on the tofu claypot with black bean sauce, veggie fried rice, and fried beans.  We started with the wild mushroom lettuce wrap as well.  The food was amazing.  Those four things were more than enough for two people (although my hungry husband managed to finish it all!).  Our drinks were great too.  All the food and two drinks (plus the included 18% gratuity) amounted to $128.  The food was worth it - if you can look past the service."
"My wife and I travel a lot around the world for business as well as pleasure.
We love the wonderfull things in life that gives us great comfort and experiences.
Offcourse as we experienced Hakkasan in London, we couldn't leave the opportunity to visit Hakkasan in Miami.
Unfortunately the restaurant was fully booked (make sure you make reservations on time)!

Still we decided to go and give it à shot.. Likely the restaurant was packed with all different kind of people looking really satisfied and enjoying the great atmosphere!

Although the staff had every right to refuse us as we didn't made a reservation. They offerde us a seat at the bar, hoping for a cancellation.

When their was none cancellations, the manager friendly requested us to stay for dinner at the bar. He offered us 2 drinks and desert for free as a gesture! Which was great and not necessary as we didn't made any reservation.

We experience Hakkasan again as a wonderfull restaurant with great atmosphere, highly trained staff and a fantastic menu.
You can't miss this wonderfull place when you visit Miami!!

Greetings of 2 lovebirds both working in fashion"
"We're from the NYC area and love good dim sum, which is very hard to find outside Chinese communities. So I was skeptical when my wife made reservations at Hakkasan in the  Fontainebleau Hotel.

I was delitefully surprised - the classic dim sums as good as you'll find in Chinatowns and we also ordered the Snow Pea Shoots, which was a real treat and an order of Yang Chow Fried Rice, which was the only mild disappointment, since they added soy sauce to the rice apparently to appease the taste of the mostly Caucasian clientele (most real Chinese fried rice does not add soy sauce...)

The service was very good and, as is typical in Miami Beach, they added 18% to the bill (apparently many foreigners assume service is already included, so they never tip, and all the restaurants have responded by adding tips to the bill) - even so, four of us had a nice lunch for less that $90, all included."
"i went twice on my trip to Miami (4 nights).  Absolutely fantastic food and even better service received from Greg at the bar (ate at the bar).   Greg remembered my name, itinerary and drink order on the return trip, 4 nights later.   

clay pot grouper remarkable, and the ribs appetizer was absolutely incredible. crispy duck roll also good.

Truly a fantastic restaurant and puts t's sister restaurant in the hotel (Gotham Steak) to shame."
"We went there for lunch on Sunday.  They serve Chinese dim sum on the weekends.  The dim sum menu was carefully chosen.  It had a good variety of meat, seafood and vegetables.  Everything was delicious.  First class service.   After lunch, we walked out to the balcony.  It is over 1000 Square feet and had a beautiful ocean view.  Very nice experience."
"I was told it was the best chinese in miami: this is absolutely wrong, the food is not better than a delivery, the setting and service are nice but you will pay for it!! If you want a chinese rest in miami go to Tropical chinese which is much better and much much less expensive."
"We were a party of six and tried many dishes from the menu's extensive list. The food is nouvelle chinese cuisine very well interpreted and presented. Everything (ingredients, recipes and presentation) was perfect. Good wine list at acceptable cost. Service very good. Location very elegant."
"My husband and I are big foodies and were really excited to try this place.  Upon entering, the decor was really beautiful, but from there the rest went downhill.  Went to the bar for cocktails, I had a great mixed drink.  My husband ordered a Redbull, because he couldn't have alcohol.  The bartender told him this was an upscale cocktail bar & they did not offer energy drinks.  So he ordered a Diet Coke in which she brought out a Diet Pepsi, not even saying it was not Coke but pouring anyway.  Everyone knows you either like Coke or Pepsi, not both and you need to let the customer know and make sure it is ok.   For an upscale property, why Pepsi? That is so not upscale!!  But anyways, sat for dinner ordered a few items that were recommended from the internet and friends - Jasmine Ribs & Dim Sum.  Food was good but not great, not worth paying the $$$, not worth returning.  I sooo love Nobu, food is always excellent and makes you want to come back.  This place was a disappointment.  Overall, if you live in South Florida, it's worth it to check out and have a drink but save your money for a better meal elsewhere.  And of course, staff was impersonal and snooty.  Not what they need in this economy when people are spending their $$$$."
"Well worth the 45 minute drive from Deerfield Beach to experience a unique look at Chinese food.  My husband and I shared a dim sum platter with 3 sauces, then had stir fry scallops with lily bulb and yellow chives.  Who knew you could eat lily bulb?  It was actually sweet little petals, almost like an onion.  We also had duck and mustard greens which was good, the sauce was flavorful.  DO NOT MISS THE BANANA FONDANT AND ICE CREAM!  We will definitely return to try some other interesting things on the menu.  Service was attentive, the waiter always seemed to know when to come over without being annoying.  Worth a trip, worth the money."
"In the iconic Fontainebleau hotel, where Frank Sinatra stayed, Hakkasan is a must-see in Miami for both the beauty of the place and its frequentation. Outstanding Chinese cuisine in the restaurant, not affordable for all budgets. To date the best Chinese restaurant I've tried"
"The restaurant is nice and we enjoyed its food especially mango dessert.
In my review the prices are high for what they offer."
"Contrary to what I wrote about the Fontainebleau’s room service dishes, Hakkasan not only stands out as one of Miami’s best restaurants, which we confirm, but the bar’s spectacular decoration with the shifting golden dragon and its worldmusic make it a trendy, stylish and chic place. 
It deserves to be better highlighted by the hotel. You have to look for him at the end of the corridors and then go up to the 4th floor. Budget $$."
"Sensational restaurant with a fair price for what it serves, the food is excellent from starters to dessert and the service provided by Bruno."
"When we are in SoBe, a visit to Hakkasan is a must! Unfortunately, we were a little disappointed this time! The food is served at such a speed that you feel like you are at a speed food competition. The music is cool but unfortunately much too loud! Uncomfortable for dinner for two. The quality of the food feels like it has gone down a bit. We have eaten much better at Hakkasan. One positive thing to note is that the wine prices are reasonable compared to other restaurants in SoBe."
"Hakasan is a perfect restaurant. Pleasant decoration, refined and attentive service demonstrating the desire to please the customer. The food is wonderful. We were 5 people and we ordered a tasting. Some of us were allergic to certain foods that were carefully and appropriately replaced. Each dish was beautifully presented and delicious. Although it is an expensive restaurant, it is worth it because the experience is exceptional.
A night to remember."
"I was at Hakkasan for dinner on December 31st, well cooked dishes even if too abundant, exquisite duck, very nice place with soft lights but the level of service for a restaurant of this kind needs to improve a lot: the cutlery doesn't change, they ask you to pass the dishes etc."
Excellent dinner. We received very good advice from STAFFORD. The explanations and suggestions for dishes were very professional. He hit the nail on the head. Great character. I recommend this restaurant and on my next trip we will definitely return there with great pleasure. Thank you for everything. ROBERT family
"Super nice cozy atmosphere.
A warm and efficient welcome.
Refined and delicious cuisine, as is often the case in the USA, don't hesitate to take a side dish for two because they are plentiful.
We had a blast!"
