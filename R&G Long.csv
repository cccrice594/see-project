review
"Slightly underwhelming so order carefully as  trading a little on it’s laurels. Don’t have the beef special which they seem to force on everyone. It was bland and deep fried fodder for tourists only I feel.

The waitress was polite but was pushing all the same quick tasteless dishes to all who had come due reading or seeing it on Anthony Bourdain show. 

The duck and pancakes was v nice however as was the one vegetable dish. 

Saw some locals order more vibrant dishes of scallops and greens so there is good food there but it’s not what they push in the restaurant. 

The chilli crab looked similarly deep fried and very glad didn’t have that as it was also pushed by waitress. 

So choose any duck dish and avoid the deep fried overly American gunk. 

Shame as I was really looking forward to it."
"We wanted to eat local Chinese while we were in Chinatown, and found this place by googling what was close by. We were pleasantly surprised. It was super delicious! We got salmon avocado egg rolls, Prawns with honey walnuts, r & g special beef, Golden supreme fried rice, baked black cod, and chow mien . It was all delicious!"
"In September my husband and I ate at R&G Lounge in Chinatown. I had read a number of reviews of different restaurants and settled on this one. I was impressed that Anthony Bourdain had been there and I wanted to try authentic Chinese food. We were a bit disappointed with our meals, but that might be because perhaps we don’t really care for authentic Chinese food like I thought we would. I had the Special Beef and it was good, but not remarkable. My husband had Mu Shu pork and did not enjoy it. I did think that the vegetable egg rolls were fabulous, however. So I’m glad we went there because my goal was to try authentic Chinese food, but I don’t think we will return. I’m sure people with more of a taste for authentic Chinese food would really enjoy it."
"Very disappointed with the quality of the food we ate here. We had been recommended to go to this restaurant by our Chinese Uber driver so we had high hopes. However the food was mediocre at best. We ordered the salt and pepper ribs and they were mainly batter and gristle with very little meat. The meat that was there was pink and undercooked. We ended up sending them back as they were inedible. The chicken chow mein had no beansprouts, just noodles, spring onions and chicken but it was bland and tasteless. The chicken and cashew nuts was again bland and hardly had any sauce at all. The satay sticks were undercooked and therefore we felt nervous about eating them. We saw that there were many Chinese people eating in there and so were surprised by the low quality of the food. Will not be recommending it to anyone visiting San Francisco and am disappointed we wasted our precious time going there."
"We booked a table for 8 people for 7.30 had to wait until 8.10 to be seated ordered starters which included crispy duck, vegetable  spring rolls, calamari and spare ribs.
The springs rolls were bland and only had shredded cabbage, the ribs were so small and very bony. The duck didn’t arrive for another 20mins.
We were pressured to order our main course due to the kitchen closing and we were told they had no chicken left.
One of our main courses arrived and sat on its own for 10minutes then the duck arrived which was inedible,hardly any meat on it and lots of fat and bones( we sent that back)The pancakes had been microwaved and were all stuck together,impossible to pull apart.
Our remaining dishes arrived however our starter plates hadn’t been cleared and we weren’t offers clean plates. The portions have shrunk considerably in recent times and we were looking forward to having the sticky chicken.
The service was very poor and we felt like it had been a long service and we were at the end of it.
We’d heard that R & G have opened another restaurant on the harbour and we hope this isn’t the reason for the drop in standards."
This restaurant has a great menu selection ranging from tradional to more exotic.  The food was excellent.  The place was on the small side given its stature but it is tastefully decorated.  Price was slightly more expensive.  Parking is readily available at the Portsmouth Square Plaza Garage in the next block.
"Went for a late dinner. Were given an appropriate table with lots of room in a quieter area (we were with our baby in a stroller).  Our waiter was very attentive: explained food ingredients and gave us the market price on abalone we ordered, without being asked.  All the food was amazing, we got the right amount of attention from the staff and we weren't rushed out in spite of being among the last guests.  Recommend highly."
"Three plates two people and two large men leave stuffed. I always wish we could try more. Salt and Pepper Crab and the Miso Black Cod, we add a vegetable, often the Green Beans, but sometimes another.

They have lots of high-end delicacies here including live fish and shrimp. Always crowded with a line, going at off hours can pay off. 

Do not expect the Chinese food from the mall. Do not expect the same old. You can drop a lot of money here so know what you are doing.

Can't wait for my next crab! My favorite preparation for Dungeness crab anywhere."
"It was a busy service with dozens of people at the entrance - many waiting for takeaway but quite a lot for their table. They were running about 20-30 mins late seating people but it was a busy July 4th weekend.

Once at the table the menu was lovely, great choices and good service. I’m not a fan of appetisers and mains arriving all at the same time as and when made but that’s personal preference. Be aware that’s the practice and then plan around it. 

The kung pao chicken and king sized prawns were divine."
"Excellent Chinese place that was recommended by our hotel. We had the fried rice with seafood, and the R&G special beef dish which had a unique sweetness due to the long marinade to it that was unique and outstanding. All the food was excellent and the staff was also very nice, helpful and quick to bring the food to the table. It’s worthwhile to mention that the hot tea that comes with the meal is also excellent."
"typical Cantonese established restaurant that is an excellent option for Chinese food in Chinatown. Service bordered on being obnoxious but the quality of food made up for the lack of service. Must try: stir fry beef with veggies & mushroom, as well as the fried rice with a lovely wok fried scent."
"Looking for a good Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, we were recommended to this one by someone at out hotel.  The restaurant does not have individual dishes, and the seafood rice is a waste of money if you order it, like I did.  If everyone in the group likers the same things, it may work, but in my case, my wife and daughter have different preferences than mine, so this is to me a sure no return place to eat.  Service was just ok. Clean place, prices fine."
"What a meal. Six of us went and each ordered a different menu option. The sea bass was incredible, the noodles were fantastic, and each course was a new favorite item we have eaten so far.
The menu is vast, so ask the staff for assistance and you cannot go wrong."
"Overpriced and rude too minimal service. The food was not great my honey soy orange chicken was dry, my partners cashew nut chicken,
‘S sauce wasn’t great.

We had to ask for our order to be taken, remind them to bring rice, ask for the bill and they only take credit card.

I would find another Chinese restaurant, there are plenty to choose from."
"Spent a long time researching and looking at the many restaurants in SF Chinatown. We’re so glad we settled on R&G. Others had similar TA ratings but were nowhere near as classy. We even went into one (and left after receiving the menus) where we saw two mice running around. We pointed this out to the staff who didn’t seem very bothered by this. By contrast,  the staff at R&G were all friendly, helpful and professional. The waiters all wore waistcoats and advised us on dishes we might like. We were automatically given a pot of tea when we sat down and water throughout the meal. The food portions were huge and the recommended dishes were very tasty. The service was exceptional. I very strongly recommend you eat here."
"We did four Takeout dishes...a black cod, Kung pai chicken, water chestnuts, snow peas and other veggies, and another chicken dish.  Except for the veggies, all were spicy hot...and all were delicious.  Excellent Chinese."
"I had read a great deal about the place online, some mixed reviews but mainly very positive. I visited with my daughter on the 30th June, 2024 as part of our trip to SF. There was a HUGE queue outside, may people had left their names and were awaiting being called upon. We registered at the desk for a table for two and were immediately invited downstairs - the others waiting were larger groups.

We were seated quickly and our waiter attending very promptly - he was friendly and patient but efficient. We both ordered a soup followed by a main course and the soup arrived very quickly and was tasty. The mains arrived uncoordinated which was a minor thing with my daughter eating first and my dish came later. Honestly, not a big deal though it was a little unusual it didn’t affect our experience.

The food was really good. Not too salty as can be the case with Chinese. I had the Szechuan pork which was outstanding. So flavoursome, with a rich and lightly oily chilli flavour. Really good. All in all, this is one of the best meals I have had out in some time. A fast and efficient experience which might not suit everyone but we loved it. When we do come back to SF, we will visit again."
"Wonderful staff and great tasting food.  My husband ordered their famous salt and pepper crab, and said it was the best crab he has ever had.  I had the cashew chicken, and it was cooked perfectly.  We will definitely go back next time we are in San Francisco."
"We had a super enjoyable meal at this super popular restaurant on the edge of San Francisco’s Chinatown.  My husband and I turned up on Lunar New Year’s Day without a booking, but didn’t have to wait long as we were prepared to sit at one of the high tables on stools.  We ordered a wild mushroom chow mein and the beef brisket and turnip clay pot!  They were both super delicious – there was a generous portion of mixed Asian mushrooms in the chow mein and the beef brisket was really flavoursome and juicy.  As mentioned in the reviews, it is a little on the pricey side – but the food is really good!!"
We ordered the Lunar New Year menu. We had 6 family members for dinner and we ordered the Dragon Prix Fixe menu plus 1/2 order of the Peking duck. The meal was excellent and the staff very friendly. Very happy with the quality of the dishes.
"This is my first time eating at this restaurant, and my overall experience was poor! Our waiter was not very attentive and never checked on us to see if we needed anything or how the meal was! I ordered the R & G special BF, and it was lukewarm at best and bland with no favor! We also ordered fried rice, and it was lukewarm at best! My wife ordered Kung pao chicken, and it was good! Our waiter decided to eat his lunch/dinner, and he sat at a table next to us with several other employees eating their meal as well! Instead of our waiter giving us the bill and checking on us, he ignored us! What was very interesting is that their rice was steaming hot with steam coming off the rice vs. ours being lukewarm!  The other thing is they allowed a regular dog inside the restaurant and it  sitting a few feet from us! I believe it's not allowed according to California law!' The overall experience was poor! We won't be coming back! Also,  parking is difficult to find!,Hi ET1976, I am sorry that we were not able to give you a 5-star experience. The R&G beef is our top seller and it's very rare that someone says it was bland, so we apologize for that. We make everything to order so if it wasn't hot enough, we could've brought it back to make it hotter/recook it had we known there was an issue at the time. Unfortunately we do not have space for a private lunch room for employees so they do take their lunches at tables that are available. California law, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), requires restaurants to allow service animals in all areas where the public is normally permitted. This includes the indoor dining room. Restaurants cannot refuse service or isolate customers who have service animals. This guest told us their dog is a service dog, and restaurants are not allowed to ask for proof of disability or certification for the service dog. We hope this helps clear things up, thank you.

While in San Francisco we decide to China Town for lunch.  After looking at reviews many for the recommendations were closed or no longer serving lunch due to COVID.  After walking for a while we found R&G.  Food and service were excellent
"Lacking thrills and decorum and rather crowded and multi room but the service, food, promptness, ingredients to the extend that we understand or surmise- most acceptable. The vegetables and the fried rice were sublime. The prawns and the chicken less so. The character of the serving with the beer in can not to uour complete liking. The mille-feuille paper cloth was interesting. The had several layers of on the table, removing one instead of reclothing the tavle. Efficient and of good character and with a family cjaracter in the waiting.  Along Kearny street a discreetly location culinary jewel."
"We came for the duck and then ordered some veggies and honey walnut shrimp. Everything seemed to be pretty standard, including the duck. I don't think it was as impressive as I would have wanted. The tables of regulars around us had other dishes on the table and seemed to know exactly what to get and none of it was peking duck. So maybe skip it - pricey as well"
"We went there as family for dinner. We had reservations but still waited about 30 minutes. It’s a very busy, popular place.  We had the fried crab, green beans, crispy chicken, stir fry rice, and a pork dish. The fried food was very greasy but had good flavor. The restaurant is extremely noisy especially when they clear a table. This makes it difficult to have a conversation. I didn’t feel the good was worth all the noise"
"Clearly popular with many diners, but not this one.

Tea was served as soon as I sat down.  Ordered a beer to start and this arrived very quickly.   Ordered Hot and Sour Soup, followed by Combination Seafood Garlic Noodles.   Service was prompt despite a busy dining room and entrance area.   Sadly the soup was thin and watery, hot but not sour.  The Noodles were coated with too much cooking oil.  The seafood was good but not plentiful.

Other tables were served with Dungenness crab that looked delicious so maybe I didn't choose wisely.

Clearly a very popular restaurant in San Francisco Chinatown"
"Every person we encountered on our trip recommended this place and they were spot on! The staff was courteous and attentive. The atmosphere was cozy and laid back with several large parties enjoying fellowship with their meal. 
The food is the main attraction. I had the chef special beef and my wife had the honey/garlic chicken. Both meals were amazing."
"Went to this mighty restaurant twice in a 4 day SF getaway weekend — so good. May not look like much from the street (or even inside) but hands down some of the best Chinese food we’ve ever had (and we’ve tried a lot!).  The service is outstanding, especially given how many people they are serving at any given moment.  Seems like a favorite place for local folks in the know. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful.  Loved the sautéed prawns and snow peas on XO sauce.  Will definitely come again next time we’re in town."
"We went here as it was close to our hotel & was recommended to us - it was really busy, but we managed to get a small table. I only had the hot & sour soup, which was really good, & my friend had a main meal which was also very good.
Certainly not fine dining, but for a quick meal, I'd go back."
"My wife and I arrived around 2:15pm.  After a suggestion from our tour guide.  Upstairs we were greeted right away, and asked to go downstairs to the dining room.  There we were greeted right away and seated.  Our server, along with every other employee that we made contact with during our visit, treated us very well.  Quite friendly, and made us feel right at home.  I ordered the R & G special beef.(special recipe). It looked good, and it tasted good.  Not a wow moment, but still tasty.  Not really enough flavor for me.  I would not order that again.  My wife ordered the diced honey garlic chicken.. That was quite tasty.  Much more flavor.  We had a wonderful visit, and were treated great.  I would certainly love to visit again."
Excellent - really enjoyed this meal.  RG special beef is a must - soy sauce beef fried dry like a jerky. Great. We had a dungeoness crab w scallion ginger - was awesome.  Pan fried hk style noodle was great.  Shrimp w honey walnut was great.  Highly recommend.  Would go back again. This place was packed!!!!
"We were walking to another restaurant and passed by R&G. We figured with a lot of people waiting, it must be good. Only a 15 minute wait and bartender gave us huge wine pours. With only two of us, we only sampled a few dishes and they were great: Salt and Pepper Scallops and eggplant. Lots of people were eating the dungeness crab. While it looked good, just too much work for me. Excellent!,Great feedback Fred! We're happy to hear this and we appreciate your support. Lucy - Captain - info@rnglounge.com"
"Family showed for dinner.  Waited over a hour not seated. Noticed entry appeared dirty and bartender kept picking his nose.  Ask to look at dining area.  Notice area was dirty.  Noticed waitress kept seating Asians who appeared at door without reservations.  We left because of rude service and dirtiness of restaurant.  Appeared place is not the hype and overrated.  Eventually, we ate at Great Eastern Restaurant."
"We arrived for dinner at 4:50 pm on a Thursday.  By 5:30 pm, the entire restauant was full.  The food was yummy.  We shared: the diced honey garlic chicken; the beer chow fun; and prawns with scrambled eggs.  The food was delicious.  The service was solid.,Thank you for stopping in and giving us a shot TravelingGuy60! We're happy to hear this and we hope you'll stop back in the next time you're in our neighborhood.

"Went here for lunch today. Solid food and solid service. Had the salt and pepper Dungeness crab, marinated half chicken and the triple mushroom vegetable. Very good overall. Good prices for a major city."
"In the Chinatown district of San Fransisco we where recommend to this restaurant. It is at the bottom of Chinatown where it looks a bit desolated. 
Once we where inside it was fantastic. My husband ordered the crab and I ordered the Peking duck pancakes. These are very generous servings so there is no need to order entree. Our waiter was fantastic and we walked away very happy and content with our choice. Highly recommended"
"We had pre-booked a banquet for our family of 8.  We had a private room, great service, and excellent food (we had pre-arranged the menu).  Highlights were the seafood - lobster and crab.  I thought the value was excellent given the food (great taste and much more than we could eat) and service."
"a minute ago

NEW

I was traveling to San Francisco for the first time and on the evening of my arrival I walked around to check out the area around my hotel. I came across this restaurant and decided to go in. I was alone and was able to be seated at a high top table by the bar right away. My server did not speak a lot of English but he provided very good service . I ordered a pear martini which was fantastic and the shrimp chow mein. It was delicious. The atmosphere was lively with folks having a good time at the bar. Everything was great and I look forward to coming back here on my next visit to SF."
Heard good reviews and decided to take my wife. Was not disappointed. We shared the Spicy Mongolian Beef and the Chow Mein. They were both amazing! The staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. A must stop while visiting Chinatown or Coit Tower that's nearby.
"We visited this restaurant for lunch on our last day in San Francisco. The food was excellent and reasonably priced for the lunch menu. I would recommend the spring rolls. The mains were delicious and portions were huge. I had the children in honey sauce, which was amazing."
Booked supper here which was a good idea as it filled up quickly. Delicious authentic food / restaurant/decor etc. Arrived on the table when it was ready rather than waiting  in the kitchen. Service with a smile. It was fantastic.
"While visiting San Francisco, wanted something in Chinatown, with a twist. We had wonderful experience here. Attentive service: which is hard to find in eating establishments. Had the salt and pepper Dungeness crab which was delicious."
"I visited San Francisco this fall for the first time and walked Chinatown. One of my recommended restaurants was R&G. The restaurant was very busy, but I got a table immediately. My spareribs was very tasty and had a crisp to it. I regret not revisiting this restaurant during my 3 day stay. The restaurant was casual and good for an everyday lunch or dinner."
"The calamari and the fried rice were amazing. The bartender. Louie, was seriously one of the most outstanding I have ever seen. He engaged every customer and he obviously loves his job. You rarely see service like this anymore. Go see Louie at the bar… I guarantee he’ll make you smile."
Ok this is quite authentic Chinese. It was very busy. The food came out randomly. The satay beef was inedible. The service was friendly but slightly odd. I had to run home as it gave me an upset stomach.
The food was terrible.  The peking duck was undercooked.  The soy chicken was cold and we had to send it back for them to warm it.  We found a gnat in our food and they just blew it off.
"Probably the best Asian cuisine I’ve eaten. Many options and well cooked, served by polite staff. Can really recommend this one for its food."
"Based on the raving reviews we decided to have dinner at R&G Lounge. Despite our reservation we had to wait for over 20 minutes to be seated. Our table was located in the corner of the smelly cellar. Service was super fast, food was unfortunately mediocre. We liked the fresh vegetables and the fish noodles, the honey chicken was so-so (a bit dry, like they kept the dish warm for too long) and the duck was a disappointment. Though tender, it was too greasy. We love Chinese food and know what it should be like, this was just mediocre."
"Good chinese, local food, too casual for us, noisy. Good but not good enough to consider going back."
We were a group of 15 and really enjoyed ourselves.  The food was delicious.  It isn't a very big place so I would recommend booking reservations.
We had the secret recipe been and the chicken cashews - both dishes were wonderful and delicious. Best cashew chicken  ever
"This is our go to place for the last 20 years it has a very extensive menu and will always deliver in all areas from service, food and ambience!!"
Dirty. Awful atmosphere. Mediocre food. Dining room is in the basement with no ventilation and it smells nasty. The bathrooms were disgustingly dirty. I could see into the kitchen through an open door; it was not at all clean looking.
"We got seaweed salad, which was wonderful, and a duck and a seafood entree.  The place was packed but we still got our food in a reasonable time."
"Food was very average. All three meals came out separately over a 20 minute period and the rice never arrived for which the waiter offered no explanation or apology and was quite arrogant. 
Not impressed to say the least"
"We had garlic steamed Dungeness crab and vegetable fried rice.  Cannot say enough about how good these dishes were!  Go, you'll love it."
Fantastic. Really. Very very good Chinese. This can run circles around Mr. Chow any time (in Beverly Hills where we were last week). Really very good food. Also the Peking Duck. Service very good too.
"Think my first time dining at R & G was like 9 or 10 years ago, along with friends who flew in from Vancouver, and us from Hong Kong. Eversince then, I will always make sure to pay a visit to R & G with my Co workers from Hong Kong each time I flew to San Francisco. If someone who's base in Hong Kong, which is well-known as chinese culinary paradise city would repeatedly patronise an overseas Chinese restaurant in Chinatown (which we try our best not to) , then it got to be evidently and consistently good! This time we went for lunch, just 2 of us so we ordered 

~Half Crispy chicken 😋😋😋
~Double Boiled Soup of the Day, 😋😋😋
~Dry Chili Jumbo Prawns😋😋😋
~Stir-fried Pea Greens😋😋😋

Five stars to all dishes we ordered! Especially the double boiled ginseng chicken soup! Lady server was kind enough to stop us from ordering more food because the portions are big. And she always check on us but not abruptly . Wine list has excellent choices too, and their Napa wines were pretty reasonable! 👍👍👍"
"Ordered a half Peking duck to go.
Must have been the smallest and skinniest duck in California.
All skin, fat and bones.
$30 wasted."
"The food was great - we ordered the seafood combo claypot, honey spare ribs and fried rice, all were delicious! The weather was perfect for outdoor dining. Definitely would recommend this restaurant for lunch after walking around China town."
"We asked a colleague in San Fran to recommend authentic Asian food, and this restaurant was terrific. He ordered us to ask to sit downstairs, and thats definitely where the action is. The place is small but was packed and bustling. I had a great ginger cocktail and the food was delish!"
"In the Chinatown district of San Fransisco we where recommend to this restaurant. It is at the bottom of Chinatown where it looks a bit desolated. 
Once we where inside it was fantastic. My husband ordered the crab and I ordered the Peking duck pancakes. These are very generous servings so there is no need to order entree. Our waiter was fantastic and we walked away very happy and content with our choice. Highly recommended"
"typical Cantonese established restaurant that is an excellent option for Chinese food in Chinatown. Service bordered on being obnoxious but the quality of food made up for the lack of service. Must try: stir fry beef with veggies & mushroom, as well as the fried rice with a lovely wok fried scent."
"Very disappointed with the quality of the food we ate here. We had been recommended to go to this restaurant by our Chinese Uber driver so we had high hopes. However the food was mediocre at best.

We saw that there were many Chinese people eating in there and so were surprised by the low quality of the food. Will not be recommending it to anyone visiting San Francisco and am disappointed we wasted our precious time going there."
"Stop in for lunch after reading the Bourdain loved this spot, and I can see why.  The food was excellent."
"There was a hostess when I entered the building. I said “Lunch for one, please.” She very abruptly said “Downstairs!” So, I walked down the stairs to a dining room with mostly 4-person tables in addition to several large, round tables down the center. I was approached by a server and held up one finger. She directed me to an open seat at one of the large, round tables. Until this point, I had not realized that these were communal tables. 

I was almost immediately asked for my order. I asked the server for recommendations and chose one of the chef specialties: diced, garlic-honey chicken. I was not asked for my drink order. Like everyone else, I was automatically served a VERY hot tea in a tall, iced-tea glass. 

The chicken was tasty, although a bit too sweet for my taste. Service was great with the servers constantly buzzing around the room."
It is usually a good sign when the restaurant is full of locals and this is certainly true for R & G Lounge. The place doesn't look like much but the food is first rate. Get seafood! Lamb dishes are also good. Two very thin women next to us polished off a huge hard shell crab and entire fish with gusto. They will spice up a dish if you ask.
"R&G Lounge was recommended to us by a sales clerk at Canton Bazaar and it did not disappoint. The customers included plenty of Chinese locals—always a good sign. Our server, Stanley, was very helpful in steering us towards some of the more authentic dishes. Next time will have to try the crab!"
"Chicken & veg. was bland and tasteless. Fried rice also uninspired.  Black cod was excellent but pricy.  Stir fried pea shoots also excellent!  Looking around, some dishes looked wonderful, but others too Americanized and routine.  Order carefully, ask questions and demand answers and you can have an excellent meal."
"Nicely prepared Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab.  Staff was friendly, attentive and didn’t rush us as we took 2 hours to thoroughly enjoy our treat."
"Nothing can ever overcome BAD service.  We had been referred to R&G by several people.  Apparently they have a Michelin Star.  We were fortunate to walk in and have a short wait time...there are three levels of dining.  We were seated in the basement and the room was full.  The live crab looked to be a popular choice.  We waited a long time before being approached and then had to get someone in order to place our order.  There were no check-ins by the server, we had to request water which came at the end of our meal.  Quite frankly we felt discriminated against as it appeared other tables were receiving adequate attention and service.  The shrimp and pineapple friend rice has absolutely no flavor at all.  The garlic noodles and seafood was pretty much all noodles.  At least the wonton soup was very good.
We would not go back or recommend it."
"This restaurant has a history of centuries in downtown San Francisco.  Many yummy chinese dishes where you cannot find elsewhere. The chef ia marvellous.  Worth spending.
…"
"Wandering through China Town, I told my husband he had to check reviews before I would eat at any of the restaurants.  Wow! This was a very fortunate find.  The place was extremely busy.  They take reservations, which I would highly recommend.  While we were waiting for a table, we talked with some locals who told us that this restaurant is very well known and liked among locals.  While waiting at the very small bar, we enjoyed R & G's version of a Manhattan which included plum wine as an ingredient.  Very delicious!  We had the salmon and avocado egg roll which was divine.  The vegetarian egg roll was ok.  Mashed chicken and sweet corn soup was quite good.  We shared the ""Special Beef,"" which is one of their signature dishes.  It was delicious.  Didn't realize we had to order rice separately, but got it quickly once ordered.  Most tables seemed to be ordering R & G's other specialty dish, strangely called ""Live Crab with Salt & Pepper.""  Thankfully, nothing was moving on the plates going by.  The crabs were enormous, hanging off the dinner plates. The employees should be wearing roller skates because they are so busy.  Service was fine and we were very impressed by the way everyone working there hustled and got the job done."
Food was great if you like Chinese cuisine and the place can accommodate a group of people. Parking is a block away. Advance reservation is recommended!
"Salt and pepper Crabs were the best! Also the steamed fish and special beef! A must try! We also had the mixed vegetables that were amazingly fresh.
Will definitely come back to this place."
"Fantastic place clearly popular with locals and tourists alike. The food was amazing, service fantastic and prices very reasonable. Only downside was the 25 minute wait for the table"
Upscale restaurant. There were 8 of us so we had a private room. There was a variety of dishes to chose from & were large portions. We each had different dishes & loved them! I especially loved my Magnolian Beef--the beef was so tender & tasty as compared to the same dish I've had at other Chinese restaurants. Can't wait to go back!
"Our neighbor is native Chinese and when asked where he goes he recommended this place. Went on a slow Monday for lunch. No wait but every table was full. Average service, extensive menu, neat and clean spot. Had the seafood clay pot which was delicious. The special sliced beef with a side of fried rice was superb. Both sauces were very tasty and just right. Excellent price made for wonderful and relaxing lunch."
"I was here last week for a business lunch. Between three of us, we ordered a cup of the hot and sour soup, calamari, chicken with vegetables, chicken and beef satay and the shrimp and pineapple rice. 

The soup was overly spicy and my companion couldn't eat it. The calamari had tons of breading and we pushed it away. The chicken and veggies were good and the rice dish was good. Those two dishes together were tasty. The person that ordered the satay barely touched it as she didn't care for it.

Maybe it was an off day. Service was abrupt. We were seated by the kitchen door - lots of traffic. I didn't pay so I can't comment one way or another on the cost.

There are so many restaurants in San Francisco to try. I won't return to this one anytime soon."
"We came here for dinner, it was very busy so we had to wait about half an hour to be seated.
When finally seated we had to wait for quite a while even to get a menu. The server was very impatient and got our order wrong twice
The good was tasty but the overall experience was not a good one"
"If you are looking for a traditional Chinese experience, you must try this restaurant.
Having a reservation is recommended since some days it might be crowded.
You should try the baked cod, the fried squab and the fried crab."
"Fun presentation of the food
The food is good but expensive 
The service is well done without a single smile..."
"Tiny little ""hole . in the wall"" surprise. Expansive resturant area in basement level, great food and portions. Wait staff were pleasant, attentive and very appreciative of patronage. IF we ever return to this checked off the bucket list town, we will return for more authentic chinese cuisine. Thanks to all the R&G employees"
"Our Uber driver suggested we give this place a try, we are so happy we did! The outside is very unassuming, we walked in and were seated immediately. The management sure knows what its doing to make this a great eating experience. The food was fantastic (ate here for both lunch & dinner), our order came within a reasonable time. Great food, great service, what more can you ask for!"
"Whilst we only ordered a few dishes which were of good quality it is hard to equate that quality to the price tag which for 1 appetiser, 2 mains & 2 drinks was almost $90 for some basic no seafood dishes. If money is not an issue when choosing when to dine then give this place a try."
"Don't believe the online menu; the salt and pepper  live crab and many other specialities are actually market price on the actual menu. Closes at 9 midweek, and I got there too late to order preferred steamed dish, so would love to go back with more time. Staff appeared very rushed as it was near to cloing tim, although they were still letting people in after closing. Did not get to see upstairs  or try a variety of dishes; pea pod greens and garlic were very tasty but overpriced for portion. Possible to spend more than intended. Lychee martini was good."
"On our two day trip to San Francisco, we came here twice, first for lunch, and the next day for dinner. Such good Chinese food! we tried the fried crab, which was fun to eat, (messy) and delicious. Everything we ate was terrific. We'll be back."
"My wife and I visited R&G based on a recommendation by a local friend.  We were not disappointed.  The place was jammed on Saturday night, but we opted for a couple seats at the bar.  Full service dinner so no problem.  Super fast paced and loud...but a lot of fun.  We had the Salt and Pepper Crab and some fried rice.  Over the top good.  The waitress kept us plied with our favorite drinks.  A great experience.  A gem in Chinatown."
"This place came highly recommended by a food critic, and it certainly lived up to expectations!

We started the meal with various soups, with the Hot and Sour soup and the shredded chicken and sweetcorn soup being the best ones tried.

This was then followed by an innovative version of duck with pancakes, namely peking duck served with bao buns, which were incredibly soft and light. 

We then got the specialty of the house, a whole peppered crab, which was out of this world and we would recommend getting this dish if visiting the restaurant."
"Our Hotel Concierge recommended this restaurant...great choice.  The only down was we had a reservation and had to wait 20 minutes till our table was ready, however, the food is awesome, the staff superb and this is a 4.5 for sure.  Better table management would get a FIVE ⭐️"
"This restaurant was recommended several years ago, we have now eaten there 4 or 5 times. The food has always been delicious and big enough portions to share. Reading other reviews, I do agree with those who complain about the service and atmosphere. We were there yesterday, on a Sunday. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait, it was over twice that but we decided to wait because we like the food. We ordered right away, egg rooms and lettuce cups. We waited for a long time, finally received the entree. We asked several times about the egg rolls and they finally were served when we were over 1/2 done with our meal. The waiters are so busy, that no one seems to care if you are satisfied or not! But, on the basis of the food, we will still return."
"We were so excited to have dinner at R&G Lounge after so many online recommendations that it was some of the best Chinese food in SF. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. If I was served this food at one of the suburban Chinese restaurants in my hometown of Brisbane I would be underwhelmed, to be served it at an expensive well known restaurant in SF was offensive. The signature crab was bland and not great quality crab, the chicken and broccoli was like something from a food court - cubes of flavourless chicken - and the seafood fried rice was laughable: pale, frozen seafood and literally no taste. I'm writing this in the hope that other people steer clear and spend their money somewhere better. This was a rip off."
"Lots of locals from Chinatown in a Chinese is always a positive. Food was authentic, and ambience was very nice - families, couples, business people - a real mixture. Service was a little erratic, otherwise it would have been a 5. Wine was very slow to arrive, and they had to be reminded to bring the boiled rice."
I guess they don't want more business. You ask for prices and trying to order trays of food but they will shout at you with their prices and if you ask another question they will again shout at you like you're dumb  even though you are just double checking and making sure the order you're placing is correct. So instead of wasting my time I told her that if she doesn't want to talk to me properly I need to order from her and hang up.
"I understand why there always seems to be a line outside of this restaurant on weekends as the food was very good.  I had the stuffed eggplant with bean curd and pork with side of rice which was very good (peppers were spicy, eggplant was tender, etc).  The portion size was more than ample for one person and could be shared by 2 depending on your appetite."
"The Kung Pao Chicken was very good, and as spicy as I hoped.  The service, however, was weirdly slow when there was no need.  I waited 10 minutes between the drop off of my check and a different waiter picking it up to run my card - but my food came out in near record time.  I would return."
"Recommended by our tour guide and has very reviews.

They have a special lunch menu. Started with Vegetable Egg Rolls  Fried egg rolls filled with shredded vegetables and served with sweet & sour sauce, pretty good.

I ordered the Cantonese BBQ Luncheon Plate that you choose from a list of meats, I selected the Cantonese BBQ Pork and Cantonese Roasted Duck. Come with white rice but for $1.99 you can substitute a noodle soup. The soup was bland. Both the pork and duck were just fair.

My wife ordered the Dice chicken with garlic honey, also just ok.

I expected more from the largest Chinatown in America."
Me and my family ate here on Sunday. The fried rice and Peking duck were amazing. The service is quickly.
Outstanding Chinese food and environment.  Service was excellent and accommodating.  Great experience.
"Even though many in our group said that the food here is good, I felt that they are overrated.  Most of the food are very salty.  Fried Dungeness crab is one of them.  Fried rice is tasteless though."
"We attended this restaurant on 3rd July having been recommended it. We hadn't made a reservation and had to wait for an hour for a table for 4. No problem there, we took a place at the bar inside and had a drink whilst we waited. When shown to our table I immediately felt a cold draught from the air conditioning. Our table  was directly by the front window. I don't usually feel cold but I knew that my wife would, so after a couple of minutes I asked the manager if the air conditioning could be turned up. He said this wasnt possible as it was a set temperature for the whole restaurant. I queried that it was only cold by the window and asked if we could change tables as one further inside the restaurant had become available. Ultimately we decided to stay where we were. When it came to ordering our food, the manager became very intrusive and made recommendations to us, speaking  to us as if we had never been to a Chinese restaurant before. We ordered a half Peking duck for 3 to share and my wife ordered a separate starter. My wife's starter came out after half an hour. Our pancakes and condiments came out soon after but it wasnt for another 3/4 hrs before our duck came out. I'm a patient man and fully appreciated that the restaurant was busy but what really cheesed me off was that other diners who'd been seated us had their food brought to them before us. I pointed this out to the staff but it just fell on deaf ears. When our duck arrived I couldn't believe what I saw. It must have been the fattiest duck with minimal meat on offer. Having been sat by this time for an hour and a half, notwithstanding the hour or so waiting time, I was becoming most disappointed. It took another age for our main courses to come out and when they did they came out in drips and drabs which meant our food got cold whilst waiting for the other dishes to come out. I have also got to say the food was so disappointing as well. We have eaten at many top Chinese restaurants down the years and this was the worst by a long way. Having been so intrusive with his recommendations it was disappointing not to see the manager again. We settled our bill for food and drinks but I refused to give a tip (which they had the cheek to ask for!!). This was our first time in San Francisco and our first time in China Town and this whole experience left an extremely bitter taste in our mouths. Go to this restaurant at your peril."
"This restaurant is extremely popular, and one can expect the reception desk  and servers to be somewhat chaotic, but once you're seated and select your dishes from its extensive menu, the food is delicious.  We have been to this restaurant approximately five times, and with each dining experience, we've been pleased with the food.  Making reservations is a must. The prices are higher than most other Chinatown restaurants."
"Our Uber driver suggested R&G  Lounge. He did not mislead us. Great Authentic meals, great flavor and plenty of each plate ordered"
"We booked for 8.30pm on a Sunday night. The place was heaving with people who had booked and walk-ins, and we had to wait 25 minutes for our table.

Service was prompt - the restaurant closed at 10pm. The rice and noodle dishes are huge - a single dish is the equivalent of 3 normal portions. Our waiter kindly told us to stop ordering when he thought we may over order. Food excellent."
The food is very good. Wn The menu also has includes seafood and other authentic dishes. We had the Dungeness Crab.  Very well prepared. Big enough for 2 to share. But be prepared to wait for the seating.  It is very popular amongst the residents of Chinatown.
"Right next to the Dragon Gate inside of China Town. Quite touristy restaurant I would say, however lots of Chinese people having dinner there and quite good food, as well as service. The price is higher than I would expect (comparing it to China Town in NY) hence the lower rating, however clean, good service and good food."
"Found this place online and it did not disappoint.  We booked over the phone but could also have turned up and waited in line.

Very popular and busy which is always a good sign.  Our meal took about an hour in total but we did not feel rushed and like a lot of chinese restaurants dishes are brought to the table when they are ready and not all together like in the UK.

Stanley was our waiter and a real character.  He was excellent as were all the staff and they work really hard.  He advised us on how much to order and we are glad that we went with his suggestions otherwise we would have ordered far too much!  Amazing food and great atmosphere - would highly recommend."
"Having past by R & G for years, it was my pleasure to have lunch there last weekend.
The service was excellent with lots of attention paid to the needs of individual dinners, handicapped, very young and very old and in between.  I did not realized I had dropped my sun glasses until they were produced at the table for identification.  The Crab was tasty, the Seafood and Tofu soup was so good that my Italian Dad had two servings; the baked Cod melted in your mouth; and the honey spare ribs were bit sized and the best I have had."
The food on offer here is the real deal. This is Asian food at its splendidly tasting best. It’s fast and furious and wonderful. Don’t leave San Francisco without sampling it. And their own beer is great too. You’re in for a tastebud treat.
"My friends and I were concerned about this good food restaurant when there was a management change. But after trying this restaurant a couple of times recently, we have found that the good food remained but the service actually got a lot better.  It appears now, all diners get a fair waiting time instead of frequent ""VIP cuts in line"" like before. The waiting staff is also a lot more friendly and helpful compared to before.  This is very good news to diners as now they not only will get good Chinese food here but also get good, friendly service..."
My husband & I visited for lunch following a recommendation from a chinese friend we were staying with.  We weren't disappointed.  The portions are plentiful and service was spot on (ever though we were 1 of very few westerners in the restaurant)  it appears to get busy very quickly (we seemed to time if right but there was quite a queue as we left) and the chinese tea is a lovely touch
Went to this super busy Asian food mecka. Long line but it goes really fast. All portions are quiet big so don’t order to much. Very good.
"This restaurant was recommended to us, so we thought we’d give it a try. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The wait was worth it. The atmosphere was super and food was so tasty. We had noodles, rice and 3 main dishes. There was enough for 2 adults and 2 older teen kids. The bill came to $105.00 including 3 soft drinks and a beer."
We arrived at the restaurant at around 7.10pm and put our name down for a table which we were told would be ready in 20 minutes.  After 20 mins we came back and within a couple of minutes were seated.  The food was excellent - the best Chinese meal we’d ever eaten.  The staff are efficient.  Everyone seated around us looked to be enjoying their meal.  This was my third visit to R&G Lounge and each visit has been excellent.
"This restaurant was recommended to me at my Wellness Wins (formerly Weight Watchers) workshop when I was traveling in San Francisco.  The restaurant has open, shared table seating and is great if you are traveling alone.  The food is clean and basic Chinese fare well prepared.  Business men eat here.  I met another woman visiting the city for the day and got a great tip about free tours."
"This place came highly recommended by our hotel staff.  Only walkins this night.  We waited about half hour for table, not bad.  From there things went downhill.  Placed our order with an appetizer.  Then waited.  One of our dinners was served and we questioned where our appetizer was.  The waitress gave us a blank look and took the plate away.  Our appetizer was served & was very good.  Then our waitress served the one dinner again, same plate, cold by now.  We had to ask where our rice was and still no second dinner.  At this point we asked to talk to the manager.  We explained our frustration and he just kept nodding his head.  While talking to the manager, the second dinner was served but it was the wrong dish!  At this point we just wanted to eat and get out of there.  Our whole meal experience was ruined.  Our dinners were average in taste.  The manager did give us one dinner and the steamed rice for free but our original waitress disappeared and never showed up again.  Needless to say, if I am ever in SF again would not return or recommend this place."
The food was nothing special. Not worth the money. Half of crispy chicken with no sides was $19.00. even the drinks were warm.
"This is always a favorite restaurant to go to.  It is on the edge of Chinatown, so you can find parking close by.  It is better to make a reservation, as the walk in wait is long.  The food is great!  Their salted crab is one of their signature dishes and it is so good.  There are alot good dishes here, and you won't go wrong with anything that you order."
"Good food but very loud.  Some of the waitstaff speaks very little English, they also have a Chinese menu which is not offered to non Asians."
Good food in a classic Chinese restaurant. Lots of Chinese people eating there which was immediately a good sign when we arrived. Peking duck superb and Calamari delicious. My son had the lemon chicken with boiled rice and said the best ever. Simple surroundings but a good vibe to the restaurant. Very popular as we booked in the morning of the same day and the latest booking we could get was 5pm so book early.
"So everyone said get the Peking Duck and the Salt & Pepper Crab at this old school Chinese restaurant, and so we did.  And we were really happy we did.  Especially the crab was delectable, although a tad greasy.  Make sure to include a side vegetable unless you are protein loading, as there is nothing else served with them.
And were they good?  Very!  
Service is very fast, so don't order your food until you're ready to eat it.
Since there were only two of us we couldn't order anything else....next time we're bringing friends."
"Bottom line, food and service fair at best. Food - the crab everyone raves about on trip advisor is the signature dish. It’s extremely cute when it comes to your table. However, it just a deep fried crab that you have to eat just like any other crab. It’s extremely oily and would prefer it the way most cook it. Everything else we had was just OK...nothing really blew me away. Service - extremely crowded and busy restaurant. Our table was constantly left with a ton of dirty dishes, empty glasses, etc. For water, we were served an ice bucket and large plastic bottle so we could serve ourselves....never seen this before!! There was food and chunks floating in the ice bucket by the time we were done...gross!  All in all, a disappointment. I think the people that like this place have been going here a very long time and don’t realize it isn’t very good."
"We had the special beef- amazing, the hot and sour soup- also amazing, the Peking duck- 10/10, and the salt and pepper crab which was just outstanding. The salt and pepper dungeoness crab was the best crab I’ve ever had. The batter was a perfect mix of oily and salty with a touch of sweet. We ordered this for delivery and it arrived quickly and everything was hot and delicious. If you can only eat at one place in San Fransisco, you should eat here!"
"Hotel staff recommended the restaurant.  It is in China town and easy to get to. The food was extremely good.  I had the seafood hotpot, the broth was delicious and the meal was filling."
"We were so excited to try Asian food in San Francisco, and we were sadly disappointed. Quite honestly, Chinese take-out would’ve been better. The only dish that we actually liked were the spareribs, which were identical to what you get at take-out. The spring roles were ok, the salt and pepper calamari had no sauce for dipping and was completely absent of pepper. The corned beef and turnip soup was horrid. The beef was so tough that you would’ve needed a knife to cut through it, but we weren’t given one. The flavor was off as well. The best part of this flavorless meal was the white rice mixed with the hot sauce. Needless to say, we won’t be returning."
"There are 2 exceptionally great dishes in this restaurant R&G Lounge.
1. Peking Duck
2. Crabs
Just order these 2 items and you're set to try other stuffs in the menu or get to try other places in the city.  There are too many good food destinations.  You're in SF!!!"
"We ate here several years ago and promised ourselves to revisit if we were ever in San Francisco again. Well, recently we passed thru town w 6 other friends  overnight on a cycling trip to Napa.. I promised everyone that the salt and pepper crab would blow them away and R&G was everything we remembered. Fortunately this visit w 8 people we were able to order many different appetizers and entrees at the suggestion of Stanley our on point waiter. Everything was spot on. Specifically we had Asian oysters tempura! Excellent! As well as Peking duck! The standout of course was 3 Dungeness crabs which silenced the table w their deliciousness! .. This meal ranked up there in my all time top 5 in flavor and freshness.. and EVERYONE ELSE AGREED.. just go.. and DON’T  MISS THE SALT AND PEPPER CRAB!"
I had the lychee martini and it was Soo good 😋. I also had the short rib soup that was very good. My mother had the chicken soup and the seafood lettuce wraps that were so good! Everything was good and it was quick!
"There were more fish items on the menu than we expected as it was in China Town and we expected more Chinese food.  It was very busy, service was good and reasonable."
"We were recommend R&G by a Chinese friend who lives in San Fran. We loved the food so much, we will definitely be back next time we're in San Francisco!

I've been to many, many Cantonese restaurants and this is the food I was raised on. The food is definitely one of best I've had. Highlights for us included the black cod (best black cod we've ever had), the garlic crab and aubergine dish. The service was good as well (something  I don't expect in Chinese restaurants so this was a real bonus). 

The place does get busy so I'd recommended booking a table in advance. A gem of a place. Great food. I liked the busy ambience and it reminded me a lot of my childhood. 

Would heartily recommend!"
This is a very good ! Chinese (Cantonese) restaurant. Well done food. The dishes are pretty big to share so if you come in a party it is nice to share several dishes as we did. The service and s accurate and the food comes fast. Exactly the kind of place we hoped to find. Avarage prices
"Native San Franciscan here, who has eaten a lot of Chinese food.  This is about as good as it gets.  It’s not cheap, but worth the price. Get one of the crab dishes!  I also liked the my-shu vegetables, and even the Hong Kong style chow mein was exceptional!  Full bar. Generous portions. I’d go back in a heartbeat!"
"Following in Anthony Bourdain's footsteps we went to this restaurant and tried their signature dish, the live crab with salt and pepper - it was delicious and I never had so much crab meat elsewhere. We also tried another signature dish, the R & G special beef, which was also super. We ate downstairs, cosy atmosphere, would definitely go back again."
"We had the Mongolian beef and the chicken with broccoli - both spicy options
The dishe were both large in size and beautiful in taste.
Boiled rice portions not as big but OK.
Restaurant and toilets were clean. 
Would definitely recommend"
"This place was packed and buzzing! The service was a little slow, but totally understandable considering how packed it was. The server recommended a few dishes. We had the Peking duck, westlake soup, and bbq pork. All of which were amazing, especially the duck! This is definitely a place we'll return to every visit to SF. Be patient and you'll be rewarded. I suggest going with a group and trying a lot of dishes, because there was so much on the menu we wanted to try but were only two people."
"Our Uber driver recommended this place when we were en-route to China Town.  We were heading to another restaurant but he said if we wanted traditional Chinese then this would suit us. 

We were so pleased he suggested it. 

The first night was a Saturday night and we arrived at about eight o'clock and It was busy so we had to wait for approx forty five minutes.  However it was well worth the wait. 

We shared two appetisers between the three of us and the hot and sour soup and chicken and beef satay was fabulous. 

For main we had the chicken chow mein, walnut and honey chicken and the Mongolian beef. All of which were delicious. The beef was the highlight and was so delicious. 

The service was great and our server Edward was brilliant and very attentive. 

Overall a great experience. So much so that we went back again  two nights later! It was busy again but we got seated straight away and again the food and service was spot on. 

If you are looking for great Chinese food at good prices with a nice atmosphere then try the R and G Lounge."
On our arrival in San Francisco we decided to go for a Chinese and stumbled on the r&g lounge. Couldn’t fault the service but we did sit upstairs and were quite near the entrance downstairs so was cold. The service was good and the food reasonable but it got cold very very quickly. Portions were massive but I’d rather smaller and hotter for a more enjoyable meal
Came across this one when wandering around and enjoyed one of the best meals of our stay in SF. Might appear expensive but it’s quality and quantity on the plate and very good value compared with others. Service and surroundings could be improved but if it’s good tasty food you’re looking for then this is a place to go.
"This is my usual stop for Cantonese food in SF. It is a couple of blocks from Union Square, and you need a reservation for dinner or come two hours before or after peak meal times. This time we had the soup of the day, xo chicken, fried pork with salted fish, fried ee fu noodles. Good service and excellent meal."
"Came here for the crab, of course! 
Came here late one night with a couple of friends and we were seated right away - without a reservation! Wow!
The place was still crowded though.
Service was great, crab was great. Just keep in mind, it's about $60.
I even got some lychee in ginger ale (I was craving something sweet)."
"We love Chinese food and as not any good places where we live wanted to eat in Chinatown each day we were in SF. Went here for lunch as recommended by our hotel concierge - not disappointed. Had the Mongolian beef and hubby had the chicken with cashew nuts - both were excellent. Place was crowded but we didn't have to wait. Service was ok, prices reasonable."
"By looking at the name, you never associate to Chinese cuisine. By looking at the outside, you don't believe that they are so good. But once you entered the restaurant, you feel amazing that so many people are waiting. So reservation is highly recommended unless you want to spend time to wait. This is my top Chinese restaurant on my list. (Out of more than 100 big cities in 23 developed countries I traveled to). Salt and pepper crap is a must, you will see it on 90% of the tables. Say sauce chicken mixed with BBQ Pork and duck also good choice. Chicken broth in clay port very tasty (but make sure you have 4 - 6 people to share. It is a big pot. If you want seafood,good too."
"Went for the signature dish, salt and pepper crab but was put off by the price, $58. My mistake, the next table had it, it was huge and looked fabulous. Our food was excellent but I found the service poor hence only four stars. The guy who took our order was offhand at best and we had to ask three times fir the rice we’d ordered. I left a tiny tip which annoyed them but hey, look after me and I’ll look after you. Nonetheless I recommend it, the food was superb."
"If you want to mix the China Town mood with a some Crab meal, this is the place. Mind to make a reservation, the place is quite packed at lunch time. I’d recommend the crab soup ( enough for 2-4 persons) and the signature fried crab, also enough for 2. Be prepared to wet your fingers! Good apetit!"
"We went to this restaurant for the several suggestions, but we are disappointed . $ 50 for an oily crab, $100 for a geoduck."
"we were starving after our flight into SF and this restaurant was recommended by our hotel.  We arrived around 5PM, and were the second people there.  This is a walk down restaurant, with a small bar on street level.  We saw another table getting Mai Tais and it turns out that is their specialty.  Wow were they good and strong.  We had the Peking duck, shrimp special and fried rice and were thrilled with everything.  By the time we left it was crowded and hopping."
"It’s cold, drizzled evening so we decided to find a Chinese meals from Union Square, SF. After 10 minutes walk we waited for our table at the R & G. It’s my 2nd time but this time we were 4 of us so we can ordered more meals. Crab w salted eggs, crispy chicken, boiled Chicken, Shechuanze beef.  Crab was delicious and moist! Indeed one of the better one I had tasted. While the chickens were fabulous and my son ate almost the entire meals. They said it’s one of the best in town, with more people waited. This place is a great place to stop for local Chinese. We will return for the 3rd if we return to SF!"
"We were aimlessly walking around Chinatown and trying to find highly rated tripad restaurants using the gps, and always ending up walking in the wrong direction.  A resident stopped to ask if she could help find something.  We asked for a recommendation, and we ended up here.  She said it was good food, although some found it pricey, and that just as important, you'd be able to easily navigate the menu.  We found it to be excellent food, not too pricey, with large portions, and you could easily know what you were getting.  The service was excellent.  Lot of locals go here, a good sign.  Would highly recommend."
"We have been visiting this restaurant for the past ten years each time we are in San Francisco.  It is in Chinatown  right off Sacramento.which is not very touristy.  All the food is well prepared, the crabs are extremely fresh (visit their crab tank on the lower level).  We also recommend the Szechuan green beans and Cantonese fried noodles.  It would really be hard to have a bad meal here."
"We had an excellent meal and warm service.  There are so many choices for Chinese food in SF, it is difficult to select the right place. My friends are locals and they me to R and G.  The restaurant was full of locals and tourists.  Even though the dining room was very full, everything that we ordered was delicious and delivered promptly. Our waiter was a gem.  I highly recommend the wok seared crab-  It is such a treat."
Staff was nice. I ordered four dishes & ended up spending $90 .. at least I visited the restaurant. I probably won’t go back. Because in Chinatown San Francisco there’s a bunch of choices everywhere. Their beef dish is probably my favorite.
"By all accounts, from food critics to word-of-mouth, R&G Lounge is one of the top Chinese restaurants in the city. It is located on the edge of Chinatown and the Financial District and you can expect a large office crowd. It serves Cantonese dishes on two levels, basic downstairs where prices are lower and the more pricey formal upstairs. From the simplest dish to the most elaborate, food is consistently very good and not cheap. Customer service here, however, consists of waiters getting your order and bringing in your food. Don't expect a smile, greeting or any expression of welcome. If you are dining downstairs, you will be hurried along if there is a growing number of people waiting. If you want very good food, there is plenty to be found here. If you want good customer service on top of that, there is none here."
The best wok friend hard shell crab in the city.  prompt if not overly fast service.  Food beyond the crab is good - not excellent.  But who needs it - just order more crab.
This is a popular place with some special dishes.  The fried Dungeness crabs were a bit hard to get into and greasy.  The black cod was the best dish.  Sautéed eggplant and other vegetables were also really tasty.  Would visit again.
"What we have here, is failure to communicate.  
I ordered a chicken dish.  My wife ordered scallops with tofu.  I needed to show the server the menu item with Chinese characters, or it was obvious, I would have received something different. I got my dinner and waited for ten minutes before my wife urged me to go ahead and eat. I was almost finished, and asked another server if they had forgotten my wife’s meal.  They replied that it was almost ready.  The tofu had to be steamed. Over twenty minutes after I was served, my wife’s meal appeared.
It would have helped to have this information, because we could have ordered something different.  Or, we could have asked them to bring the meals out together.
Basic restaurant management was not taught. or followed."
"4 hungry people showed up at R&G and we were not disappointed.  Our lunch was delicious, service was very good, and we will return again when in the area.  Looking forward our next trip already!"
"Wow. This is the place to be on Chinese New Year. Very good American spin on Cantonese food. The quality of the food was good and the service was friendly. If you only go once, you must try to deep fried crab (yes, deep fried crab - it’s as delicious and sinful as it sounds). 

Note: the restaurant does not serve dumplings."
"The fried crab is a must have dish. Truly enjoy the dishes. Another dish to try is their special sauce beef. Tender and yummy. However, do expect a 30mins wait for a table."
"Asked a store keeper where to go for some delicious Chinese food and she recommended this place. It was weird to go down into the basement to be seated for lunch. We ordered the barbecue pork appetizer, salt and pepper crab and R&G special beef. Let me say that if you’re starving you should ask if they are changing the oil anytime before you order. That’s because they did that when we ordered and told us it would take between 15-30 minutes for the oil to be ready. That was ridiculous. I wanted to leave but he said we might as well stay. Luckily it only took 15 min. The barbecue pork was well cooked and nicely seasoned. Not too fatty either. The beef dish was a surprise as it looked deceptively simple but was delicious. It was crispy and not chewy. The salt and pepper crab was not the best I’ve had. The breading was not a good thing. I didn’t like that. But it was ok. Overall not a bad meal."
Loved the food in this place. It was very tasty and the portions were generous. There wasn't a lot of warmth from the staff but they were polite and we got our food very quickly.
"The food was ok, but there are many better places , no dim sum, service was ok but not great. I would not recommend this place, it is not a bad place but not to be recommended ."
"I had an informal meal with colleagues here after one of them got a recommendation for this restaurant. It was packed, but we were seated soon after our reservation time. The noise levels were high; there were some raucous tables with Chinese guests having lots of fun. Great atmosphere. The food was good and the prices, although by no means cheap, were tolerable. Recommended."
Finding a good Chinese restaurant while on a trip to San Francisco was one our agenda. Based on the advice of a local we went here and were very well pleased. The food was of high quality and flavor. Many of the patrons looked to be of Chinese descent and that’s always a good sign. I’d eat here again in a heartbeat.
"Great collection of traditional Chinese foods. Peking duck with hot buns, steamed flounder and battered giant crab legs. The fried oyster are a must as are the mustard greens with mushrooms. A truly delectable experience."
This restaurant is VERY busy - tables turn over at an incredible rate and indicative of the fantastic food. It is noisy and cramped and full of atmosphere so not an evening for a quiet romantic dinner but the food is authentic and varied and the Peking duck was the best I’ve ever had!
This is one of the best options in Chinatown for a good meal. We went on a busy Sunday evening. We only had to wait about 15minutes for a table though. We sat at the bar while we waited. Only thing was our mains came out while we were still eating our starters. The whole experience felt like they were rushing to turn tables
"I came here with 4 other travel colleagues on a business trip. The place was recommended by the hotel we were staying in. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table and there were a lot of people doing the same. It was a Friday night so booking is recommended.

The staff were very friendly and once seated our orders were taken quickly and the wait for food was pretty quick. This is a high turnover restaurant, the staff are clearly trying to get you off the table as quickly as possible but that said it didn't feel overly rushed.

The food is good, I wouldn't say exceptional but very tasty. I ordered the prawns with walnuts and house special beef which were very tasty. The baked cod is also delicious, buttery and very tender.

The food its't cheap, we are visiting from the UK where currently the exchange rate is shockingly bad so this was a very expensive meal for what we got but probably less so for someone living in the US.

I would recommend if you want a good quality meal."
"1. Salt and pepper crab is deep fried crab shells and all in a spicy breaded seasoning. Once you crack she’ll, the crab is tasteless and over cooked. Horrible, if you have ever had seafood in your life. Greasy, tasteless, awful. 
2. The basement room smells horrible. It made me instantly question meal quality and cleanliness.
3. Service was marginal. We received the fried crab before our cocktails.
4. We ordered prawns. It was in a horrible smelling orange reddish seasoning that does not taste good. Fairly certain seafood is frozen and then cooked.
5. Dated environment. No flair for the price.
6. Staff not hospitable did not engage us as customers and seemed put off. 

Good luck! if you go."
"We had to wait about 40 min or so on Saturday night since they don't take reservation. (although Yelp says it does.) Had salt & pepper crab, baked black cod, and geoduck (in 3 ways including sashimi). They were all great. Hadn't have this high quality Chinese food for a while. Highly recommended."
"Very good and clean restaurant, good  Pekin Duck, great service and good prices, in Middle of Chinatown, great  option"
"Came special to this restaurant after watching Anthony Bordain visit, and rave about the Salt and Pepper Crab.  Of course we ordered it, as did every other table we saw.  It was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  This is a fried crab.  There was no taste of crab to be found at all.  All that could be tasted was the fried element.  The price is approximately $50 for the crab, which is what I would expect to pay, but for something tasty.  This one was certainly a miss.  All other dishes we saw people eating looked good, but I will  go elsewhere for crab."
Went here to try their famous salt and pepper crab. It was good but for me it's just too much work. The winner of the night was their baked cod. Fabulous!. A must order! We also had the seafood garlic noodles which were very good. I'd definitely come back for the cod!
"This restaurant had been recommended to us by a local bar, we tried to get in the previous evening but the wait for walk up was an hour...
We book booked for the following evening at 20:00 hours table for 4.
We arrived at 19:45 and was told that the table would be ready shortly. 
Here's the problem there is a very haphazard system of walk ups and reservations being administered by the front  desk.
We waited for 45 mins and when we checked we were told that someone had taken our table. Not much of an apology and a promise of a table ""soon"".
We were seated at 20:40 and given menus a waiter can and asked if we wanted to order so we asked if we could get drinks while we waited.
We ordered appertises which came promptly and were ok.
We waited another 30 mins for our mains and when we questioned this we were told that we were being given time I explained that we had been had been in the resturant since 19:45 and had had very little to eat.
The first main came out and 5 mins later the second and third came 5 minutes later the final main came out.
The dishes were very bland admittedly they were basic dishes noodles and rices but they lacked flavour.
A waiter tried to deliver drinks which and been orders for other customers to our table and we saw this happening for food also.
The whole operation is poorly managed.
Finally the plates were taken from our table as one of the final diners was still eating and to our amazement the bill was delivered .
I paid the bill with NO tip ( this is the first time ever that I have done this) I waited to be asked what had caused this but rather than that I saw a quizzical look on one of the waiters faces as he handed this to who I believe to be the floor manager.
I approached her and told her that my experience had been very poor form the beginning and she smiled and said thank you! She wasn't interested in hearing my complaint which means that they are not interested in improving their customers experience.
San Francisco deserves better than this place I'm sure that there are other restaurants who treat their customers with more respect.
My advice would be try any other and avoid this one."
"The portions are large, but they also are a little expensive. We ordered the Mongolian beef, barbecued pork, pineapple rice. Chicken chow mein, and king pau chicken. The only dish that was truly savory was the Mongolian beef. Everything else was very bland. In addition, the restaurant is downstairs, so not good for people with trouble using stairs."
"We had a very satisfying lunch at R&G, an unpretentious place that serves superior Cantonese fare at reasonable prices. They have an especially good selection of rice and noodle dishes, and the party next to us seemed to be having a delicious time demolishing some crabs. Our server was terrific."
"This place offer the best Chinese food, the staff is very kind and they are very fast to serve the food, excellent service and the is phenomenal, succulent and unique, in the heart of china town of San Francisco this is a must when you como over to San Francis! Enjoy"
"We visited this restaurant a couple of years ago and enjoyed the meal so thought we'd revisit. What a mistake. Firstly we made a reservation and despite this, were still waiting more than 30 minutes later. The food was quite westernised and not very authentic. Seems like you have to be selective with your ordering here, like the salt and pepper crab, Peking duck and beans appearing popular amongst neighbouring tables. Probably wouldn't go back."
"Over numerous visits to San Francisco China Town this is by far the best Chinese food we have found. The decor is plain and simple, the service excellent and the food well worth the wait to get a table.  Generous servings and fresh ingredients over a wide-ranging menu."
"The food was excellent, could barely move after we’d finished due the amount we ate! Really friendly staff too. Definitely recommend."
"Really disappointing to walk into a restaurant with no vegetarian options ...
The waiter said he could change some options to veggie ones but when I looked they were fish dishes and I really didn’t know how he could make them vegetarian.
I would avoid if your vegetarian!"
Very quick service and the service was ok. However I found the food to be unsavory. The egg rolls were amazing! However 2 out of the 3 meals were almost inedible (special beef and honey garlic chicken). The kung pao chicken was decent.
It was recommended by the our hotel and we saw people queuing outside in the evenings. We arrived at 5 pm and many tables were already taken. It is definitely one of the most popular restaurants for the locals. We ordered a variety of dishes and each one was simply remarkable. The price is very reasonable. The deco is old and tacky and the toilets need to be cleaned more often.
"Positive: the food was great.
Bad: If you sit downstairs, it's super loud and it's dark wood panelling. No view, so super fancy drinks. The bathroom was not very clean.
Go to this lounge only if you want good food, don't go for a view or fantastic service."
"We booked a table 7.30 , we were down stairs very busy and the noise was terrible you could hardly hear what people were saying.
Staff were friendly but the food awful,, theduck was so greasy 25$ , spare ribs 15$ had hardly any meat.
The main courses were not nice at all
Very stressful experience we just paid the bill and left"
"My mother and I shared an order of the R & G Special Beef, along a bowl of hot and sour soup and an order of steamed rice.  It was plenty of food and it was all excellent!  The service was very good.  We arrived before 5:00 pm and were seated immediately.  Great meal!"
"The food at R&G Lounge is the best!  The R&G Special Beef dish - a beef prepared with a secret sauce - melts in your mouth.  The Kung Pao Chicken was prepared to perfection.  My husband and I could barely stop eating - it was just sooooo delicious.  The service was excellent; our young waiter Nick was very attentive and helpful in recommending certain dishes.  He nailed it with the beef dish!!  The food is a little expensive, but after finishing every scrap on the table, I cannot complain.  On our next trip to Chinatown, we will definitely be eating here again!"
"Waited 1hr for a table but we thought the wait would be worth it. Food was ok but the service was awful. We were given the bill before we’d even had our main course served, plus  our rice dish and water were missed off, zero apology from anyone !!
My conclusion: very busy and popular but this clearly makes them complacent. A smile and good manners cost nothing, especially if you make a mistake."
Excellent food and friendly service in this Cantonese style restaurant.   This is a very busy restaurant but the service was fast and the food was good.    Reservations required.
"They have some hard to get seafood items like abalone, that was good. I was unimpressed with their famous, and expensive crab dish."
"My long time buddy and local San Francisco resident had one chance to take this east coast visitor out to lunch with his favorite restaurant in Chinatown. We already had plans for an Italian dinner later that night with our families. R&G's black bean sauced dungeness crab dish, along with a plate of stir fry pea pod stems with garlic, and some white rice was the perfect lunch for flavor deliciousness without getting too full as we were having dinner just a few hours later.

I think most people order the favorite salt and pepper crabs, ( a matter of taste ) but do consider the black bean sauce. It is super flavorful, meaty, and finger licking good.

Ask for more napkins, maybe have a beer and you'll be in heaven. The live crabs dishes at the R&G are a unique dish to try for locals and tourists alike. There are also so many other good dishes that were offered on the menu, but we were only two for lunch, and we went straight for the black bean dungies. No other choices would do. Check it out for yourselves."
"The restaurant you should not miss if you look for the authentic Chinese food. Not cheap, but worthwhile! Perfect first dinner for our family trip in San Francisco"
"We visit R&G at least several times a year, since the change of the management, the owner still the same, this is my first visit. Unfortunately, I just can not find anything good about my experience.
Very bad service, the staff seems very unfriendly and unhappy, very slow to bring out the dishes and we had our appetizer at the end! Food quality down a bit and yet the price still at the premium. 
Hopefully, these will change in the next few months or R & G will only exist in the history book."
"Long wait, despite booking a table.  When we were sat down and settled, the waiters then asked to shuffle to one side so they could squeeze another table next to us!  After ordering the dishes recommended by the English / Cantonese speaking waiter, we were later told that 2 of the dishes were unavailable.  When we asked for all the main dishes to be served together, and not staggered, as mentioned by the waiter,  he argued back and was awkward.  Food was ok but the service is truly rotten."
"Dropped in on a recommendation from our hotel & was quite satisfied!  Dined downstairs with the lunch crowd. Our service was very good. The food was awesome too! We had hot & sour soup, & Kung Pao Prawns. Serving size was plentiful for lunch portions."
"We were told that this was one of the best places to eat in China Town.  We were impressed when we first got there.  The food that we received was good, but they completely forgot our son's order.  After stopping several people, they never brought his food out.  We were finished eating when they told us that his meal was cooking.  They never brought food out as a table, but as it was done."
"I go here once a month and the food is consistently amazing. The Mongolian beef and the honey walnut shrimp are my favorites. There is a long wait usually so don’t go during rush hour. Their cocktails are also very good, try the lychee martini !"
"This place was recommended to me by locals and it was SO good. I would have given it 5 stars if the waiting in line situation wasn’t so annoying. Go put your name down and walk around Chinatown. The restaurant is huge and it’s always crowded, which should tell you how yummy it is. Definitely a must-try when in SF."
"We dined at this restaurant twice. The food, which is of Cantonese style, is very good. That is why it is always fully seated. The price is quite high, but there are some reasonably priced dishes. The only thing I remember that is super expensive is crab.

One day this July, I called them before arriving at the restaurant in the afternoon, and they said I could just come and they are open. About 15 minutes later, when we arrived, they had closed and refused to serve us. We had to wait for another 2 hours before they opened again. That is why I am not giving them more than 3 points."
"We went here because we heard anthony bourdain reviewed it with great reviews.  I'm guessing Anthony was treated a whole lot better than the average tourist cause wait staff not friendly.  That's ok cause the food was really good and my mandarin sucks anyways. 
I will definitely go back when in town."
"That’s right! I said it and I’m Asian. Go there before the lunch or dinner rush if you don’t like lines. Otherwise, it is worth waiting on line. Order their specialty: salt & pepper crab, but just don’t look at the price. You won’t regret it coz it’s so worth it! The spices/batter mix they use is legit addicting and no morsel was left behind on that plate. I would fly from the East Coast just for this crab. That’s how awesome it is. 

Also another fine dish of theirs is the Peking Duck. It’s just how you imagine as it should be: soft n savory meat topped w/ crunchy skin you place inside a fluffy bun, which you sprinkle some spring onion n healthy dollop of plum sauce.

No doubt, I will be dreaming of these dishes until I go out west again."
"The food is quite good, but the place itself is kinda a dive. The bathrooms are not great and it is generally somewhat run down. Food is still good. Other places I would go down here first."
"The tour guide on our bus mentioned this was his go to place in Chinatown so we opted to try it.  It was a tad disconcerting at first, we walked in and hostess loosely pointed in a direction for us, so we wandered in and picked our table.  It took a few to get noticed, but once we were the remaining service was great.  We had the sweet and sour soup, delicious! The R&G beef special, yummy, the veggie rolls, crisp and light, and the salt and pepper fried scallops, awesome just very lightly breaded.  Ordered a drink each and had a wonderful filling lunch."
My GF and I went here as part of our visit to Chinatown. I really can't understand why this restaurant gets great reviews. Both are entrees and appetizers weren't anything special. The service was excellent and the ambiance was loud and the room where we dined was crowded.
"Stopped in during our visit to Chinatown.  Saw many reviews and sampled a few items: spring rolls, chicken & beef satay skewers, chicken w/ cashews, garlic noodles w/ chicken.  Overall had a good meal, but didn’t find anything we had to be exceptional.  Maybe we just didn’t order the right items."
"We were pointed out this restaurant when on an open top tour and we decided to give it a go. It did not disappoint. We went for dinner and the restaurant was completely hopping. It was packed and extremely busy. What struck me about that was how, even though it was so busy, the service was still impeccable. They were extremely efficient and really friendly. The food was amazing. Really fresh and totally authentic. I would recommend this restaurant again."
"Looking for the restaurant, followed 3 oriental guys from my hotel to this nearby location— it’s always good to find “native” eaters in ethnic restaurants!  

Several people milling around, I worried about the length of the wait at prime lunch hour. As soon as the hostess got to me, she directed me downstairs where several tables were set up to serve single diners at a common table. 

The lunch menu was varied and everyone at my table was eating a selection with entree, rice and a veggie. Prices ranged from $10 to $13 for a combo. My selections were served cold (rice was hot) which helps explain why the service was so quick. 

Intended to return the following day, but plans changed and there are so many many places to eat in SF!"
"Very good Chinese seafoods restaurant but don't get me wrong, their beef brisket in clear soup booth was a killer too.  Waiter was super friendly."
"I now know why this local has such a great following. It is a local favorite, despite the crowd & long wait to get in. I assure you that the food you will indulge in is worth the wait. Their signature dish is a must have for those who love crab. It is called salt & pepper crab (not listed on the menu) & well loved  by those who return time & again for this dish. The crab meat is tender & in its shell it is deep fried in a simple, well seasoned batter. No gimmicks, just simple perfectly cooked crab. The platter is generous & I recommend sharing this dish. My guest ordered the Mu Shu pork, which of course was better than I have ever enjoyed. The menu is extensive & well worth a return. The staff is busy & not overly pleasant. Despite that I would recommend this restaurant for a true taste of San Francisco."
"We’ve heard so much about R&G Lounge before we went there and I have to say their signature crab dish was a little disappointing. 

The service was good and the waiter was very attentive but the lady at the reception desk was not as friendly as I would have expected. 

We ordered their signature crab dish, with another fish dish and a 3rd one. Both the fish and the other dish were good and tasty but the crab was a little disappointing, perhaps because we went there with high expectations. The crab had a think layer of crispy coating but it lacked the taste this did not help much with exposing the flavor of the crab meat inside. 

Overall I’d say this restaurant is a good Cantonese restaurant but probably not worth going out of your way to dine there."
"To a common normal family, it was quite expensive. The restaurant was located in the basement. Parking was not easy to find.  We parked at meters, then walked over. Dishes we tried were ok. Services were average."
"I must say I am pretty impressed with the authentic chinese food here given that I had many elsewhere and is always disappointment. The double boiled chicken soup and soup of the day is da bomb. Those intense flavors right there and taste of home. USD2.50 for awesome soup right there.

This place is known for their salt and pepper deep fried crab. It is pretty unique and tasty but you get sick of it after awhile because of the batter. It seems like every other table is ordering it. USD52 a pop for a huge crab freshness. The crab is really tasty just that it being fried you dont get to enjoy much of the seasoning after you peel off the shell. Personally prefer the moist gravy style for my crabs."
We got there just before the dinner rush and got a table downstairs. The service is very good - always came to check on us and our meal was served quickly. Delicious. Be careful when ordering if you have any allergies- ask upfront!
"You need to go early otherwise there is a line out the door.  The ambiance is nothing special.  But the food was fabulous.  We had the special beef, the lamb in XO sauce, the shrimp and chicken chow mein.  Sizzling hot, juicy and fresh, and plenty for 3 people.  And a courtesy pot of tea.  Would definitely recommend to others and would go back ourselves."
"I've ate in many, many Chinese restaurants - and often disappointed and rarely surprise but what a find this place was.  Yeah it's packed and we had to book - or wait - and the tables/room are just a typical Chinese restaurant - but what have they done with the food?

Everyone says try the crab but at $50+ for a crab I can get at home for $5 (North Sea) I'll pass (and crab is best served steamed) so we went for the best char sui pork (the kids fave) in which 4 sets of chop sticks attacked it.   The special beef is incredible - super taste, very tender and not like any Chinese beef I've had before.   Good plate of steamed greens,  and excellent seafood/tofu hotpot - the only disappointed was the salt and pepper prawns, were a bit flat.

What a great restaurant and to experience some new flavors at this quality is always a treat."
"This restaurant serves delicious food in a somewhat trendy setting. House specialties are wonderful- we were only two people which is a huge problem for Chinese food where you want to try lots of dishes. Nevertheless the honey spare ribs were outstanding, and all around us the whole crab salt and pepper looked amazing. A must try restaurant!"
"Read the reviews and decided to order carry out to avoid the ridiculous crowd and wait! I ordered the salt and pepper crab and my husband ordered the beef and we also ordered shrimp fried rice. Overall, for $95, it wasn’t that great! The crab was breaded which doesnt make sense to me because it’s still shelled and you still have to break it open to get the meat! Too much work to eat! Again, we were both disappointed with all of it!"
"We wanted seafood and got their Dungeness crab, lobster and clam dish.  The food is was authentic and would def recommend."
"Everyone we spoke to recommended this place to eat - from the taxi driver to the concierge, so R & G Lounge made it into our 'must do' list. We enjoyed a pleasant stroll around China Town before eating here on Friday lunchtime. We were seated at a small table for 2 by the bar and ordered spicy beef, prawns with ginger and spring onions and special egg fried rice. Our bill came to $70 - pricey for lunch, but portions were huge. However, they do offer a lunchtime special at $10 for a lunch plate - I'd opt for that next time."
"We had a delicious meal, it so so tasty and the best beef special we’ve had. Service fabulous, attentive and great with recommendations."
"Overall, a very good Chinese. Do you have to wait and portions are very large. But overall, very good!"
"The baked Cod was amazing! Recommended by Chinese local as best in SF. We reserved for 2, seated at table for 4, and the service was wonderful as well."
Absolutely loved this place - we were recommended by our hotel and were not disappointed. If you don’t book in advance be prepared to wait. We were given a number and told to be back in 45 minutes which gave us a chance to look around the area. The food was fantastic and there is a really buzzing atmosphere. Would highly recommend.
"We visited this restaurant after jumping off the Big Bus tour. 
We were seated down stairs. The menu had a good selection with seafood featuring highly. 
The food arrived quickly and was tasty."
"After a day of traveling and sightseeing R & G Lounge was a perfect first meal in San Francisco. Vegetable egg rolls, Mongolian beef and chicken fried rice was amazing. Hot tea served with the meal was perfect way to take the edge off the cold day. And lunch prices before 2:30pm are a great deal!"
"This restaurant perhaps has the most delicious and authentic Chinese food in the area, and is certainly crowded always.  Wife and I have been coming here for years for good food, but at times the noise level, especially in the main dining room in the basement, can be excessive and distracting.  Fortunately, one can order some foods from this restaurant through Trycaviar.com, but not all the foods on the menu are available for delivery.
Wife and I came here at 4:45 PM on a Saturday, and already there was a line.  They do not take reservations for two people.  We were seated in the basement (the upstairs dining room does not open until 6 PM).  We ordered our favorites- small appetizers including jelly fish, duck tongue, conches, and a cup of seafood and tofu soup, and a whole Peking duck and a baked black cod dish.  I ordered a martini and wife a glass of wine, both of which took more than 20 minutes to arrive.  All the food came at the same time, more or less.  In essence, the service is uneven and inefficient.  The food, however, was excellent as expected.  Of course, we enjoyed the food but not the noise or the inefficient service.  Next time, we will again use trycaviar.com, or possibly order a take out."
The food here is very good. Authentic chinese food and large portions too. Well liked by locals and tourists. I always eat here when I come on business trip.
Took the advice of our hotel and the battered salt and pepper crab was amazing as was the beef special. mak8ng a booking as the queue was big reflecting the quality of this place
Absolute must stop when in Chinatown! We split the salt and pepper crab with chow mein. I’m not a crab person but this was the best crab I have ever had. Cool restaurant down stairs of the lounge middle of the day we were seated right away. Server was pleasant and we will definitely make another stop next time we are in San Francisco
"We ordered the famous salt and pepper crab and a vegetarian chow mien for the two of us. It was a BIG crab and we only ended up eating half the chow mien. The crab had a heap of tasty batter and was full of meat. 

Although the salt and pepper crab is what they are known for, if you are going as a couple, I would perhaps get the crab with some sort of sauce. One crab is probably too much for 2 people as the saltiness of the crab starts to get to you. 

We went there around 7.30pm and waited for about 20-30minutes for a table. Expect to wait as it is a very busy place. There were alot of chinese people eating there which is always a good indication of a great chinese restaurant."
Four of has stopped in and tried different things. All of it was fantastic. R & G Special Beef was magnificent.
Chinatown.  A great Chinese restaurant one block east of the Main Street through China town.  Good choices. Served quickly but we didn’t have to rush. Clearly a business lunch crowd. Good food
"Be careful in ordering too much, make sure that your table talks it over before you order.  We had a great variety of food and our son had their special beef and it was special.  We bought the D & K Book which recommended it and we were glad to have chosen this great Chinese restaurant there in China Town."
"We ate at R&G before it was discovered. I make it a point to get my crab fix @ R&G every-time I visit the Bay Area. I am happy to report the lightly Cantonese style deep fried crab is still fabulous. It’s a must have dish. This time we ordered way more than required, I was more than willing to polish it off for the family."
"Was playing tourist in SF and came upon this place.  Needed a cold Tsing Tao after high 70 degree heat last Friday.  Turns out, I ate here 3 times in two days.  A couple I met from Oklahoma ate here 4 times in 5 days.  That says it all!  With my beer, I had the fried oysters.  They were huge with a nice panko crust but, the oyster itself was juicy and tasted like the ocean.  Came back that evening for the BBQ Pork app, Roast Duck, and special fried rice/noodle.  Awesome!  Pork thinly sliced, duck crispy with a beautiful sauce, and the special fried rice to die for.  The staff were incredibly friendly and played a part in the overall experience.  Third visit included the spring rolls, black cod with chili oil, and the spectacular fried rice with noodle once again.  The cod was perfect.  Keep up the great culinary and client experience!  I will be back.  Please visit."
"After waiting an hour for a table, my husband and I were super ready to sit down and eat some delicious Chinese food. Sadly, delicious food it was definitely not. We ordered a vegetable egg roll as our appetizer, and the chicken with broccoli and chicken with cashews. The first thing to arrive was NOT our egg roll, which is always a pet peeve of mine. A few minutes later our chicken with broccoli came out, followed a few minutes later by our egg roll. In addition to the chicken with broccoli not being in a bean sauce as described, it was completely disgusting. The chicken was repugnant looking, and it tasted even worse. Much to my frustration, the chicken with cashews was equally grotesque in both appearance and taste. We faked an emergency, had the disgusting food wrapped up and gave it away. Probably one of the worst Chinese restaurants I’ve ever been to."
"The service was good and the food was to die for.  We went around 3pm on a Friday and there was no wait.  We had the the Salmon & Avocado Rolls, Chicken and Diced Ham Soup, Salt Fish and Chicken Fried Rice and last but certainly not least the Salt and Pepper Crab.  We only ordered half of the Salt and Pepper Crab which was $29.00 and plentiful.

All of the food was great! The most impressive dish was the hands down the Salt and Pepper Crab.  It is a finger licking good dish. Shout-out to Anthony Bourdain for putting this restaurant out there."
"By far the BEST chinese food anywhere!  While on vacation in SF our group of 6 went and everyone loved it!  We all shared Roasted Duck, Kung Pao Chicken, R & G special beef, and fried rice.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  It is very busy, but we got seated in 15-20 min. Prices are a little higher, but quick service.  It is a must place to eat! Yum!!!"
"Be prepared to wait and be elbow to elbow with other diners.
Food was very good with lots of choice and service was quick.
Price was high for the amount ordered.
No Jasmine tea just black tea at a high cost."
"R&G is a San Francisco landmark.  Selling delicious Chinese fare to Financial District dwellers for many years.  The room is nothing special.  An upstairs-downstairs affair with industrial strength furnishings.  This is not high-end dining, especially at lunch time.  Expect a crowded, loud and busy room full of locals, tourists and business people.  There is often a wait although we got right in this time.  The service is quick and professional.  The uniformed waiters know their customers have an hour for lunch, so the food came out hot and fast with little ceremony.  And as for the food, my favorite Kung Pau chick was well prepared and had good flavor.  A more than adequate lunch time serving.  My colleagues, more regular visitors than me, also enjoyed their meals.  There is a reason why places like R&G survive so many years in foodie San Francisco...GOOD FOOD.  Try it."
"typical busy crowded chinese restaurant with no decor but great food and service.
every table had a crab pepper salt !
the baked cod is outstanding"
"My wife and I eat at this restaurant following having read reviews on tripadvisor.

We hadn’t booked a table and on our arrival, it was very busy but we were seated within 5 minutes.

We were served complimentary Chinese Tea whilst perusing the menu which was very tasty indeed.

Service was perhaps on the slow side, however that being said the restaurant was extremely busy!!

Food was lovely and the portions were massive!!!"
"Visited as guests of a local resident , amazing food , near had a crab dish anywhere like it , the Bass large and delicate, beef with oysters and scollops outstanding."
"R & G lounge was recommended to us by a local merchant. We were not disappointed. The salt & pepper callimari was outstanding! Didn't need any tarter sauce or lemon, so flavorful."
The food is fresh.  The service is fast.  Ask for things if you don't see them on the menu like a steamed whole rock cod.
I am a self admiitted Chinese food snob. The place was very crowded even on a Monday night with lots of customers from Asian countries which is usually a good sign. The food was very good but as a New Yorker all I can say is it’s no Wo Hop!
"This restaurant is kind of pricey, but the menu was quite varied and the food was delicious. We had vegetarian goose (made with tofu skin and mushrooms), deep-fried oysters, and ""three treasures in black bean sauce"" (eggplant, peppers, and fried tofu, all stuffed with shrimp meat). I've also heard that the salt and pepper crab is excellent."
"Went on a Sunday night early & the place was packed- always a good sign- full of families, several generations dining.  Very pretty place & had traditional Chinese dishes.  We ordered about 6 dishes to share and only 1 disappointed.  Found the food a bit salty but seemed like the dishes with vegetables were the best- the veggies were very fresh, not overcooked.  Stay away from the basic dishes- our chow mein was our least favorite- beef, chicken and shrimp dishes were really good.  The egg rolls were very good as well.  Nice service.  Fun& lively place."
"Asked our hotel for a recommendation and this restaurant certainly did not disappoint!  Greeted warmly and seated immediately in this bustling, nearly filled to capacity, casual restaurant.  Waitstaff could not have been kinder, more attentive and friendly.  Our starter was a very big portion of sliced barbequed pork which was fork tender and yummy.  My main was Kung Pao Chicken and my husband had Chicken with Cashew Nuts.  We both thought our choices were excellent.  Everything is fresh, with wonderful flavor and perfectly timed. Portions are big with great value."
"We had the signature crab, which was delicious.  The squab was also very good.  We also ordered clams with black bean sauce, ong choy, steak cubes with beans and mustard greens with black mushrooms.  All were very good.....the only caveat was that the portions were small."
"We were recommended to try this restaurant by the hotel we stayed in in San Francisco.Do book,because the queue was out the door by 6pm.
We had the Peking Duck and it was delicious!"
"Wonderful authentic Chinese food. Really glad we had a reservation for early Saturday night. We still had to wait about 15 minutes, but it was worth it. By the time we left, I'm sure people were waiting more than an hour.

We had some marvelous roast pork, spare ribs, green beans, sticky rice, crab and chicken chow mein. Every dish was fresh, hot and delicious. We ordered a bit too much, but took left overs home.

This was truly a memorable meal, and we'd come back again."
Nice dinner here on a family trip. We sampled some of the restaurant specialties and enjoyed them. Good service and good experience.
"Personally would not visit again.. purely based on such rushed and bad service.. 
the food did taste good.. pricey but very nice flavours.. would not say it’s the best but still nice."
Had to wait an hour to get in very disorganised and no atmosphere to the place. staff kept giving us the wrong food and when they did get it right they were very rude about it. As we finished our meal the waiter threw the bill at us and we heard waiters finding it funny at there rudeness towards us. We told the manager who was stood next to the owner as we left they didn’t give any apology and just shrugged their shoulders.
"Would have never found this without a friend’s recommendation. Menu is not very welcoming for vegetarians - but staff was great and able to accomadate our needs. Vegetarian egg rolls, spicy eggplant dish and spicy green beans ( both made without the pork)were wonderful."
"Visited tonight. Had to ask 3 times for drinks, when they came they were wrong. Waiter dumped them on the table. Ordered starter & had to ask to order mains. However, very quick to throw the bill on the table. Never asked if the meal was ok or if we wanted anything else. Receptionist wasn't interested either. Food mediocre & expensive. Would NEVER visit again."
"We have been there a couple of times since first learning about the place. We recommend the lunch menu, it is a very good value."
"Luckily we had a large party and made a reservation in advance, because it was packed on a Saturday night! Every dish was good to great so really difficult to name a stand out among them. I just remembered all the ingredients were fresh, their special beef was tender and the tofu and prawn with honey walnut dishes was just right. There is really very little margin to differentiate between mediocre and great Chinese food. For such a busy place at a busy time they were still able to deliver it just right meant something.

We also ordered a plethora of vegetarian dishes for the group. Probably one of the largest vegetarian options I've seen."
"We 3 arrived without reservations, ( our concierge, at the Hilton, told us they didn’t accept reservations) at 815pm, the hostess told us it would be a 20 min wait. Meanwhile Danny Glover walked in and the lobby and restaurant were in a frenzy with staff and customers rushing to him and posing for pictures ( he was very gracious and accommodating to those rude people). 45 min later we were seated in the basement, corner 1/2 table. Waiter threw only 2 menus on the table, we had to ask for another menu, put teapot on table, left, another waiter told us we had 2 min to order as the kitchen was closing and “ you better order all the food you want because the kitchen is closing and you won’t be able to order more so order all of it now”. The restaurant was highly recommended by many people and we found it to be mediocre at best. Based on the service, attitude of staff and quality/taste of the food I wouldn’t return nor recommend it."
"Waited 10min for a table which would be ok but in the meantime, the lady at the reception forgot us and let people that arrived after us go first, we complained and she then let us in first, but still, very unwelcoming. Down at the table it only got worse, waiters and waitresses didn‘t show any interest to make the stay pleasant, were in a constant hurry and didn‘t even look us in the eye. Then one of us got the food and we waited forever for the second dish, we even asked the waitress who then meant (in a hurry as always) that the food comes „step by step“. The food was not so great either, therefore, would not recommend it to anybody..."
"Our tour guide turn designed to this restaurant, so we had lunch there and it was fantastic! We had Mongolian beef which was nice and spicy and seafood garlic noodles amazing!
And the best thing was it’s been the cheapest meal we’ve had since we’ve visited San Francisco.
This is the closest to real Chinese food we had since we’ve visited Hong Kong.
Don’t be lame, go and eat there!"
"We only waited 30 mins for a table and the friendly bartender kept us entertained.  Once seated, service was fast and efficient.
We tried the baked black cod, salmon avocado rolls and a couple of melon soups.
Everything was outstanding from the food to the service!"
"I went to R&G lounge recommended by a local colleague and wasn't disappointed. The restaurant firstly had mostly Chinese clientele, and very friendly staff. We had three main dishes shared between us of which the highlights were the crab and spiced King prawns, washed down with a Tsingtao. Its a very busy place, so we had to wait 20 minutes for a table, so would recommend booking in advance, but worth the wait."
"The woman at the hotel recommended this place.  I've had Chinese food more times than I can count, but this place really stands out.  Every dish was fantastic. Not salty and the meats were good quality. Now, whenever we are at a hotel, we ask someone who works there for a recommendation, since this one worked out so well."
The place is located in china town and they don’t take reservation and the wait is super long but it’s worth the wait!!!!! Must try dish is their signature dish crab. Get the salt and pepper flavor - you’ll see it’s on every table .... the black cod is another must try dish.  It’s super tender and delicious ! We also ordered duck-half portion and a vegie dish and noodle.  All the dishes are delicious and if we have more people we would have order more (we have a party of 4).
"Second time we’ve been here and I must say the restaurant delivers great food in a very very busy restaurant. Service copes and whilst the staff are under pressure to serve, drinks, food and relay tables. 
Food is well presented and plentiful.
This is not a posh place but as it is full of mostly local American Chinese then it must be doing something right,
Not for princesses but it delivers"
"The food was nothing special, but the service was horrible. We were told to wait 10 min to be seated, but it took 35 minutes."
"My company had a dinner for the Americas’ sales team and we not only kept the staff hopping but they delivered a superb dinning experience.

From the very start we had excellent service coupled with a large assortment of tasty dishes.

I can't wait to give this place another try without a hungry hoard of colleagues.

Love the place.

My 2 cents.
Greg T."
"While visiting some local natural food stores, we received a recommendation for carb at R&G Lounge.  We were not disappointed!

The salt and pepper crab was outstanding.  Great size, preparation and taste.  We tried the vegetables and beef as well. 

A great find on the edge of Chinatown and financial district."
"Great place for Chinese seafood. The crab is amazing! We also had really good squid, duck, and beef. Prices are fair for the quality, this is one of the top Chinese meals I've had in the past few years. Nicely priced, thoughtful wine list as well. Highly recommended."
Met a local friend and walked around Chinatown.  R & G was excellent and we will go back.  FYI my wife is Chinese and she liked it a lot.
Great menu with Amazing house specials and fabulous food!Highly reccomend them for great Chinese food at the edge of Chinatown
"Looked around a few places in China Town area and landed at this spot.  This is some of the best Chinese food I have ever eaten.  The price was reasonable and the food was outstanding.  I do not recall all the dishes we had but as close as I can remember it was:
Salt and pepper spare ribs - makes my mouth water just remembering the taste
Spicy Chicken - could have been spicier
A Beef dish - super tasty probably my favoriate after the ribs
A seafood noodle dish - this was very tasty.

One of the really nice things was that the waitstaff would steer you away from dishes that you might not enjoy.  We actually had a beef noodle picked out but when we went to order it they waitress politely said ""you will probably not like that, Chinese people love it, however you might not.""  Now while some may take offense I liked they are willing to inform you of a possible bad choice ahead of time.

The price was great I think we paid $80 for all of that which was a really good deal considering we were stuffed."
"R&G Lounge - what great Chinese food!  We were surprised to find such good Chinese food in the US - while this is not banquet style cooking but rather home cooked Chinese, it is of a high quality.  Stick to the specialties of the restaurant - you can't go wrong.  Inexpensive, but very crowded and noisy with big groups of diners.  Must reserve."
"If you're used to a ""cheap"" Chinese restaurant, you might find the prices a bit high but it's obvious from the ingredients that they care about freshness.  The waiters were extraordinarily friendly and are happy to try to make a special order.   The place is noisy but that's because lots of people are eating here and they're eating here because the food is actually good!
We had the double boiled chicken soup and while $10 for a single bowl is more than I'm used to in a basement Chinatown adjacent setting, it was really worth it.
Kitchen special order made me beef and scrambled eggs with onions.  Fresh, not too exciting but yummy. 
Also ordered a spicy vegetable dish and the eggplants were cooked to perfection.  The egg white and scallion fried rice with dried shrimp and scallops was better than expected.  
All in all, a positive experience..."
"Went here because of the salt and pepper crab. We were able to get right in on a busy Tuesday late afternoon. We ordered 4 dishes, and were pleasantly surprised when the waiter said that was “too much food”. So we dialed it back to the crab, some shrimp dish, and pork fried rice. The crab comes out hot to the touch. It’s good? And in my opinion too much work to get what is really a little amount of meat. The service was great, and even though our fried rice was some type of seafood rice vs pork, it was good and would recommend one try it when visiting SF."
"It has been my best choice for Chinese food in San Francisco. Very authentic cantonese cuisine and cooked to perfection in USA standard . 2 storeys shop house with limited seats if come to peak hours .  Don’t miss to order the Dungeness crab cook in salt and pepper, clam cook in the black b an sauce, fried pigeon .. love it and never gets sick of it. Do make your reservations before you come."
"I was not terribly impressed with the food. Maybe that is more because I do not get to eat true authentic Chinese food very often in Cincinnati, Ohio. There was a giant fish/prawn/lobster tank in the middle of the room where we were seated to eat. I looked into the tank before the meal and probably 90% of the fish were dead and just floating around...not sure if that is normal or up to code?

My two buddies that were with me ordered the Chicken and Broccoli dish and the Kung Pao chicken. I tried both of their meals and they were very good. I ordered the clams...they were decent.

I did enjoy getting served complimentary hot tea within minutes of sitting down. We also were given a massive bowl of white rice that was also complimentary. Maybe if I hadn't looked into the fish tank and ordered a more traditional plate I would have had a different experience."
"Good menu with classics and spread of seafood, meat, poultry and vegetarian dishes.  30 min wait on a week night.  Very satisfied with the quality and size of dishes.  Family of 5 (very familiar with Chinese food) had rice with the dishes.  Thumbs up from the family.  Restaurant does not do dim sum which tells you they specialize in dishes.  They do it well.  Would return."
"We love the R&G lounge!  All four of our meals were delicious! This is our second trip to San Fran and because we loved R&G Lounge the first time s much, it was definitely on our have the go list and we were not disappointed!  So happy we found it again!  Perfect!!"
"Fantastic and delicious food!!! Highly recommended!!! Ordered salt pepped spare ribs, 1/2 roast chicken and special beef. All were authentic Chinese food."
"My 14-year-old son and I dined here one night when we wanted something close to our hotel. R&G was within walking distance and I knew it to be a reliable dining spot, popular with locals and tourists alike. We probably could have ordered better -- I'd had the salt and pepper crab before but we weren't in the mood for it on this visit -- and opted for the Mu Shu Pork (sp?) and special beef instead. The service was prompt but nothing special. We were in and out in a short time. Full."
"We were given this Restaurant by a guy at our Motor Inn so took his advice,wow,if you like Cantonese cuisine then do yourself a favour because this is the very best.We enjoy a good Chinese,Thai or Maylaysian meal but this was very special.
Good service as well and the Barman was so friendly and professional.Absolute must visit when in San Francisco."
"Was able to get a table for two without reservations on a Sunday night.  Quick and attentive service.  Had the fried Dungeness crab and it did not disappoint.  Not cheap, but worth the splurge.  Roast pork and chicken dish were standard."
"We were at excited to eat here after reading some rave write ups on multiple different sites.  Food was ok.  Nothing bad but nothing spectacular.  It was very fast though.  Like many Chinese restaurants, sodas are by the can and not fountain drink.  Hot and sour soup was pretty good.  Salt and pepper calamari was pretty good.  Everything else we got was average.  Unsure why this place was rated so high in so many sites.  To be honest, I left a bit disappointed.  I thought San Francisco Chinatown was going to wow me.  I think we just went to the wrong restaurant.  I can get  average Chinese food like this in Texas."
"This is one of those rare places in San Francisco where you can get high quality Chinese food, good service  and feel like you got a good value.  Visitors are starting to find this place but it's still mostly locals.  For about $20 per person (not including alcohol if that's your thing) you can share several dishes and enjoy a variety of great flavors.  The seafood clay pot is one of their specialties and I highly recommend it.

Easy to find in the heart of Chinatown on Kearny."
"We asked many people at the hotel and taxi drivers about recommending a chinese food restaurant in San Franciso and everyone said R&G Lounge.   So we went, had to wait for 30 minutes for a table but it did not disappoint.  The place was jammed midweek with mostly locals.  The food was so good.  The hardest part is what to choose."
"We keep going back here for the house specialty salt and pepper crab witch is better then any other place we have tried that dish. The portions are large and great for sharing, so you can get several tastes at one meal.   We try different things from the extensive menu to go with the crab and all have been vary good to excellent. the major part of the restaurant in the busy basement.  Some times the service could be better as the waiter are vary busy most of the time and seem to have tunnel vision and do not see anything not in front of them. but the food keep us coming back."
If you are looking for the real deal ... excellent meal. Eating with the locals is always a good choice!
"At the nearby Hilton Financial District for a seminar, I took a walk alone around an area of town I did not frequent when I lived here ending 12 years ago.  Saw many people going in and sat at the bar as they were busy. Never saw the dining room. The Seafood Clay Pot was ample, fresh and hot. That and a Tsingtao and I left full and happy. A little pricey even for SF."
wow we found this place on Kearny street in china town and was a great place.  lots on the menu and every things served and very fresh.. Loved that they served Chinese tea in a  tea pot to the table.  The place is full so go at the off eating times.. but we loved this place
First time eating here.  Food was really good...I recommend the honey garlic chicken and the walnut shrimp.  Just a heads up - you will need to order rice separately as it was not included in either dish.  This place stays busy so you may want to go during an off time.  We went just after the lunch rush at 1:30.
"I saw the review at yelp and it had a great review. I order the prawn with honey walnut for $$20 per plate . It was not enough for 2 people and $20 vegetable which not so great either 
I won’t come here again"
"Traveling with a large party for work, I called R&G at 6 to see if they could seat a party of 7 and they were able to accommodate us very quickly.

The restaurant is downstairs from the main street level and a little cramped - but oh is it worth it.  We ordered a number of dishes and every one of them was amazing.

Scallops Steak and Macadamia nuts
Schezwan Chicken
Shrimp Fried Rice
Ribs
Moo Shu Pork
R&G Special Beef
Spicy Chicken and Brocolli

Also, the Salmon and Avacado spring roll was absolutely delicious.

Highly recommend this place - service was fast and courteous.  The prices range from 18 - 22 per plate with some other items that are more expensive - but everything had amazing flavors."
"So ate here on two occasions, the food is very good, excellent fried rice, terrific deep fried scallops, wonderful black cod special, but my word its busy, people queueing to get in, 30 minute wait or more for people who walk in, service is frantic, with waiters often forgetting what has been ordered, atmosphere reflects this, it isn't a relaxed meal but it is good food and at a reasonable price. Makes sense to make a reservation."
I travel to SF two to three times a years to enjoy the sights and Chinese food. This place is a standard stop for me. It has fresh seafood and an extensive menu.
"We had the bird nest soup, roasted duck, and chicken fried rice. It was all delicious, but the rice was AMAZING! It was busy while we were there, but the service was still very fast."
"This restaurant was recommended by our hotel concierge, for which we are very grateful!  It was only 1.5 blocks from our hotel.  We went for an early dinner and were seated right away.  (The seating area is downstairs.)  We ordered vegetable spring rolls as an appetizer.  The wraps were very crisp and fresh, and the dipping sauce was sweet and tangy.  My husband had wonton soup, which he said was delicious.  His entree was Mongolian beef, which he said is the best he’s ever had!  (That is saying something, as that is what he orders anytime we go out for Chinese!)  I had one of the Chef’s specials:  fried black cod with a spicy Thai aioli.  It was incredible and melted in my mouth!  This is a clean, well-lit basement restaurant with a friendly and attentive staff.  Worth the trip to Chinatown!"
"Couldn't wait to try food in China town, to be honest wished I didn""t bother, the restaurant is very busy, you are crammed in three different areas, the food is very over priced and was bog standard, I was expecting it to be fantastic.
A bit disappointed to ge honest
Wouldn't"" visit again"
"We had the R and G special along with a couple other meals. The food comes out hot and very good. R and G is busy with a quick turnaround, but we didn’t feel rushed."
"R&G will be one of the highlights for us during this trip to San Francisco. We had a great experience here tonight!

The signature crab dish is a must! Deep fried crab in the shell - very greasy, but very tasty! We also loved the fried rice, which wasn't too heavy and very flavorful. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant is electric. R&G is very popular and fills up fast in the evenings. Service was also very good. 

What more can you ask for? Come here!"
"I asked the woman of  a souvenir shop in China Town SF to advise me about a restaurant for my stomach is too sensitive to Hamburgers. So she advised me  R &G lounge. First the reception sent me to the restaurant at the upper floor but that was more for business men, although I was dressed very business-like.  So I went downstairs. 

The ""normal""  restaurant was very normal. The service was quick to very-quick, but not fast-food-like I ordered  a unknown dish, the photo of the food looked  good  and the meat was very good, was tasty and really Chinese flavored.  For Europeans the quantity is good, take some rice and chop sticks."
You can not expect too much from R&G Lounge' ambience given the diner room location in the building's basement. The food however comes tasty and plenty from a very extensive menu and at reasonable prices. The pekin duck could be served in a more friendly way to enjoy it.
"We went here on two people's recommendations (and the fact that Anthony Bourdain paid a visit on his tv show No Reservations).
We went on a weeknight at 7.30pm and got seated downstairs without waiting. Decor is nothing fancy but we were here for the food. Nice sizzling beef dish, stir fried spinach & garlic had a lot of flavour, roasted chicken nice and crunchy. Have had much nicer chicken & sweet corn soups so give that a miss. Restaurant closes at 9.30pm.
I would say nice, safe restaurant to take kids and if looking for a meal in Chinatown then worth a visit but not sure that I would line up or drive half way across town for the food."
love to come here for their delicious food. service is ok. parking garage is next door and parking validation from the restaurant is plus.
"Excellent food, good & friendly service. 
I recommend. I went alone but had a terrific time. Plus it's in SF typical China town. 

Get the duck!!"
"Was highly recommended by friends and colleagues so went to try it out. Maybe we didn’t try the crabs. We had soy chicken, mushrooms and vegetables. Nothing to shout about. Wouldn’t come back again."
Great Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Go early or you will have to wait in line for a while. They don’t take bookings. Cantonese style food is very delicious. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Food came out quick. Highly recommended.
"R&G Lounge has an excellent Signature dish called the ""Salt and Pepper Crab"" which I highly recommend and you must try when in the area.  Service is fast and is a clean and decent restaurant.  Don't forget to try the other items on the menu which are also great including the Hong Kong style noodles, honey spare ribs, wintermelon soup and hot and sour soup.  I visited this restaurant twice while on vacation."
"R & G Lounge located  in 651 Kearny Street, China Town, CA, serves the best crab I have tasted for a very long time. And all the short comings that this place has, is easily overlooked by just enjoying the yummy salt and pepper crab. The R & G lounge can be voted as the best Chinese (Cantonese) restaurant in California. Better than the delicious seafood that is served in Pier 39. My son rang me up and told me not to miss this when we were in San Francisco. 20 minutes walk from the Pickwick Hotel, where we stayed, it turned out to be the perfect ending to our trip. 
Its unassuming exterior, subdued look hides the surprisingly gourmet food it serves. A little bothered by their curt and hurried responses, I was wondering why I bothered to come here. The place is small and crowded. The top  or main level has a small bar, the lower level has a small dining area. It was pretty full. After a 40 minute wait the salt and pepper crab arrived.
It was a huge 2 pound crab...enough for two small eaters. We carried it back to our restaurant and boy oh boy...the crab was simply delectable! I was lost in the creamy, soft , fleshy and simply heavenly crab meat. No fancy dressing no exotic spice, simple salt and pepper crab. Naturally it must have been cooked in some special broth. All my irritation dissolved. We thoroughly enjoyed the crab. Though I must say it was a little expensive 58 $.
I would definitely visit R & G lounge if I visit San Francisco again."
"Was told by local friends to go here so waited 30 minutes at 3pm on Christmas day. once we were seated, we were served with hot tea along with the menus.  We ordered the famous fried dungeness crab along with Peking duck, crispy beef and the salmon spring rolls. the food arrived quickly and was delicious. Good food but not worth the wait"
"Went here with young kids & we were seated in under 5 mins. We went early though, maybe around 5:30. Looked Like a decent amount of ppl lining up when we left. 

Food was good but not amazing. Although my wife liked it more than me. Both Kids liked it too and ate all the dishes. Atmosphere was average downstairs but acceptable. 

We had egg rolls, lettuce cups, chow mein and a pork and crepe dish (pictured). All tasty and nice. 

Service was fine and food came out quick."
"We were in SF a few years ago and visited this restaurant. It was a long wait so we decided not to wait. When our friends learn that we are coming to SF, they recommend us this restaurant. We arrived at 2:30 pm and we still had to wait but not too long. The cod fish was expensive but totally worth it. I never had cod this way. Highly recommended."
"Was visting SF for the first time with the family and was told we've got to try R&G Lounge restaurant. I am so glad we did. Everyone enjoyed the dinner, including the kids. The salt pepper Dungeness crab was awesome. We had the signature honey spare ribs too. And the baked black cod was fresh and simply yummy. The service staff was attentive and polite which made the whole dining experience very very pleasant. Will definitely visit this restaurant again whenever we visit SF!"
"We stayed at the Hilton across the street and always saw a line of people waiting for their table. Now I know why.....the food is excellent, the environment is frantic and it was well worth the wait.  Go for lunch, the wait if not too long and the prices are lower."
"As we walked the whole day in the city, so tired and hungry, we decided to eat our favorite crabs in SAN Francisco in r&g. 

As usual, the crabs did not disappoint us, succulent, fresh, tasty, delicious fried crabs! 
And of course we never miss ordering the barbecued cod. Another must order in r&g! You'll forget your name with these 2 dishes! It's a no miss in every visit!"
"A step down...
The signature CRAB fried style was a disappointly SMALL as it has been my favorite in the past.

Soup got cool before serving...
Other dishes, too.
Was not busy that night."
The salt and pepper crab was delicious as was the soya sauce chicken.  The food is very good with acceptable table service.  We had dinner here but they have special lunch plates that are very reasonable and seem to be the way to go.
"We have been to this restaurent multiple times. , always a reliable place for best Cantonese food in SF . Upstairs for banquet and bigger parties ( all big round tables ), nicer decor .  Doownstair your hole in a wall place , more crowded , tighter space , and a glimpse  of the busy kitchen through the door and the tanks filled with lobsters , crabs and fish   ( not an open kitchen ) . The service has improved through the years , but you just need to be proactive and a bit pushy to get attention .  Two of us has vegetarian duck ( fantastic and tasty ) fried oysters ( big plum Vancouver variants fried to perfection , sweet and sour sauce provided , but ask for Worcestershire  sauce a much better fit  , the waiter actually said not available but came back with it ). Whole Pigeon ( moist , meatie , gently   fried very crispy, we were just in Hong Kong recently at a famous pigeon restaurent , the bird at RG better !  ). The plane  steamed chicken served with ginger and green onion (. Steamed to Cantonese perfection , red near the bone , the chicken is a special breeed , yellow skin , hard bone , definitely not your cage raise variety.  , wonderful ). A veggie and black mushroom dish excellent too.  The dishes started to arrive in 5 minutes after the order and all in within 25 minutes.  The place fulled . The kitchen was very busy , but efficient and a great system.  Many have the salt and pepper crab , a signature dish , unfoutunately , one of us is allergic.  . A place to return and try new dishes  Five Star for food. , a four rating because of the decor"
"Great Seafood with Crabs, Prawns, meats and vegetables cooked the Cantonese way! Place is always crowded serving to orientals and caucasians alike! The Chinese in SF crowd this restaurant for lunch as well as dinner. Its yummy from mid price to high dependent on the content one orders."
"We went to this restaurant because of the reviews.   I ordered a shrimp and snow peas dish.   The waiter informed me that it would be spicy, which I love, but it was lacking in that area.  Shrimp were perfectly cooked but it could have used more heat.   Overall I would say the food was rather bland.   Service was great."
A coworker and I went here for dinner on our last night in San Francisco. It came well-recommended by local Asian friends and the hotel concierge. Our food was mouthwatering. It was perfectly. Staff were friendly and efficient. Definitely a place to return to.
"From multiple sources, i was told that this was the restaurant that you need to go to in Chinatown.  I went the first time around 10 years ago, and was a bit disappointed and thought it might have been over-hyped.  Fast forward 10 years and have someone in the know originally from Hong Kong order and wow, what a difference.  Food was tasty, restaurant very loud with mostly Chinese being overheard, and typical service that you might expect from a Chinese restaurant.  Yes, definitely lives up to the hype."
We were disappointed as we expected more.  The food was average at best. I asked for spicy and the dish was bland.  I wish we would have had an another opportunity to eat elsewhere in Chinatown during our vacation.
"This excellent restaurant was recommended by the ethnic Chinese concierge at our hotel. It is popular, and booking is essential but very worthwhile. Every dish was superb, and our only minor complaint would be that they are so busy that interaction with the very competent and efficient staff is impossible. A great night out."
"Took a big chance after reading past reviews about the popularity of this place and the recommendation to reserve. And so we waited...after 40 (seemed like forever) minutes, we were finally seated. I don’t care what anyone else says, this is the best Chinese meal I’ve had in America or Asia. The Oysters with Ginger & Onion, Eggplant with Garlic & Mushrooms and their specialty dish, Special Beef are all amazingly delicious!!!  Will have to go back and try other items on their extensive menu."
Super freindly staff and great food. Asked one of the locals and they told us to stop by here and get a bite to eat. Very pleased with our visit.
"Everytime we visit San Fran we stop here.  First time we were walking by and it had a line.  We had a drink and waited.  Well worth it.  All the people were right.

All the seafood dishes are wonderful.  We especially like the crab in black bean.  But they offer it 5-6 different ways.  Each one coming out looks phenomenal.  We also like the whole fish, sliced duck, green beans, etc.  Everything coming out looks wonderful.

There are many places in the area but this one is consistently excellent.  We have come for years and always consistent."
"Showed up on a Saturday night approx 7pm. Waited for approximately 1 hour before being led to their downstairs seating area. We ordered 2 entree's and fried rice and soup. First came one of the entree's (I think it was Mongolian beef). It was VERY average mall type chinese food. Close to 10 minutes later came the chicken dish. I can't remember the name of the chicken dish but I found this dish completely inedible. The chicken pieces were very small and did not seem fully cooked through. A few more minutes later and out came the rice and the soup. We left most of the food over.
Bottom line: I would never go back. I can't understand the appeal for this place?"
"We asked for a recommendation on where to find the best Chinese food from a local and he directed us here.  It doesn’t look like much from the outside.  When you walk in you’re directed to the basement to the dining room.   I’ve been here twice and many locals dine here.  This time we were with another couple and we ordered salmon egg rolls, vegetable egg rolls, and spicy prawns for appetizers.  All were wonderful!  The hot & sour soup is a must try too.  We also had minced seafood lettuce wraps, R & G special beef, and steamed rice.  We shared family style which is common there but the portions aren’t ridiculously huge.  It was the perfect amount and we loved every dish.  The service is fast and friendly.  Highly recommend!"
"Oh what a fun experience! Hostess, wait staff, decor all a delight to take in. Food was alright. We tried the chicken chow mein and special beef."
"The food was excellent.  We loved the salmon avocado egg rolls. Our favorite was the beef and scallops with macadamia nuts. It was great.  All the food was very fresh, well made and presented. Service was quick. The staff checked back on us and made sure our drinks were full, but did not seem very friendly. We would definitely eat here again."
"We were seated downstairs where is was hot, stuffy and dark, the service was good but the seating was cramped, I felt claustrophobic. My glass was very dirty, preference was given to larger tables, the food was average"
We fancied Chinese food and having checked Tripadvisor reviews we decided on the R&G Lounge. The food and service was very good and the prices were reasonable. It was very busy and the only downside was that our table was one of three alongside the bar in a corridor area! Despite this would recommend the restaurant and would definitely visit again if ever back in San Francisco.
"We went for our first dinner in San Francisco recommended by hotel staff. We were not disappointed and will definitely return. We were told afterwards they are famous for their Crab so we will go back to try it. 
Satay Sticks were the only disappointment they were a 5/10, the salmon egg rolls were sensational as was the chicken salad."
"It is with mixed emotions to write this recommendation, but the food is amazing, but service is beyond louzy. The food is mind blowing, but the entire attitude of the staff is get you in and get you out, as fast as possible. They will even remove your plate while you are still eating and when you tell them to slow down, they act like it's an insult. The quality of the food though, is amazing."
"We booked earlier in the day. When we arrived the crowds spilled into the pavement. We were led to the table reserved for us with little delay.  We ordered and shared. Food was good  (not great) and service was prompt. But, clearly this was not a place to relax and dine because waiters hovered to clear the table as soon as you finished."
"Okay, its not fancy. But if you are looking for genuine Chinese food, this is the place to go in San Francisco. Not in touristy Chinatown, R&G is located in the Embarcadero/Financial District and a favorite for locals. The place is a bit hectic, but for a good reason: The food is great. Everything is fresh, authentic and imaginative. Prices are more than reasonable. Found it via TripAdvisor and the reviews were spot on. When in SF and looking for Chinese cuisine, this is the place to seek out."
Good food and great service.  Had the pan fried chow mien with the works.  Sauce was delicious and the honey ribs were great as well.  Traditional Chinese food the way I remembered it in China Town 40 years ago!
We stumbled across this place a few years ago and went in to have dinner. Some of the best chinese food i have ever had. We come back every time we are in San Francisco. We visited this year on a Friday and had to wait 40 mins for a table but its still worth it.
"Two levels, decor straight out of the wood panel with fish tank style, service is the no non nonsense Hong Kong variety, book or get there early, favoured by Cantonese regulars with good reason. The  crab is the speciality so don't stray, add the vegetables and the thee treasures. Heaven"
Good food and prompt service. The food is reasonably priced and is highly recommended by the bus tour companies. Enjoy!
"When not sure where to go even after consulting Trip Advisor, ask a local.  Recommendation was R&G and now understand why.  A little off the main drag, the menu was extensive, food delicious, and service friendly.   The vibe had a throw back feel but what was I expecting for authentic US Chinese cuisine.  Late lunch here topped off a nice walk through Chinatown."
"We took our out-of-town relatives to this restaurant for a late lunch avoiding the big waiting. We ordered the signature dishes peppered crab,and  the bake sea bass. We were not disappointed. The service is fine for Chinese restaurant standard, the wait staff  responded quickly if you asked them but they don't proactively check your need. The price is very reasonable and everyone is happy with the food."
"This place is a stand by for me.  The food is very good and reasonable.  All very flavorful and fresh.  However the decor is anything but fresh, looks the same as it did the day they opened, well not as fresh as you might guess.  Still I will return on my next visit to San Fran."
The place was recommended by our hotel. We have really seen better... we were disappointed. Nothing was bad. But nothing was particularly good either. Chow mein was more than flat and tasteless. The special beef ... had nothing special. Well...
"Overall service is just average.  But most of the dishes are delicious eg fry crab, fry cod, fry beef with vegetable.   Came to eat here at least 3 times per trip for all my SF trips.  Make sure u come as early as possible for dinner into order to avoid the long long queue."
"Chose this restaurant based on TripAdvisor; sometimes TA gets it wrong!

Ordered roast duck and ribs with rice.

Duck arrived and it looked great, however when the skin was pulled back there was literally no meat - all bones and fat. Apparently that's the kind of dick they get! Photo shown of duck before and after.

The meat on the ribs was good, however the bones throughout were small sharp cuts. I was pulling short splinters out of my mouth.

Wouldn't return, albeit it was packed full.... they won't miss me!"
This restaurant was recommended to us so we excited for some great Chinese food in San Francisco.  Staff are rude and the food was awful. Served dried up pieces of meat and tasteless duck. Don't bother. Look elsewhere.
"Is place is worth the wait if you have to, or they will serve you at the bar. We went there twice and both times the food was great, the service was very good and the drinks were fantastic. As I said, the service was very good, and there was nothing that was too much trouble for the staff"
Would highly recommend making reservations to avoid wait. Don't be deceived by the name. It's really just a traditional Chinese restaurant where you are packed in and service is brisk. But boy is the food good. Got the geoduck sashimi and then got a broth made with the remnants. It was so good!! Something I don't see in Toronto. Also highly recommended the baked cod. The Dungeness crab is deep fried and I saved the garlic bits to add to my bowl of white rice. Don't go anywhere else for Chinese food. This place is it!
"The food was actually pretty good but the service was disappointing. We were herded in and the waiting system was confusing. When we eventually sat down, the waiter forgot our drinks and our mains arrived in different stages. The internal decor was pretty basic and lacked any sort of atmosphere."
"Recommended by the Triton Hotel front desk, arrived on Sunday night, could tell it was going to be good seeing the amount of people waiting for a table. Accommodated without a reservation after a short wait. Staff were certainly working hard but service was a bit haphazard as a main dish arrived before the appetiser which arrived at same time as rest of main dishes. However this can be forgiven as the quality of the food was excellent. A thoroughly enjoyable and reasonably cheap meal. So good that we went back two nights later with no letdown in quality, did not order appetiser this time. Thoroughly recommend this place."
"Came here based on Tripadvisor's reviews. Decided to get take out instead as the place was packed and heaps of people waiting for a table. Ordered a couple of dishes including stir fry veg, Peking ribs and roast duck. Overall food was tasty however extremely disappointed with the roast duck. I have eaten / cooked / taken out lots of ducks and I know when pieces have been removed from my order! There were no breast meat pieces AT ALL in my order. will not recommend such a dishonest place!"
"Chinese seafood, Cantonese and delicious.  Our group of five were shuffled downstairs into a crowded noisy room which we faced with some trepidation. The decor was haphazard at best.  However, the dishes, particularly the lobster and deep fried crab were moist, fresh from the tank and quite succulent.  Next time we'll try the 'elegant' room upstairs."
"Don't be put off by the small footprint of this lovely Chinese restaurant.  it looks small from the outside, but it has more room than it appears.  We ate lunch here and really enjoyed it.  My law partner had fried rice with dried scallops and egg whites and said it was delicious.  I had Mongolian Beef and it was a work of art.  The menu says it is ""spicy"" and by that it means that you don't taste the spice right away, it sneaks up on you as you're enjoying the dish and realize you're sweating a little bit.
The restaurant serves hot tea in a glass -- somewhat odd and rather hard to enjoy that way, but other than burning my fingers a few times, it was pretty tasty tea.
The locals say that Anthony Bourdain eats here.  Don't let that turn you off.  There's no weird food here, just good tasty food with great service."
"Ok. Tasty food but difficult if you've lived for quite a while in China. But it was good. We had Kung pao chicken, fried green beans and mapo tofu. Lots of foreign.  It much locals . 
We'd go back there."
"We visited late lunch time on Saturday. Fairly busy with quite a few Chinese looking people dining... the place looks and feels like traditional Chinese restaurants in the U.K. do, noisy, chaotic, tacky decor, etc... We were brought tea and water when we sat down, then we chose the special beef and seafood medley with noodles, both dishes came promptly and were just excellent! Tasty, fresh and perfectly cooked.  Service was good and prices fair."
"I went with colleagues who raved about R&G lounge.  I had heard great reports about this restaurant located just off Chinatown and I was starving!!! 

Firstly the service took forever.  It was packed.  No doubt it is a popular venue.

My crispy duck wasn't crispy enough tho there was a lot of fat making only 50% at most edible. One of my colleagues also had the duck and got served dumplings with it.  He offered to share his with me.  They were cold so I declined.  I asked for rice not believing that they would just serve a plate of fatty duck with nothing else.  The waiter looked at me in disbelief and said ""you want rice?!??!!  I got the rice which I devoured as there was not much to eat on the duck served.

Pricewise, the duck was $18 and I had one beer.  Some of my friends had 2 glasses of wine and the bill ended up at nearly $40!?!?!!

I wasn't overly impressed."
"This place is really a buzz: chaotic, noisy, busy - with a weird and highly eclectic ""décor"". However, the food was really good. There is a high customer turnover and booking is essential although ours got lost in translation somewhere. We thought a total cost of $231 for five people was amazing value for San Francisco where everything edible is expensive. We had a table right next to the kitchen and cleaning station so recommend not doing the same as the clatter, traffic of employees and noise was very high. But, the fact the place is packed with Chinese people also speaks volumes.

The place appears to be an icon but with such good food and high turnover, all must be doing well."
"We visited at the recommendation of our concierge at the Ritz Carlton Club in San Francisco.  We ordered cocktails, Giant Clam sashimi, Clams in Black Bean Sauce, Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab, and Garlic Sautéed Greens.  The cocktails of single malt scotch and vodka were served over a single large ice cube which is a really nice touch. All of the seafood was seasoned perfect and cooked to perfection.  The greens probably could have used a bit less oil but, were still great.  The Crab and Giant Clam stood out as I've never eaten crab prepared this way and the last time I had giant clam prepared similarly to this was in Hong Kong.  It is not a fancy place but rather, a very casual one so, my rating is not taking ambiance or decoration into consideration.  It's solely a food and service rating."
"This restaurant was recommended to us by a Chinatown shopkeeper. They warned - it's a bit pricey though. (I didn't think it was for the service and quality). I think if we hadn't been directed here, we wouldn't have known what it was! First, there is the name! Sounds like a bar, right? And then when you look in, it is! a kind of updated and chic version of Edward Hopper's Nighthawks... (Later we saw some people eating chinese food at that bar - so I guess that's where I'll go when I go alone). We were a 2-some. There is an upstairs and a downstairs apparently but they sent us up. We chose from the specials menu - dry chili shrimp, some sticky rice, and a great vegetable dish. It was fab. As a 2-some we had a little square table, but as the night wore on, we saw the staff roll out round table tops to put on the little tables to accommodate all sorts of sizes of groups! I found that pretty neato. Most of the clientele was Chinese, and I felt the waiter was worried we wouldn't be so happy but we were!! Each dish was about $20 so it was a bit pricey but there were linen table clothes and the service was responsive and the place was very nice! This was clearly a special event place for different sized groups, but we as a 2-some were treated very well. The shopkeepers who advised us to come here mentioned that President Obama ate here, and I can imagine that. They know what they are doing and the quality of their food is evident! I will definitely come again!!"
"Full of Cinese or ChineseAmericans, which is usually a good sign. However, despite some decent dishes, not a place we will return to, especially as the decor is not appealing."
"As a resident of Vancouver, I have high expectations to Cantonese cuisine. We had a lunch there when I was in San Francisco last month. It did not disappoint me. The foods are decent and authentic Cantonese style. The service is fast. And the price is reasonable. I would definitely come back again if I visit San Francisco."
We dined here last night and we were really disappointed to say the least.  Food was only ok and they rushed us from start to finish.. when we were just seated they wanted to take our order immediately and then we were not finished our starter when our main course was brought to our table. In total we were only there 40 minutes so that goes to show how rushed we were.
Very busy but very good Chinese restaurant just off the main drag from China Town.  Book a table so you don't have to wait.  Definitely order one of the Crab dishes (salt & pepper was amazing).  Special beef dish us also delicious as we're the lychee martinis :-)
"We visited the R&G Lounge about a week and a half ago when we were in SF. Since it was recommended by our friends, we booked a table ahead of time and anticipated a great dinner. However, despite of the reservation, we had to wait for another 45 minutes before we could get a table :(. 
After we ordered the food, the portions were small and the taste were just fair. Overrated reputation was in our minds and the worst came during the dinner when the waiters started to argue and swear at each other in the back! It's pretty embarrassing as most of us understand Chinese well. We had our dinner quickly and left with a bad and disappointing overall experience. 
Would I go back again? Not really!"
This restaurant was recommended by the staff at the Palace Hotel. Very good food. Busy place so go early or make a reservation.  We waited in line about 10 minutes.  Went for dinner around 6 PM so probably much busier later
"Visiting San Fran and due to the heat, we needed a spot with air conditioning. This place was great. The wait wasn't long, service was a little slow but it was packed so no complaints. The food was very very good. Had the R&G beef and rice. Fiance had the cashew chicken and pear martini. Everything was great and we were very happy with the experience."
"After checking in at the nearly Hilton, we had just enough time a pre-meeting lunch. The dining space is below-ground and a bit crowded, but the range of food was good and the pork tasty. Some staff had limited English but everybody was friendly and competent. I stay at this hotel often and R&G will be a pit stop."
My first visit in 2014 & 2016. I feel like the food here were best. But this time was just okay. Too bad.
"Been coming here for family dinners and special occasions for over 20 years!  Remember when the restaurant occupied the basement level before the expansion to the upper floors.  All the time, the level of service and quality of food were never compromised!

DO order the Salt and Pepper crab!  It's very lightly battered and deep fried to perfection.  You'll end up eating the coating because it's lightly sprinkled with fried garlic!  Other dishes worth mentioning are the minced seafood in lettuce cups, whole Peking duck, and R & G special beef (marinated beef cubes that are wok fried -'both savory and just slightly sweet).

This is definitely worth a visit and reservations highly recommended or expect a lengthy wait at peak times.  Service is efficient and helpful!"
Great authentic chinese in Chinatown.  This multifloor restaurant has a steady flow of customers and they are very efficiency at seating & serving promptly.  The food was excellent.  They even had options kids liked.
"Everyone we asked store clerk, bank guard, recommended R&G .We were early for lunch and got seated lower floor immediately. The restaurant filled very quickly .The 6 of us ordered 3 appetizers , 6 entrees , and a noodle dish. The waiter said maybe too much but we finished all and really enjoyed. Among dishes ordered Peking Duck with steamed buns with pocket to add their special sauce, duck ,scallions and a piece of crispy skin, The seafood tank was so tempting . We ordered the whole salt and pepper prawns in the shell. Both of our grandsons ordered R&G special beef with secret sauce . We always share courses but only one grandson was willing to share his beef but shared the other courses . Most of persons in restaurant were Asian.
Great lunch with varied flavors . Cost $150.25 and worth it ! A lot for lunch but served as our dinner and for dinner just luncheon food"
"We were in San Francisco looking for some good Chinese food.  While at a shoe store downtown the sales person recommended this place.  

Between the two of us we ordered 6 dishes.  It was truly amazing.  The standout dish was the Lobster.  We were floored.  Ever since then, when we go back to San Francisco, we have to hit R & G Lounge."
"The crab with garlic is fantastic, the abalone dish is gorgeous, and although I don't  eat this, my friends  said it was the best they'd had, also delicious. The ambiance is fun and energetic and the service prompt and friendly."
"Even though we got recommended to try this place, we had a really bad time. After having stood for one hour while waiting for a table, we got to eat really bad food. Moreover we were treated very impolitely and as soon as we finished our dish they brought us the check so that we could quickly leave. Do not know if it was just a bad day, but I really cannot find anything positive about this place."
Went there last night based on recommendation my my brother and brother in law .  Man is this restaurant great or what . Best black code fish I ever had.  Also crab was great . Honey pork was incredible also.  Peking duck was a disappointment .  It was not good and still had bones. First time in my life I had Peking duck where there are bones still . So don't order Peking duck here.  Great wine ! Definitely order the black cod and honey pork.
"We at at R&G Lounge while in San Francisco this past week. We called a day ahead to make a reservation on a weeknight just to be safe. We only waited for a short time when we arrived. Our daughter is an extremely picky eater and has to be convinced to try anything new. We ordered the Chow Mien for her and she loved it. We also tried the salmon avocado rolls and they were awesome. Our meals were great. Our meals were all delicious. We are used to the pretty basic Chinese restaurants and it surprised me a bit that meals are not served with rice, but that was actually a good thing since you can then actually enjoy the dish and not totally stuff yourself. 
As I read in other reviews, they do keep things moving along so you're meal with be sort of rushed, but that was fine with me."
"Had lunch here while visiting Chinatown.  Everyone enjoyed their meal from the egg rolls, to whole crispy crab, prawns with snow peas, mandarin beef and chicken with broccoli.  The crab was a big hit.  Service was very good."
One of our long time go to for Chinese. Reservations are strongly recommended here. Try and sit in the downstairs dining room - really gives you the ambiance of Chinatown. Food is awesome and service is quick.
"This place was recommended by our Lyft driver after a pickup/dropoff @ Coit Tower. It was near lunch time so we wanted to grab some good food nearby. He recommended two places because we specifically wanted dim sum. Unfortunately, we walked past his 1st suggestion because he said they would not have it and R&G would. WRONG! It turned out OK though because the food was very good! The place is very cramped and they were pretty busy, which I understand is the norm. It really was convenient to walk to from Coit but just know you will be navigating a steep descent down Kearny! But also know that you earned the right to eat whatever you want here because of that steep descent!
I liked the Sichuan Beef and my lady went for Salted Fish(which means it is really salty). Both were very good. My only complaint would be the service. Yes, it was busy but it took several minutes before a waiter stopped walking by us to take an order for drinks. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because everything else was great!"
"Visited here at the end of July, on our trip to San Fran. We got there early, just before 6pm.  Already very busy. But seated quickly.  Food came quickly too, and was delicious! Cheapest meal we had during our holiday to USA! Highly recommended!"
This place is really nice. Definitely make reservations they are busy because it's good. Sea bass is to die for. The place is very beautifully decorated and very clean. Many Chinese places don't care about appearance and concentrate more of just the food. R&G Lounge does both. Its beautiful upstairs.
"If you can get reservations, do.  If not, the wait is worth it!  We were only a party of two and noticed two seats open at the bar, so ended up eating there instead of the 1 hour plus wait.  The bar tender was great, Louie!  We had fun chatting with him while we ate and drank!  The food is fantastic, the fried crab is a must.  We also had spicy shrimp and Chinese water spinach!  All was great and we would go again if in SF!  Reminded us of some our our authentic Chinese at home in Houston, which are outstanding!"
"We each ordered several dishes to share and had enough food to choose from for verity of taste!  Seafood, noodles, vegetarian, soup and salad! The best was the seafood lettuce wrap which worked for some and not others. Overall it was a Busy restaurant and yummy for me but two of us didn't care for the dish they ordered. The service was good with friendly servers."
"We were told that this was authentic Chinese food. If that means that sauces are overly sweet and full of cornstarch, then I guess that was accurate!"
Best tasting crab I've ever had in my life amazing flavour and Freshness would eat there over and over and over again unbelievable amazing
"We had a really good experience with a friend to have dinner in this restaurant.  I was a bit surprised when they took us downstairs to find a delightful and cozy place to have our dinner.  The room was cool and fresh and bright, even thought we were in the basement.  Our dinner was very good, and we had the their famous crab, which was excellent.  We had some entertainment, one lady at another table had a seizure, so they had called 911.  E.M.T. came and it was as if they were invisible.  The staff of the restaurent went out of their way to make everything run smoothly.  After 20 minutes they removed the lady and took her to the hospital."
"Yes, there was a long wait and the staff seems to be rushing on a busy Saturday night. So if you look past that, you'll be in for very good food. It's not the quintessential fast Chinese food but more savory and authentic dishes. The lettuce cups were amazing and the honey spare ribs were also very good."
"We used to eat here with relatives almost weekly, but have not visited the restaurant for several years. Our visit tonight made me wonder why we ever bothered with this touristy restaurant in the first place. The food has, on some level, guttural appeal. However, it never changes. And since we spend a lot of time in Asia, it's hard to overlook the in-your-face coarseness of the food, which would be commensurate with a third-rate restaurant in Hong Kong. Couple that with the poorly managed, chaotic dining rooms (we arrived on time for an 8 pm reservation and were not seated until 8:50 pm--inexcusable these days), well, it's an experience that I won't care to repeat, ever. If I have to have Cantonese food in this town, I'll just put on a jacket and go to Hakkasan, whose food stands up to that now commonplace in Hong Kong."
"Extremely busy, we booked prior.

The restaurant had cramped searing, they'd obviously tried to squeeze as many covers in a possible.

Staff were unfriendly and unaccomadating to simple questions and requests.

They barely had time to stop long enough to take our order.

Then only one starter arrived about 10 minutes ahead of the others.

In summary, we weren't made to feel welcome and felt completely rushed.  Another surprise was that the kitchen closed at 9pm!!! 

There are many great restaurants in San Fran, go somewhere else that appreciates your custom not this place"
"Don't go looking for Chinese Food you would find in most American/Chinese Restaurants which for my 11 year old daughter was disappointed. However, the food was good. I had the cubed beef with macadamia nuts and my daughter had the broccoli/bacon/beef. Both were tasty and different. My complaint is with service. Never had the same person. Someone took our order, two different people brought out food and mine arrived at least 10 minutes after my daughter's. We also waited awhile for the check. So the food I'd give excellent, service just ok. Our bill was $49 for the two of us. Which I also thought was a little high."
"We dropped in without reservation on a Sunday evening st 8 pm. Roughly 40minutes later we got a table - customers coming 10 minutes later where informed that the house was full. Food was very good, service friendly but athmosphere a bit loud - but nothing that disturbed us. 
Only reason not to give 5 points was the fact that we received the starters with the main course. Definitely we would come back."
Went in for lunch and waited about 5 minutes for a table - downstairs- was 2:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was packed! Has the prawns with honey glazed walnuts - melted in my mouth - yum!!! And the house beef special - also incredible! - started with the pork appetizer - so good! The rice was a la carte...
"Our hotel was located near the R and G Lounge. We arrived around 1pm and found the food to be very flavorful, but the ambience to be just ""fair"".  We were seated in a very crowded walkway area, behind the bar and near the kitchen entrance.  For the price and the reputation that the hotel staff gave it, we expected a nicer place.  The food was good, especially the seafood dishes. But honestly, I have eaten better and more authentic in California."
"The restaurant came recommended by the locals. ....
It was great. Great service and delicious Chinese food 
We had their honey ribs, and a mixed vegetable dish with tofu, and  and scallops with beef and beans and macadamia nuts. 
We loved it.  The beef was so tender and the flavors were perfect. Dinner for two with tip was $62 and was very filling."
"My family was looking for a Chinese restaurant for lunch. Saw this restaurant on trip advisor and the name didn't sound like a typical Chinese restaurant. But the pictures and reviews seemed good. So we decided to try it out. 

When we arrived it was still closed so we waited for a few minutes. Before opening there were already quite a lot of people lining up. Good thing we were early. Despite not having a reservation we were accommodated easily. The waitress helped us order the set for the table which already includes all of their best sellers. The food was amazing. The cod and the salt and pepper crab was delicious. My family enjoyed the food so much that right after lunch we decided to make a reservation for dinner the next day. 

Our family really enjoyed the food. Will definitely come back when we go back to SF."
"When we arrived , there were eight of us, they gave us only ten minutes to order because the kitchen was closing. Thinking about it now we should have left then.Once ordered the meal came out in dribs and drabs so meals were getting cold before all arrived. It was very slap dash, then the staff just sat down at two nearby tables to eat leaving no one to serve. We were told the bar had closed when we asked for some drinks and they were putting tables on chairs around us. Bearing in mind the restaurant was Recommended by a Chinese lady at our hotel I think that the treatment we received was disgraceful and I will certainly be telling Titan our tour company to tell their clients to avoid the place."
Loved this place. The seafood food was brilliant and our waiter was polite unlike most Asian restaurants you visit. Definitely worth a visit for cantonese food.
"We were surprised to arrive at 4:45 pm and have the entire restaurant packed!  I believe we got the last table for two.  It's a real mix of clientele and seems that many locals do eat here.  The main dining seems to be downstairs, where we ate. It's not at all fancy except the waiters wear versions of tuxedos.  I had the prawns with honey walnuts and it was a dish to crave.  I loved every morsel!  My husband had spring rolls and said they were great.  He had Mongolian beef and loved that also.  You have to order rice as ""a separate item.""  Hot tea is brought automatically.  They have a full bar and we had a martini and wine.  The service was a bit spotty.  You didn't feel that our waiter was really engaged with us.  He eventually brought things correctly but we had to ask twice for water and he brought the martini straight up instead of on the rocks as requested.  It's about a 15 minute walk from Union Square.  I would definitely go back; as noted the food was delicious."
"This is probably one of the best Chinese food in SFO that's authentic in my view. Very busy and do book earlier for big party. I came here many times and the salt and pepper crab you can't miss.. fried Pigeon and oyster, roasted duck and  baked cod fish! Lovely and please don't miss if you look forward to have a good chinese meal in sfo."
"I was introduced to R & G Lounge many, many years ago and I enjoy dinner there every time I visit now.  The service is well paced, and I go specifically for the salt & pepper crab, their specialty,  There are other more traditional Chinese dishes that I enjoy as well if I am dining with others, but by myself, all I can handle is the crab.  A bit of white wine and one has an excellent meal.  I tried the R & G one time for lunch, but it was completely different and the menu was different, so now I go only for dinner."
"This place is great, food is amazing. Service was great, and the food came out quickly.  
Great place to check out!"
We selected this restaurant based on online reviews and they didn't disappoint. The food was very fresh and well prepared. Most selections were known Chinese favorites but there were some menu items we were not familiar with. The service was quick and efficient. China Town restaurants fill up quickly and I recommend making an early reservation and then take an early evening walk through lovely China Town.
"We were in the mood for Chinese food. This restaurant was well rated . No reservations needed if you come early . We were seated quickly at a table for two. Fairly crowded . Menu was varied: beef, seafood , chicken and vegetarian . We had the vegetable and salmon rolls as an appetizer, they were well done. My wife had the stir-fried beef with the chefs special sauce , she felt it was dry and overcooked, I had the cod with the Thai sauce it was somewhat sweet . The waiter was trying to clear the table before we were finished. We felt we were rushed to leave . Not an atmosphere for a relaxing dinner"
Ate things I've never had. Fried Dungeness crab in the shell. Work to get to the meat but tasty. Efficient service. Not cheap but a positive experience. Located in China town.
"Our driver recommended this restaurant to us.  There was no wait and we were seated on the basement level.  The prawn with walnut dish and special beef meals were recommended, but we were not crazy about them.  We did enjoy a spicy beef dish and the veg. fried rice.  Portions are large and the service is fast."
"This is our second time dinning here on our second trip to SF. It was introduced to us by asking local people, so it should be good. And it was good. The price was a little bit on the high side. But the food was fresh and delicious. We mostly ordered seafood, ox fish and shrimp. But their ox tail stew with red wine was also very delicious. The place filled up pretty fast too. Its Chinese name ""岭南小馆“, right off Chinatown."
"Had the salt and pepper crab which was really good. The spicy string beans were also well prepared. Not sure what is so special about the special beef. Found it to be overly sweet and a bit gummy. Not nearly as flavorful as other Chinese beefs We've  had. Service was good, not very personal, but they're focused on getting a lot of people through due to their popularity, so not to be expected. Would return to share the Crab experience with others."
"This is the first place you should try in Chinatown.  A great meal was had by the entire family.  We ordered a variety to try and were happy with everything.,  I would recommend you sit downstairs to hang out with the locals.  I would also recommend order as a group to try a lot of dishes."
"Our driver suggested that we try R& G which was close to our hotel for a good Chinese meal and he wasn't wrong. We went on a Thursday night and the place was filled to capacity. We didn't think we needed reservations and even so we would have waited if we had to, well we did...45 minutes. But well worth it. This place is not very large, although there are 2 floors and a very small bar area. There were some people waiting outside due to the crowding inside, but if you do pay close attention to your being called because they don't go outside looking for you.
They have a wine list, and a menu list filled with all sorts of main selections and delicacies. This isn't your typical Chinese take out place. No egg rolls, no sweet sour chicken types. Honey walnut prawns, the R&G  special, soup and avocado rolls is what we had. There are about 6 pages of choices. 
The restaurant is not quiet, very noisy and hectic. We waited just a few minutes to order and not long after our food was brought to us, placde in the center of the table for everyone to share. 
Definitely recommend and definitely make reservations!!"
"This restaurant came extremely highly recommended from a good friend of mine who is from and does business in China very regularly, as one of the best Chinese restaurants in the US.  Coincidentally, it was a stone's throw from my hotel. She had told me to be sure to get the Salt & Pepper Crab, which I sure did: AMAZING! 
I really enjoyed it! My dining partner had a beef, scallops and macadamia nuts dish, which was also really good. I saw some diners at one of the other tables enjoying a delicious looking fish, my waiter said it is another one of the restaurant's specialties: the abalone ( next time :-)). I had a side dish that was something similar to Vietnamese sauteed morning glory. It was good, however was overpriced- a plate of sauteed greens for $17. The wait staff was phenomenal. Very helpful, diligent and professional.  I was very lucky to get a table right away on a weekend night - no wait!!!! I congratulate R&G on their delicious cuisine and will make it a point to come back and try some of their other specialties. I recommend this restaurant for delicious Chinese food - make sure to get the salt & pepper crab!"
If you want some sound / authentic Chinese food in San Francisco this spot in Chinatown will not disappoint. Always busy when we visited but the service is efficient if not overly friendly.
"My wife and I went here based upon the recommendation of a local.  Even early in the evening the place was busy and loud.  We were given a number and sat down at the bar where we were served very quickly by a polite and courteous bartender.  After 15-20 minutes, my wife thought she heard a number after ours called.  When she went to ask the hostess, the claimed they called our number earlier. The place was loud and we were 10 feet away from her.  After waiting for another 15 minutes, we were seated upstairs.
The menu had lots of options.  It took 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us and another 5 before our orders were taken.  We were never asked about refills after we completed the drinks we had from the bar and had to ask multiple times for water.  Our food (Kung Pow Chicken and Scallops with XO Sauce) were good, but nothing great.  It was a disappointment and the lack of service added to the frustration."
Sati not up to expectations but everything else very good.  Very noisy as it was full.  They specialise in crab and it looked good though we did not have any lots of others did.  We had Mongolian lamb and a chicken dish.   Beware if you are allergic to MSG as I am.  You have to tell them as MSG is used in lots of the dishes.
"This place is just where you need to eat if you wanted authentic chinese food with quality and taste.  The crabs are very delightfully tasty,  next is the pecking duck with the steam buns are a must,  prawns with walnut is a good twist so go try them."
"This was an extremely busy restaurant, but the 40 minute wait for a table was well worth it. The entire dining experience was quite brilliant. Complex regional Chinese dishes were prepared in good time and were all delicious. The service was extremely courteous and efficient. Don't expect white tablecloths and knives/forks and spoons, unless you ask for them. Highly recommended"
Good food for lunch or dinner.  Its always busy so expect to wait.  Service is pretty good but can be slow b/c they are so busy.  Worth stopping in
I came here based on recommendation from hotel staff. I had the crab and it was very good. It was so good I went for a second meal. Service is so so but the food is excellent. Definitely a place to check at when in San Francisco Chinatown.

My family tried this restaurant upon recommendation of the concierge staff. We want a place where the locals go and not touristy and they pointed us to R&G. He recommended the deep fried dungeoness crab and we must say it was really that good. Even my kids who usually don't eat seafood tried it and they loved it. Both the first floor and basement were full of diners. Service was fast and food was really lovely. All the food that we ordered were delicious.
"Went here with a few of the family that helped celebrate my grandsons graduation from high school. Had Honey walnut shrimp, special beef plate, chicken chow neon, fried green beans , etc. service was good, food was good. Many local people from China town were our fellow diners, always a good sign."
"Four night stay in San Francisco and we had to have a trip in toChina Town. This restaurant came highly recommended so we gave it a go. Super meal in an exceptionally busy restaurant. Beware that it closes at 21.30 so avoid disappointment and give yourself plenty of time. Good food and in comparison to most SF venues, good prices."
"Free WiFi, clean, takes reservations. The food was fine, nothing was bad or great. We had Peking duck, wonton soup, mushroom chow mein and supreme fried rice. My friend and I would not go back. Way better food to be had in the area."
"Having eaten Chinese food in USA on previous occasions when I found the food to heavy I was impressed with the quality here.  A good sign immediately was the number of Chinese diners, some 80% of the clientele. My wife and I shared the seafood clay pot - delicious! Next time we'll go for the crab, a house speciality."
"The worst meal we've had in years.  Started when we sat down near a lovely wooden wall.  Unfortunately,  there were several layers of dust!  Attempted to order one of the specials, were told they were out, no suggestions were offered.  The only redeeming feature was the excellent hot and sour soup.  Both the peking duck and the roast duck were 90% fat and bone.  The skin was undercooked and flacid.  None of the typical crunch you would expect.  Both dishes were barely warm and the waiter ignore us throughout the meal.  Ours was the only table without condinments.  The ""sauce"" for the roast duck was pure soy sauce and served without rice.  Very disapointed as we were looking forward to a meal in Chinatown.  Stay away!!"
"This was by far the best Chinese food my huband and I ever had.  The Uber driver recommended it (he was Chinese) and was top of list on Local Eats.  Check out the beef dish, but the cod was awesome!"
"Excellent  and couteous service.  Very nice decor.  Now the menu!  A great variety. If with a group and you enjoy it, get the Crab special TO SHARE!!  before your entree!  Before our entree and after our salad, the four of us were needing a short break after eating this excellently prepared crab platter.  Use your hands!!"
Chinese restaurant on several floors serving typical chinese food of very high quality. The crab here is excellent and all the dishes look very tasty.
Went here with a few co-workers and everything was great! Had a 30 min wait on a Thursday not bad and a good sign that the food was good. 4 of us shared 4 dishes and some appetizers. Not huge portions but we were not hungry. You must get the crab dish-excellent! Would go back.
"R&G was recommended to us by our tour guide, and it was a great suggestion.  You walk into the front, into what is a bar, and the restaurant is downstairs.  There were many locals there, in fact, we may have been the only tourists there. As soon as we sat down, a hot pot of tea was brought to us.  I had the spicy scallops, and my son had the special beef. Both items were tasty, and there was plenty of food, and a reasonable price."
"Over priced and under fed. I ordered combination seafood for a carry out and what I received was mostly a box of noodles, only 2 shrimp 2 oysters and 2 scallops. The food was not very good and way over priced.  Don't go there."
"I hope you are fortunate enough to watch Louie mix drinks while juggling bottles at the bar. Superb service and delicious wonderful cocktails! 

The wait is spilled out into the street and for good reason. The place large with a big dining area downstairs.  Orders are taken promptly and the food arrives absolutely steaming hot very quickly. Order rice as extra side order. About half the tables appeared to order the whole deep fried crab...looked yummy. 

The accommodated our vegetarian requests flawlessly.  The flavor sure seemed authentic to me. And the majority of patrons were asian with very little English heard at the tables...another good sign.

Have an authentic Chinatown experience here! You'll be in good company.  Look for Louie the fabulous bartender."
"When they walked us back to the room they wanted us to eat in, I thought it kind of smelled like cat pee, but thought, ""What the heck?"" The food ended up being really good and the service was excellent"
"Our waiter was attentive and helpful with our questions, food was good and large portions. Go ahead and order the extra rice, one is not enough if you're a regular rice eater."

"Very nice  Chinese food off the beaten path. Not the American Chinese! Not cheap, very good! We would definitely come back."
"We had a wonderful dinner and the food was delicious, fresh, and healthy.The service was very warm and friendly."
Quality of food very good  3 or more people share the crab!! That just may be the start  hot and sour soup just spicy enough as were the spicy prawns
Great selection of the best Chinese food I have eaten. Fresh ingredients and cooked very well. Great variety of authentic Chinese dishes.
"This was recommended to us and we walked from our hotel about 1.5 miles. The service was excellent - wait staff dressed formally, they didn't take drink orders but brought everyone hot tea, we did ask for water as tea was fine. ,the Menu is huge and we decided to order different and share. Everything was amazing!  Most entrees were in the $18-20 but worth it. Ample portions to share."
This restaurant was recommended by our hotel as being one of the best in Chinatown. It felt professional as the staff took their job seriously and dressed formally. The food was plentiful and scrumptious and a reasonable price. Seafood is a specialty. This place is a must.
"We were told by the concierge at the Handlery that this was the best in Chinatown. Sorry to say not true, it was distinctly mediocre. The service was haphazard and you had to grab waiters as they shot by to ask where your food was, when the water was coming, and even though we ordered starters, they arrived after the first main dish, then the soup, then the other dishes and we had given up on the rice and when it came we had almost finished the meal. After the good recommendations we were disappointed. Would not recommend or revisit."
"Have the short ribs, stick rice, and walnut shrimp.  You will not be disappointed.  You know it is good if the locals eat there."
"I love this place, every time I come to San Francisco I make sure I stop by this place for some awesome fried crab. It seals in the flavor perfectly and is well seasoned."
"While vacationing in San Francisco, my wife and I had to go to Chinatown to eat Chinese food. The hotel recommended R & G Lounge which was a short walk away. It was a good recommendation. It was still busy at 8:30 p.m. on a Monday night so I figured it would be good. We enjoyed our seafood plates, especially the avocado and salmon rolls."
"We had a group of 5 and were seated upstairs quickly for dinner.  We ordered several of their dishes including the salt and pepper crab, peking duck, baked cod, and special beef.  The salt and pepper crab is one of those things you just have to try.  It was fun digging in and eating.  It's hard to eat, and you're going to make a mess, but that's part of the experience.  The baked cod was fantastic. It almost tasted more like Chilean sea bass and the portion was huge.  The peking duck was just ok, and the special beef was good. This was a good place to hang out and enjoy a meal while having fun.  The staff brought us drinks and fresh plates regularly. We felt well attended to.  I recommend it as a thing you should just try.  Our bill for the 5 of us was around $250 for food and several drinks."
"I was hopeful this place would be a delight, but we were totally Underwhelmed!  Food was so-so, nothing special.  They wanted fast turn around on the tables so very pushy when the check arrived.  If you closely at some of the decorative items (when you walk upstairs, look at the rock garden and vase next to it) and the railings, there was at least ONE INCH of dust!  Only gave it two stars because my husband's chicken dish was good (not great).  Go elsewhere."
"Staying in SF for a weekend, we felt like a meal in Chinatown was a must-do. The R & G Lounge comes billed as the place the Obamas eat and the review suggest that it is a foodie's heaven. We are, admittedly, not foodies and so we didn't venture to adventurously into the menu. One look at us and we were ushered to the lower ""casual"" dining room. Not sure what gets you through the upstairs doors. It was clean and fairly basic. The service was quick and the tea hot. 

I had the Lemon chicken. Keep in mind if you are from out of town, that restaurants here seem to be much more ala carte - so the steamed rice is an extra $2 on top of your meal cost. At $18, the lemon chicken was about the least expensive option and the most ""mainstream."" The chicken was tender although I ended up pulling off much of the fried, breaded covering as it was heavily greasy.  The lemon sauce was good.

My husband got the roast duck which was both very fatty and very salty. Again - he just got the duck, rice was extra. 

Drinking the tea keep our meal to $43 + tip so about in line with other meals that we had in town.

If you are a foodie and versed in traditional chinese cooking, I am sure that you would find this to be a great stop on your culinary tour. The meals around us were clearly enjoyed and impressive to look at.  If you are used to more pedantic fare, you may find that this checks the box of eating in China town but probably won't be your favorite meal of your trip."
We went to R&G Lounge after recommendations from not only our hotel and driver but from watching Anthony Bourdain as well. We made a reservation on Open Table...which I messed up...but then accommodated us anyway! The wait was very short and we got a table for 4 downstairs. Service was quick and the restaurant was crowded and lively. The Special Beef was very good...spicy chicken and broccoli was also good. Lemon chicken without the sauce was good...the sauce tasted like a melted lollipop...way too sweet. Chicken fried rice was not what you would expect...not fried at all but fresh and good. R&G is good but what you would expect. I would go back again and give them more points for letting us in with a messed up reservation!!!
"We ordered live crab salt and pepper, special beef, steamed clam with egg, sliced lamb with steamed buns, princess chicken and the stuffed chicken with glutinous rice which needed to be ordered a day in advance. All the dishes were good, they were unpretentious, tasty, fresh, delicate, exactly how Chinese food should be. The steamed clam with egg particularly stand out as this is not a common dish and it was done expertly. 

However we find the service at the reception below par. We made reservation but still have to wait for at least half an hour, no smile from the lady at the counter. I guess I can understand how they try to maximise spacing and have as many customer as possible for the night ( Friday) but we have young kids already tired for the day so it affects the experience quite a bit. If we are staying in a place that lacks great Chinese food then that is fine, we will wait but in a place like San Francisco that has lots of places to eat, maybe not....."
When we checked into the St. Francis hotel R & G Lounge came highly recommended.  We were thrilled to be in Chinatown and we were seated right away.  (Note that the restaurant is down a flight of stairs.)  Some of the staff do not speak English but they were all very attentive and were consistent in taking care of any question or need.  The portion sizes were small and the flavor was lacking in our dishes.  On the other hand I will be forever grateful to the server who noticed I had dropped my sunglasses under the table.  The check was about $100 for four of us- we only drank tea and water.
Great service and food at this Chinatown restaurant.  The food was delicious and wait staff attentive.
"The food was amazing 
We had green beens and the main was chicken with black bean sauce
Vry nice indeed 
Good to see waiters eating the meal at the end of the night too in the restaurant 
Service level was ok. But don't let that put you off.  I'd go back"
"This place had been highly recommended by a friend, an uber driver and most advisory sites so imagine our surprise to have the most mundane experience.   The first red flag was that the food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering suggesting that it was either rushed or pre-made... the fried rice was plain bad, the secret-sauce beef was overcooked and not tasty, egg rolls were meh... the attendants were nice and helpful but not enough to save the bad food experience. 

A side note is that another food review site indicated that the restaurant received a poor food safety inspection."
Famous for their salt pepper Dungeness crab but it was so over-breaded that I couldn't tell it was crab almost.  Busy place but resting on past glories.  R&G Beef that I used to love now just taste like strips of soy basted flank steak.  Pass on this dying institution.
"Went here based on reviews.
The place is listed well within China town eat spots.

We had a prawn dish and a duck dish. Also we had a calamari starter.
The starter and prawn main was really tasty however the duck dish was not good, very bland, very watery and fatty.
Also the duck dish came 20 minutes after the other prawn main. Which was already finished.

All in all a bad experience and something we walked away from thinking that was rubbish."
"Recommended to this place and wasn't disappointed at all. Recommend reservations because it get very crowded with mix of locals and visitors. Drinks, food and atmosphere were better than expected.   Definite a must for a Chinese stop while in San Francisco."
"A very typical chinese restaurant, completely run by chinese staff. The menu is not overly complicated, everything we ordered was very tasty. The atmosphere is what you can expect from a real chinese place, busy, not too mch"
Treat yourself to some of the best Chinese food in San Francisco!  It's a very popular restaurant and reservations are usually necessary.  I've been here many times and always thrilled.  Don't miss it!
Enjoyed a great dinner off the set menu which included lobster and abalone as part of a 10 course meal. It was well portioned out and served and the staff did a good job with so many people and different drinks and settings. The food was good Chinese cooking and we had a great time in a private room
"Albeit a bit touristy, the food here is delicious and they have a wide variety of menu items for every palate."
We had a reservation for 5 and our table was ready when we arrived. Service was prompt and helpful. Food was good (not exceptional) and arrived quickly. Peking Duck and RG Beef were excellent. Other items were more pedestrian.  Atmosphere is OK but not truly upscale and a bit loud. It is more comfortable than typical Chinatown restaurant. I would return given they take reservations and many Chinese restaurants do not take them.
"I went on a mission to have the salt and pepper crab. Truly fantastic and fun to eat. It does require some work but anything in life which is good doesn't come easy.
The staff was top notch and the portion plentiful"
"We decided we would take the recommendations from our server. Who happened to be a manager. We let go and waited to see what they brought us. 

When we walked in we noticed we were in the minority. We were surrounded with Chinese people obviously enjoying the bill of fare. We said, ""this is the place."" 
They seated us in the basement against a
wall. We were ready to chow down!

My two co-workers had never been to San Francisco's Chinatown which I think is the best in the US for food. 

So....
Full emersion was called for. 
And delivered. 

Probably a little more fried then I would have picked but the crab, fish, beef and chicken that was recommended was ordered and enjoyed. The rice was sticky with pineapple and the noodles were served with green onions. Both were very good. 

The crab deserves special mention. It was outstanding!

The tea was excellent and while I drink it at Chinese restaurants it is not something any of the three of us seek out. All 3 loved the tea and the meal.

Let them tell you what to order. You will not be dissatisfied. 

Recommended!"
We came here based on reviews at lunch time.  Perhaps we didn't know what to order but ended up having two specialty dishes that we found quite bland.  A quick look around the dining room and almost no one was eating what we were so perhaps there were better choices.  Service was good and the atmosphere was very authentic.
"We stopped by at 9 o'clock on a Tuesday night and were immediately ushered downstairs to the restaurant. It was surprisingly busy for so late and at the time we were the only Caucasians in the entire place which I usually take for a good sign. The great green beans, and pineapple fried rice were both really good but the shrimp stuffed tofu was just ok. This was a great first night in San Francisco."
Our tour guide suggested this Chinese restaurant for our recent visit to San Francisco.  The food there was fantastic and the service was the best.  I'd go back today if I weren't already home in Kansas!
"I'm a huge fan of whole Dungeness crab and I live on the east coast. So whenever I'm on the west coast, it's a top priority for me to enjoy as much of it as I can. Through various SF reviews, I learned of the house specialty of this Chinatown restaurant - Salt & Pepper Fried Whole Dungeness. It was a must try to me.

The venue is clean and busy, though outdated in appearance and furnishing. It certainly feels authentic. That's good. You want the locals feel, and this is that. We arrived just before the evening rush, so we were seated right away. Our server was fair at best, and possibly even rude and poor, if I'm being critically honest. He explained nothing to us, spoke very little at all really, and we didn't feel welcome. That said, he took our orders quickly, and did all the duties of serving us efficiently. I guess personality and hospitality weren't his strong suits. But his attitude was highly noticed. 

I think (and I'm left to question because of the lack of information provided), that this is set up like family style dining. The tables are set that way. But we weren't offered any option like that. I of course ordered what I came for - the crab. It's a huge portion most likely meant to be shared, but who knows. My wife ordered some type of beef and it just came by itself with nothing else. A huge pile of beef. Very odd. The waiter could have guided us. That's why the rating is a 2. The Crab? Honestly, it's not that good. Mine was over fried, incredibly messy to eat, and it tasted pretty bland considering all the hoopla over the reviews, minus the blasts of black pepper. A little melted butter would have gone a long way in helping, but the waiter wasn't interested in us as customers. 

My advice? Stick to regular whole Crab at many of SF's great venues, and pick another spot to experience great Chinese food in the area. This was an expensive disappointment."
"I have a dinner with my colleagues in a weekday.  Though there are two floors for the restautrant (and another one at the street level but it is mainly the bar), it is always busy especially during the dinner time.   It is lucky that we have made an advanced reservation to avoid a long wait!  Actually,  we passed by this restrautant twice in the previous two days, one at about 7pm and another at around 8pm, and we were told to wait for 20~45 minutes if no reservation is made.

The menu is extensive.   There are daily special and there are also many dishes that are not traditional Cantonese styles.  Nevertheless,  we prefer to order Cantonese food only as it is the best that the cook can prepare.   Seafood including lobster and prawn is good, Cantonese BBQ style pork and duck are excellent, and the fried rice is very tasty.  Note that the price is kind of mid range and we spend about USD 50 per person including tips.

The only drawback is that the restrautant does not self Cantonese style dessert.  They have ice cream only :("
"Of all of the Chinese restaurants I have visited in my life, this spot's vegetarian selection was fair. I had the moo shoo vegetable which was splendid - smallish portion, compared to my NYC Chinese favorite haunts but reasonable all the same. The tables surrounding us all seemed to be ordering awesome meat concoctions and I had the sense that if we ate fish or beef, we would have been much more impressed. A solid spot but nothing amazing for a vegetarian."
Our taxi driver told us that R & G  Lounge was a good choice and we certainly enjoyed our food and service. Visited on an early Friday evening and didn't need a reservation.
The Chinese food here is delicious my daughter fell in love with this restaurant. Very authentic Chinese cuisine.
"We were told we'd have to wait, but 45 min! And all she would say when we asked how long was '.soon'  food was just average, best thing was the special beef"
"Succulent and crispy Peking Duck, flavorful green beans, shrimp fried rice, seafood. All fresh and prepared with care.  Don't let the long lines scare you. Grab a drink or beer at the bar and put your name in.  It is worth the wait."
"We had a reservation and were seated promptly upstairs. Had the crabs which were devoured, as well as Cantonese noodles, fried rice, veggies, fish and crispy chicken. Everything was delicious and so much better than the Chinese food we get at home in New Jersey. Wish I could visit this place more often."
"I have been going to R & G Lounge for years and if there is one fish that only gets better with the passage of time, it is their signature dish - the Salt and Pepper Crabs!  Thus us the one dish that I will order over and over again and it always wow my guests and myself to no end!!  The thinly breaded and then deep fried Crabs are simply sublime!  It is finger licking good and there is not a single restaurant that has been able to rival R & G in the taste, freshness and deliciousness of this dish!  

All their other dishes are really great as well.  I particularly enjoyed their stir fried veggies with garlic, the Glutinous rice with Chinese sausages, and the most baked tender cod fish anywhere!

It is the best restaurant in SF Chinatown, hands down!"
"Great food, great service.  Reasonable prices.  Only reason not 5 star was it was noisy and the wait was a bit long.  Worth the wait though!"
"it is a bit out of the beaten path, and we did have to go down to the basement to eat, bit it was well worth the trip.  some amazing Wonton Soup and some very good Peking Duck.  The service was enthusiastic and very friendly.  Our cab driver recommended this restaurant as being the cleanest Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.  He may be right.  I will be back to try more!"
"We were in San Francisco on business, so didn't stay in our usual area.  The hotel recommended this restaurant - which is always kind of risky.   We were quite pleasantly surprised - while the exterior of the building doesn't really seem inviting or impressive, the food was delicious - every appetizer and entree was fresh, prepared well and looked appetizing in addition to just being so tasty! - but the service was noticeably more considerate of the ""locals"" or regular customers, versus those of us who so obviously read the menus and had not been there before.   While it was good, I would not make a special return trip ........."
"So we read such great reviews of this place and we decided to try it for lunch.  Not sure if I'm just picky or if we came at an off day.  The food is underwhelming and the staff is tolerable at best.  

Be careful,  they give you a dinner menu but they also have a lunch menu which we later found out about.  The prices are completely different for the same food.  Dinner is twice as much."
The dungeness crab was one of the best I've had. Many napkins were required as this is strictly a hands on experience. The mushroom medley was so fresh that each type of mushroom maintained a different taste and texture. Service was impeccable. Cloth on tables and in lap. Will definitely eat here again.
"This place is definitely a hidden gem. We were taken here by a friend whilst on a trip to San Francisco. The outside does not look like much at first - just what you would expect from any bog-standard asian themed restaurant - but it blew our minds (and tastebuds) away! Everything we tried was honestly delicious (there were six of us, we ordered a lot of food and shared everything)! We did have to queue at the door for a little while as we had not made a reservation, but it was worth the wait. In particular, I recommend you try the crab and the black cod. Everything was good but the thought of those 2 dishes in particular still makes me salivate! :-)"
"We discovered R & G Lounge a few years ago and now we make sure we eat there every time we visit San Francisco. Their menu is varied and authentic. I love experiencing the atmosphere in which I (a Caucasian) am the minority, surrounded by language, decor, and food which is all rich in Chinese immigrant tradition. For me R & G is a positive, exciting, and delicious experience."
"I've saved a newspaper review of the R & G for 3 years hoping to visit on one of my trips to SFO.  Finally !  Chinatown !  The R & G is typical Chinatown in that it's a non descript place with the actual restaurant in the basement.  Once directed there it smells a bit funky.  But it's the classic Chinese funky so all's good.  Wait staff was a blur of service.  We had a group of VIP Chinese business men next to us and it w's obvious that THEY were the priority.  But it's all good !  As it was part of the experience.  

Once our waiter knew his job was secure having waited on the local biz group - service was efficient.  We thought about the signature Salt & Pepper Crab but elected to go lite - Egg Rolls, Corn Chicken Chowder (killer !) plus BBQ Pork with Jasmine Rice.  All was great and we had a beer and wine.  We never really connected with our waiter but that's part of the charm.  Accept that you are an outsider and all will be fine.  Drink in the local business going down.  Maybe the signature Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab will be our meal next time :-)). We'll be back"
I think the usual tourist walking route through China is to walk up Grant Avenue and that is it. But then you will miss one of the best Chinese dining experiences in the city. The multi level restaurant is packed with people enjoying the great cooking. From the house special beef with the chef secret sauce through to birds nest soup is a winner on the menu. Definitely worth a repeat visit
Recommended by a friend. Ate seafood rice and waiters suggestion of chicken dish.  Bath were so average.  We were looking forward to a great meal to brighten up the bad weather day. Nope.
"Visiting from Seattle and I'm always in good hands with my brother-in-law when I comes to food and wine. I don't even know why I attempt to order. We came here our first night of five for city dining. We had the signature Salt and pepper Dungeoness crab which this was the wow factor.  Extremely tender meat and you never stop licking and sucking on your fingers. It is pretty addictive. 
Also, we had their signature beef and very fresh tasting fried rice with seafood.  The beef is tender and a nice flavoring with just a very hint of sweetness on the finish. The fried rice was fresh and bright.  One of the better I have ever had."
"Chinatown pretty much closes down on Sunday night.  What a treat to find this place 

Great food. Great service. 

Don't order the calamari.  Too greasy deep fried.  They could improve this. 

Stick to seafood/duck/noodles and rice. Mongolian beef is amazing.  As is the pea pods and prawns. Special sticky rice superb."
We finally made it to R & G Lounge in Chinatown in SF. We have read many good reviews about the great food quality and service. We went at 6pm on a Tuesday night and was already a waiting list but went by quick. We were seated and the server was right there to get your order. If you want the dinner to last a while you need to take control and take control because you will be out the door real quick. The food was very good and we will be back
"Was recommended by a client in SF.  Decided to go with my two sales reps. We had one of the best meals in a long time. Don't let the small frontage and simple decode fool you. Good service overall.
Had great seafood lettuce wraps. Strip dish which was fresh and tasty. Shrimp fried rice was light and simply good. And the best was the duck. Best duck I had in years and the best in any Chinese restaurant in SF. 
Can't wait to go back when I'm in SF next month again."
The foods were mostly good but too expensive. The Secret beef was a little bland and the shrimp was greasy.
We hadn't been here for about five years so we were excited  to go back.  It has only gotten better.  The staff was attentive and organized and the food was excellent.  We got ours to go this time and it was delicious.  This is a fun place to go and we will definitely be back.
"Our meals were good but after a trip to NYC last month we wanted to compare both China towns, NYC was better.  My husband ordered a soup - 1 minute later his entrée 5 minutes later my entrée. Food times could have better synchronized. Overall decent meals but quickly forgotten.

Parking garage located one block away restaurant will validate after a $50 purchase."
"Our family always picks this restaurant for our Chinese New Year celebration. And when special guests arrived in our city.  This time, as a last minute idea, we took savvy gourmet guests from Bangkok here.

First the crowds waiting for tables were impressive.  To our guests, we are accustom to the crowds.  We ordered their special salt and pepper CRAB and it was DELICIOUS and so fresh.

Our guests ordered other dishes but the crab was memorable."
"Some of the best Chinese food I've had. The special beef and the fried calamari were very good. Service is pretty good, crowded and busy restaurant. I would recommend if you are in the area."
"We ordered the following:

1) Special Beef
2) Black Cod (thai chilly style)

I was surprised to see a Thai style cod on the menu, perhaps this is a Cantonese thing, perhaps not (I've only spent limited time in Hong Kong), but nevertheless it was quite enjoyable. Perfectly fried, utterly tender and creamy, and topped with an incredibly delicious sauce. Perhaps a bit too sweet, certainly not high end cuisine, but if you are looking to enjoy yourself you can't go wrong with this dish. 

The secret special beef was indeed perplexing. Absolutely tender and delicious, nearly addictive, I can not for the life of me figure out the seasoning mix. Strangely tastes like the KFC secret blend of spices in a Cantonese setting, Ha! 

Enjoy. Not cheap, but yet still worth it."
"While the service and dining room could use a bit of sprucing up, the food is just so damned good you won't really care. Best walnut prawns, salt & pepper seafood and Peking duck, and all of their beef dishes are really excellent. Will go back again and again."
"We had a variety of food: egg rolls, satay, chicken, fried shrimps, rice and duck; all tasted very good. I highly recommend the shrimps and the chicken and also to book ahead of time because it is very crowded."
"While highly recommended by TA and others, the huge Christmas day crowd probably caused a hit or miss aspect on our food.  The hot and sour soup was outstanding as was the BBQ pork appetizer.  The lemon chicken and salt/pepper crab was also very good.  But my soy sauce duck was cold for the most part.  The service was outstanding given the rush, but we were not told that we had to order rice to go with our lunch.  Really?   So finally got that as well.  A slice of Chinatown but just not on a crazy busy day."
"It's been years since I've been to R&G Lounge.  We went there on a whim to check how long the wait will be for a table for party of two. We waited for 20 minutes and were seated downstairs. We ordered the Westlake soup, pan fried noodles and their famous R&G beef. A 20 minute wait for a table was worth it. Next time I'll come back and I'll order the crab. More fun to go there with a large party/group."
Our family enjoyed a hot and tasty meal at R&G's last night. Conveniently located by our hotel (Hilton) we walked a short distance for an early dinner. Soup portions (cup) were large and warm. I hate soup when it is cold. We finished all our dishes which is rare for the four of us. Recommended!
"R and G Lounge is in the Chinatown district of San Francisco. We chose to eat an evening meal here after seeing some positive recommendations on the Internet. We were overall quite disappointed with our meal. My husband ordered salt and pepper squid as an appetiser. When it came, the portion was enormous, far too much for a starter. The batter was very heavy and the dish overall lacked flavour. My beef and chicken satay skewers were a little better, but there was no real satay flavour to the sauce. Our main courses were more flavourful, we enjoyed beef wth macadamia nuts. Service was poor, we waited a long time for our first drinks order and my husband had to chase staff three times for his order of a second glass of wine. By the time it arrived he had virtually finished his food. No one seemed very bothered or apologetic at our wait. The tables are very close together so our enjoyment was further eroded by a loud self opinionated diner on the table next to ours. I would not recommend this restaurant, at over $100 for the food and drink it was not good value for money. The meal and overall dining experience were indifferent. Our local take away at home does better food for a fraction of the price."
"My brother and I recently spent a rainy Saturday afternoon wandering through San Francisco’s Chinatown. Getting hungry from walking and Xmas shopping, we asked two different staff people in different stores for the name of a good place: both immediately recommended the R & G Restaurant, so we decided to give it a try.

We stepped in at 3 pm and the place was humming – it’s always a good indication when a restaurant is busy in the middle of the afternoon. We were directed downstairs, and started with hot and sour soup – which was not too spicy, not too thick, with good texture, and which we both rated an 8/10. We followed this with Mu shu pork, which my bro described as kind of a Chinese taco. I hadn’t had it before, but aside from being a little messy, it was quite an enjoyable dish, and the six large crepes were perfect for the purpose. My bro described it as “Amazing!...it’s great!” and I have to concur; we’d rate it 8.5/10. Our final dish was Three treasures with black bean sauce. My younger brother is admittedly not an eggplant fan, but he really liked the way this was prepared; he liked the shrimp and tanginess. The dish had a nice slightly crisp texture, rather than being soggy and overcooked. We rated it a strong 7.5-8/10.

Service was good, although the servers appeared to be a bit rushed. Not surprising, considering how busy the place was.

Our overall rating: 8.5/10. Awesome place; we recommend the R & G wholeheartedly!"
"The food here never misses.  Very consistent whether it is lunch or dinner, whether it is crowded or not crowded.  Probably my favorite two dishes are the Prawns with Scrambled Eggs and the R&G Special Beef.  You are thinking how special can Prawns with Scrambled Eggs be, well I've tried to make it numerous times at home from different recipes and never even get close to the luxurious and delicious version at this restaurant.  The R&G Special Beef should be considered a mandatory item to order.  The food always comes out hot because they bring it out upon completion, not all at once.  All the vegetable choices are fresh tasting and yummy.  The Black Cod is fantastic but takes about 45 minutes to cook so allow time.

Any local knows the place gets very crowded especially on weekends.  Best to avoid during busy times if you can manage it.  

I have two gripes with R&G.  My significant gripe is that the place is starting to feel just plain dirty.  The place is in serious need of a floor to ceiling cleaning.  The floors, bathrooms, and even the paint are all dingy, tired and shabby.  It's not the cool patina of Tadich Grill, it's an oily dirty ""film"" all over the place.  I hope the kitchen is cleaner than the restrooms but it makes you wonder.

My other smaller gripe is that the portions seem to be getting smaller and smaller over the years as the prices go the opposite direction.  Frankly, I'd rather pay more and get more.   The rule of thumb in most Chinese restaurants is that everybody picks one thing and the whole table shares.  Always ends up being about the right amount of food.  At R&G, with the shrinking portions, you better figure one extra dish for your group or more if it’s a larger group.  I.e. Five dishes for four people or eight dishes for a party of six.

All and all, R&G is still my go to spot for Chinese in The City but I thorough cleaning would make it even more enjoyable."
We visited here and found a warm welcome food was excellent and the advice given by the waiter was well worth listening too would definitely visit again
"Spent an amazing day on the trolley and fishermans wharf, but the highlight was dinner around R&G Lounge. The service was quick but courteous, the spare ribs were finger licking good, the crab; OMGOODNESS. I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it. Huge, naturally sweet meat, tender, succulent, yummy deliciousness. Can't wait to go back."
This restaurant is a must for Crab lovers. Their fried crab is delicious - the meat on the crab..oh my...so much. It may be pricey for some but seriously worth it! This is my second time here and will always come back here when in SF.
"Started with shark fin soup (YUM!!) and a meat platter with seaweed and octopus. Then had the famous crab, lobster and delicious beef soup with radish (or was it turnip?). The beef with scallops was superb. The mushrooms and bok choy was good. I was too full for the fish and bean dessert. 
Definitely going back for crab and the beef soup- I think at lunch it comes with noodles."
"We came here at the recommendation of our hotel and were not disappointed. All of the dishes were well-prepared. The crab was a hit at the table, as well as the Peking Duck. I would eat here again the next time I am in the area."
"Our overseas friend's  favorite restaurant in SFO whenever he is in Town ! Now its our favorite restaurant when we have friends in town ! Very good service and attentive staffs . The fresh Dungeness crab and tender Beef stew are a must have here ! Cabt wait to come back to try other dishes . A very busy place especially for weekend dinner , so a Reservation is recommended to avoid long wait"
Good food. Spring roll and barbecue pork is good. Sticky rice is super yummy that you can't miss it. Waiters are nice but not very attentive. Environment is very casual Hong Kong style. That means don't expect too much. Price is average. A Michelin recommended restaurant.
This restaurant was recommended by a waiter at Gary Danko. Said best Chinese in city. He was right. The place was busy as a bee hive. It took us about 15 minutes to get seated. The service was outstanding. The waiter gave us great recommendations on appetizers and entrées. The Peking duck was fantastic. So were the egg rolls and soup. This is an unconventional Thanksgiving but great when you were out of town. Highly recommend
"I don't understand why more people who visit San Francisco don't come to Chinatown to have the closest to authentic Chinese food in the U.S. I grew up in Hong Kong, so I can say that I've had my share of Asian cuisine. This restaurant is worth a visit. When I come back to SF, I'll be back to try some other dishes."
"Went for dinner with a party of six at the recommendation of our hotel concierge. Food was Ok, nothing spectacular. Service, though quick, was impersonal. We saw other tables getting this great looking crab appetizer and asked our server what it was. He said it was there most popular app. This was after we ordered entrees. Would have been nice for him to mention this a little earlier."
"Your typical Cantonese style dishes in SF. Average in my opinion and bordering too greasy. However, it is acceptable if you are craving for something Asian."
"The R&G Lounge was recommended to us by a local shopkeeper on the strength of the noodle and soup dishes after we asked about a suitable place for an early evening meal, and we weren't disappointed. Service was excellent, with the waiter not only providing quick service but also suggesting lower price dishes for best value. Mrs P is the daughter of a Chinese restauranteur and found both the Cantonese bias of the food and the authenticity of the dishes much to her liking, which for me is about the biggest recommendation I can make. With very good VFM and lots of local trade I'd definitely eat here again."
"The food is not bad but the service is hostile! Probably because we are not Chinese but they forget to deliver the food ( just got part of it) and full stress all the time! So, don't believe in 4 stars ! This is a 1-2 star"
"We were advised by our taxi driver that the R & G Lounge served really good food so we took his advice and stopped in for a quick lunch. Like many restaurants in and around Union Square, it was downstairs. Although it was crowded, we were seated within minutes even though it was in the very back of the restaurant and near the restrooms. We ordered tea, vegetable eggs rolls and an order of chicken chow mein, which we shared. The tea was good, the egg rolls were very good and the chicken chow mein was bland and virtually tasteless. The service was ok and the prices were fair. I've had much better."
"This restaurant was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. When we went into be seated I was surprised that the restaurant is actually in the basement of the building. When you go down the steps you are overwhelmed with the smell of the fish in the aquarium and also what continually permeated the air was some sort of scented air freshener coming from the bathroom area.  The waiters were rude, they were in a hurry and even though there were quite a few empty tables, insisted on squeezing our table of six into a table for four.  Then they had to rearrange us so that the one gentleman that was quite large would not be seated towards the kitchen because it was too crowded to get past him. When we try to order the waiter was very difficult to understand and only brought out some of the things that we ordered and substituted pricier things that he chose for our group!  The bill was close to $250 for the six of us, and most of us left hungry. Not a good experience. The fried fish entrée was the best thing that we had. I never did find out what it was except that it had honey in the sauce. If you can figure out what that was I would recommend it.  They also serve deep-fried Dungeness crab, which we did not order and they brought to our table to the tune of $64."
"Loved this place for a ChinaTown location dinner. Lots of seafood. Great fried rice ever. Service was nice and gave helpful advice! Busy !!! There is a private room for about 25-35 people, not decorated but private!
I like the food better than some of the well rated smaller restaurants around the area!
Recommend for lunch or dinner for a Chinatown location!"
"Always full!  A reminder of how Authentic Chinese food tastes like, but not quite there. One of the better Chinese restaurants in San Francisco; never disappoints."
"I had a horrible experience. Came on a Tuesday night with some family visiting from China. We came around 7:00 and there was no wait so they seated us fairly quickly. The waiter tried to sell us on a $60 bowl of soup which we swiftly declined. 
The food was okay, but way too expensive for Chinese food of his quality. We ordered one rice dish for a group of five and asked the waiter whether we should get some additional bowls of rice and he said no because we already had a rice dish. Turns out we did need additional rice. 
At some point during the meal, they asked us whether they could move our table about a foot over so that they can set up a huge table next to us. They told us they could just move the table without us getting up and they pulled our table right into my uncle, almost hitting him. They then rolled a giant round table top by us and almost knocked my sister in the head as they put it onto the table next to us. There was a lot of other movement of furniture throughout the dining room during our meal. 
I heard the waitstaff refer to a waiting guest as a ""white ghost girl"" in Cantonese. As you can imagine, it is a racial slur and the girl was just waiting for her table and hadn't done anything to annoy them so far as I can tell. 
They removed our dinner plates while members of our party were still eating. They brought us the check without our asking, and while one of our party was still eating. They took my payment while one of our party was still eating. They took the signed check while we were still sitting. Clearly, they were rushing us out. Lest you think we had been sitting there forever, we were in and out in about 50 minutes. 
When we walked outside, we saw two giant tour buses parked out front so clearly they were rushing us out to get the bus loads of tourists in. I imagine they have a deal with the bus companies to bring them tons of business. I can't imagine that they would otherwise get so much business with such wretched service. 
I got diarrhea as soon as I got home about 30 minutes later. Just saw that Yelp listed this place as having a poor health score. Wish I had seen it before I took my out of town guests there. I'm terribly embarrassed at having exposed them to such a negative experience on their first trip to San Francisco. Would not recommend this place under any circumstances."
"The food at R&G is typical of a good Chinese Restaurant.
Their signature crab dish was good. We also ordered prawns, which was served with pecan nuts. An interesting combination.
Spare ribs in black bean sauce was too sweet.
Tau fu was nicely caramelized.
Chicken was uninspiring.
Beef was more like jerky! Too dry.

Overall, I thought food was alright, but not anywhere near a Michelin Star rating!"
"I came here several times now, usually two people, sometimes more. It is hard to get a seat on weekends, with waiting time normally half an hour. You could choose to eat at bar without waiting in that case if it's just two of you. 

The No. 1 recommended dish is definitely the ""Fried with garlic and hot pepper"" crab. If you are not in an appetite of ordering a whole crab, then you could order ""salt and pepper"" crab because they only offer half-size crab dish in this version. 

Another dish I really liked is their Beef Brisket and Turnip in a clay pot. 

Since I sat at the bar so many times now, I would also like to recommend their cocktails. The bar tender was excellent."
"I searched and searched for a good China Town restaurant and found this one here on TA. It was good, but nothing special. A lot of locals seem to eat here which is nice. We saw a lot of large family eating here. The staff is nice, but lack personality, except the bar tender. He was very very nice and accommodating."
"service was Horrid... dishes were very small portions...
wait was long during the week - too many great places in Chinatown to go here again."
"This was recommended to us as the best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. We were not disappointed. We didn't have a reservation so we're booked into their system and told to come back in 30 minutes. We returned and had our table just as promised.

The menu is extensive and interesting. The food was really good , efficiently and promptly served. The taste and quality of what we ate was great.

Highly recommend this place."
"Visited here in October 2016. It was recommended by our bus tour guide. We figured that if the Obamas eat here when in San Francisco, why not us. Service was fairly pquick. Food was delicious. They serve hot tea with your meal."
"The R & G Lounge was recommended us by friends as the ""best Chinese food"" in San Francisco. It has some high ratings on the Web and some pretty famous people dine there.  Unfortunately, on Wednesday, Oct. 12, it did not come anywhere near to living up to its reputation.  We ordered Double Boiled Chicken Soup, Fried Oysters, Special Beef, Barbecued Pork, and Honey Spareribs. The only thing that could be described as good was the soup, which had a thick, flavorful broth and lots of chunky chicken and vegetables. Going down the list:  The fried oysters were coated in thick, chewy batter and neither the oysters nor the batter had any flavor; the special beef was a very poor, fatty, gristly cut of beef, sliced thin and overcooked  and oversauced to hide the poor quality; the barbecued pork was somehow dry and fatty at the same time; and the honey spareribs were drenched in honey, which was clearly a cover for another cheap cut of mear that was tough and full of gristle. There was not a vegetable to be seen except for some shredded lettuce under the oysters and we had to ask for a bowl of rice.  This meal cost well over $100 and was simply horrible - actually worse than what you might get for $7 at a food court in an American shopping mall,  I don't know if it was a bad night or what, but I recommend that you pass this one up."
"Their speciality is their signature crab deep fried very tasty
They have lounge upstairs so you can have a drink while u wait for a table"
"Our October dinner at this handicap accessible, average furnished restaurant yielded very good Chinese food at above average to high prices.  This restaurant is very popular, even visited years ago by Anthony Bourdain, so go early or you will have to wait in line.  Bourdain had the salt & pepper crab, which was on about 2/3 of the diners’ tables, when we visited.  If you do not want to splurge on the very costly crab, there are less expensive salt and pepper entrees.  

The menu is intimidating if you do not know your Chinese food and cannot read Chinese.  Thankfully, most dishes on the menu have pictures, though that does not help you with how the dish is seasoned.

The service was below average.  They get orders confused, though waiters rushed to get the food out as soon as it is ready.  During our visit, the waiter did not check on us to see how we were doing.  Unfortunately, they forgot one of our dishes.  We eventually got the dish after we reminded the waiter, when he was about to give us the bill. 
  
•	R &G Special Beef  ($20)– marinated beef that is deep fried – it had a great sweet soy flavor.   

•	House Special Fried Rice ($15) – Bland and rather pricey.

•	Prawns with Honey and Walnuts ($20) – It was quite good."
This is a very busy restaurant but they found us a table quite quickly. The spring rolls were good but the beef was chewy and my husband wasn't keen on the prawns & walnuts. We had also ordered Chow Mien but it didn't appear and they were offhand when we mentioned it. Have had much better Chinese food in Wales!
"A tipical chinese restaurant in the Chinese neighborhood.
Fast attending, well priced and a comfortable environment.
But it was disappointing, since the soup was tasteless and everything but the crab was just regular.
Go for the crab!"
R&G is a must stop for my visits to SF. I ordered the full salt and pepper crab at $43 for the market price. This was first experience eating crab in its shell and Andy the waiter patiently showed me how to crack the legs etc. It was delicious. I have never gone wrong with anything I have ordered here. Service is generally very good and this place is crowded with Chinese customers.
"We went to Chinatown on our tour stop, and while visiting all the little shops, I asked the. Shopkeepers what the best place was in Chinatown to eat, and they ALL said R &.  G Lounge. And they were right!  We were the only"" non-Asians there, so we knew we were in a genuine authentic restaurant."
"My friends and I went here on the recommendation of locals we had met and talked to.  None of the 5 of us were impressed with the food or location.  The place wasn't the cleanest.  We sat downstairs, which was a big deal. The service was so horrible, I will NEVER be back. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't even send my worst enemy here.  We had to beg for drinks and we were sitting right next to the drink counter!  We finally got drinks after 15 mins of being seated and asking several people.  We also had to constantly ask about our food and refills (which we never got after being there for well over an hour). The shrimp was super disappointing.  My food came out 20-25 minutes after all my friends' food did.  This meant that everyone else was very much done with eating by the time I even got my food.  And to top it off, my food wasn't even hot when it arrived!  The beef was ok but very much not worth the wait.  We were so disappointed in this place.  We had really high hopes!"
"We were there for a lunch, so the place was full. Service was not very good, waitress was a bit rude to us, but the bigger issue was the speed - it took them a lot of time to get our order and even more to bring the food to the table (we spend 30-40 minutes on an empty table). The food was disappointing, I feel there are way better places in Chinatown."
"On 10/1 evening we celebrate my brother in law birthday. Our booking was 5:30pm and it was nearly a full house . If one wants to have dinner in the peak hour , it's better to book it a week ahead! As usual we picked the favorite dishes in the house . The taste is always the same and won't let you down. It seems a place for all kind of people ! Don't miss it if you are visiting SF!"
"This was a good find. The restaurant is on 2 levels and you are spoilt for choice, the staff are very helpful and happy to explain any dishes. The food is very tasty. Free tea is provided with your meal."
"I went to this restaurant for lunch during my birthday celebration in September 2016.  The restaurant was very crowded but we did not have a long wait for seating.  Based on TV reviews, I ordered the Fried Salt and Pepper Dungeness Crab. It was absolutely delicious. Service was moderate.  Large groups got more attention than 2 guests (us), meaning it took longer for us to get served."

Very good Chinese restaurant on the edge of Chinatown.  Busy at 6pm so that tells the tale.  We had the black cod with chilli sauce. Highly recommend it.  Delicious.
"Food is really good, and it's worth the queue. Expect to queue for 20 minutes, it's worth the wait.  Service is excellent too."
"Let me add a little extra merit to this review by starting out mentioning that my wife is Chinese, and is a very good Asian cook herself.  The Chinese community in general knows R&G as one of the best Chinese restaurants in the country.  If you're Chinese and going to SF, you are probably going to go here at least once.

...And the food delivered.  Outstanding.  We ordered several dishes to share, all were hands down the best Chinese restaurant food I've had.  We also went for their salt and pepper (fried crab), which they are apparently famous for, and it was outstanding.   Seems kind of strange, since its the crab shell that is battered and fried, but it works nonetheless.  The spices were particularly amazing.  The crab meat was exceptionally tender as well.  I'm not usually a fan of eating crab out of the shell in a restaurant, but I'd make an exception here.

On the other hand, Chinese restaurants are not particularly known for great ambiance or service.  I wouldn't say the service was bad, but the biggest distraction from the experience was the table layout, of all things.  They just packed too many tables in there which didn't allow enough space between tables for people to navigate, including the servers.  Every time someone walked by we had to scoot in, which was exceptionally annoying.  Nearly every table in the room had that problem.

In summary:  If you like Chinese food, definitely go there (with a reservation), and be confident that you are at one of the best there is.  Don't be too put off by the bad table layout, just expect it going in."
We ate here our first night in S.F. and absolutely LOVED our meal! The restaurant is in the heart of bustling Chinatown but once you step inside the place feels calm and serene even though it's plenty busy! We had the prawns with honey almonds (a hands down our favorite) and almost ordered abscond one they were so good! We loved the roasted duck and salt & pepper spare ribs as well. Everything was cooked to perfection and we enjoyed a lie surely evening. They were ver busy but we never once felt rushed. Our waiter patiently answered every question and offered suggestions and feedback. We would highly recommend this place!
"From the outside this Michelian rated restaurant looks like any other Chinatown place. But the difference is soon discovered when your meal arrives. We walked from our Union Square hotel and we're looking for somthhg that would warm us up, they certainly did that at R & G Lounge. Our server presented us with a pot of hot black tea, we then followed with a serving of double boiled chicken soup that had an intense broth you could only describe as delicious. I ordered one of the house specialities the R & G Special Beef and I was very happy with my choice, so tender and with a secret sauce that no one knows the ingredients to. Highly recommend and worth the trip."
"Busy place and for a reason.  The food and atmosphere were exceptional.  Highly recommend the salmon and avocado egg rolls and beef with scallops, green beans, and macadamia nuts in black peppercorn sauce.  Absolutely scrumptious!"
The restaurant manager was extremely thoughtful and helpful with my order.  The pepper crab was delicious and good size - took me a while run with through the meat but it's a testament that the crab was worth the hard work.  The soup of the day (chicken soup) was delicious - definitely feel nutritious.
"Highly recommended by locals as the best Chinese in town, you're set up for disappointment. If you've had chili crab in Singapore, the crab here will not turn you on.
Good attentive service; expensive. Nothing wrong with the food; just probably the fact that it doesn't deserve all the hype."
Unbelievably good Dungeness Crab! Plenty to share. Full of flavor. Other Chinese dishes support the featured entree. Fried stuffed bean curd is creamy and light yet filling. Very professional and attentive service. Possibly the best Chinese restaurant in the Bay area. Highly recommended.
"I guess if you want to eat in an authentic Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, San Francisco its a good thing when among a good size crowd in the restaurant you are the only patrons who don't speak Chinese. Andrew Bourdain ate here a while back and raved about the Salt and Pepper Dungess crab, so it convinced us to try it out especially since it was so close to our hotel. We ordered that dish and split between the two of us. We noticed pretty much everyone else ordered it as well, but they ordered additional dishes which made me think how do they stay so fit and slim. Splitting it was enough for the two of us. We did split the baby bok choy and egg rolls. I will admit we didn't enjoy the Salt and Pepper crab as much as Andrew did primarily because its deep fried and for our taste buds deep frying a perfectly good crab detracts from the wonderful crab meat.  Service was attentive; knowing Cantonese would be helpful. We do recommend this restaurant, just wish we had stuck with the more traditional dishes which looked delicious."
"Much of the restaurant is downstairs, deceptive from the street.  Menu is extensive, interesting dishes.  We had Cubed beef Scallops and Macadamia nuts. Sauce was light and yummy. Dragon Phoenix (??) was very good, chicken cooked just right,  Appetizer Avocado Spring rolls was enough to share and remarkably good. Never have had that combination and I have eaten many times in NYC Chinatown.  Hot tea was plentiful and refilled.  Restaurant was busy even though we arrived at mid afternoon."
"This restaurant was recommended by a hotel conceirge and when we arrived was busy - which we took as a good sign.  Waited ages for a table - but then were seated at a table that at best could be described as being in a corridor.  Soulless lighting, noisy location and no atmosphere whatsoever. 

The waiter service was dreadful.  The food was inedible - and arrived in a random order - very slowly, some cold, some hot - all tasted revolting.      Soft drink arrived in a can - unopened!  Wine was like vinegar.  

If there had been a zero rating - it would get that for all - service, meal and value"
"I had to go and experience the Salt & Pepper Dungeness crab strongly recommended by TripAdvisor members and Fodor's 2016 travel guide.  It was very busy but the wait for this delicious  crab was absolutely worth it.  It was a delicious lightly battered crab with salt and pepper and not overcooked that easily could be shared among 3 to 4 adults plus an entree and appetizer.  The crab was $43.00 while Great Eastern was charging $52.95 for Dungeness crab.  I don't know how Great Eastern tastes but they do serve it multiple ways.  The other dish ""Three Treasures"" was too spicy hot for me and the portion was so small that I thought it was an appetizer. It came on one of those square dinner plates. For $18.00, it was too expensive. The seat people on the first floor, wood paneled walled basement and second floor. We sat near the live seafood tank downstairs in the  basement and found it entertaining to look at the fish, lobster  and shrimp swimming right next to us and then disappear as they were scooped up for someone's dinner."
"First off we were impressed by how clean the restaurant was. The staff was very efficient and friendly. We sat in the ground floor dining area, which is done somewhat modern, but there is an upstairs dining area with a more ethnic flair if you prefer. The menu is refreshingly non-typical, ie more authentic. The Sweet & Sticky rice was really different and good. All the food was great quality and served family style. I will make it a definite stop next time I'm in San Fran."
I have been to R&G Lounge several times. It is the best Chinese food we love the same and I will cuddle egg rolls the deeps salt and pepper fried crab and the noodles
"Super Chinese food in a restaurant that looks like it needs a makeover. Always crowded with tables in a packed basement where food is very tasty, very fast service but no ambiance."
"If I could give it a zero I would! My main came half an hour before my boyfriends, I'm STILL waiting for my rice! The manager couldn't give a toss. Don't go here service is appalling!!! $90 for the worst experience of my life!!!! Hope this stops the busyness of this restaurant!!!"
"Very good hot and sour soup, avocado egg rolls, scallops and snow peas and sake. Would not have eaten here based on name but was highly recommended by a tour guide. They were right - best Chinese I have had to date."
"I was completely overwhelmed by the number of great looking Chinese restaurants in SF Chinatown. Decided on R&G, but can't tell you why other than it looked impressive when I saw pics, and the reviews were all 4-5 out of 5 stars. Honestly, I think I saw Bourdain speak highly of it too. The most authentic Chinese I've been too. Got the H&S soup and the Moo Shoo pork. My wife is not a huge Chinese food fan, but she knew I was excited so she was a great sport. She got the chow mein noodles. Everything was excellent. The service was fast and efficient, and the servers all wore black suits with bow ties. Every customer besides my wife and I, and the table next to us, was Chinese, and this is out of around 50 tables. We also went around 2-3 pm too and it was packed. All pretty good signs that it is a great place. Price was very reasonable, and not any more or less than great Chinese in Atlanta, Tallahassee, and Jacksonville."
"My husband and I went to R & G last Saturday for lunch.  Although we had visited Chinatown in San Francisco several times before, this was my husband's first time eating in Chinatown.  I researched top 10 restaurants in Chinatown and came upon USA Today's review of their top picks.  We decided on R & G.  We walked right in at noon and was seated immediately.  My guess is though this place gets packed in a hurry.  There is limited seating downstairs and it was nearly full when we arrived so I guess we just got lucky.  We had salt and pepper calamari for an appetizer and it was cooked just right.  Not tough and chewy that you sometimes find when you have large pieces of calamari.  I had oxtail stew for the first time.  The oxtails were incredibly tender and the turnips added a beautiful down home Southern taste to me.  I truly enjoyed every bite of it.  My husband ordered the Mongolian Beef and the meat was so tender it almost melted in your mouth.  We had good service and we will definitely return the next time we are in San Francisco.  Go try them out!!"
"We had to wait for about 40 minutes for a table for two, but it was worth it. The food was very good but the place lacks any ambiance. It packs in diners at three levels and manages to keep humming."
"Went Abt 6.30pm on a Monday with no reservations . Waited Abt 30 mins at the bar for a table. the bar man was cute & friendly, and made good cocktails. So the wait didn't seem too long . 

Ordered the special signature cod which took 25 mins to bake , and prawns with walnuts , they were delicious, and double boiled chicken soup was a bit bitter. 

Service was average , and check came without asking , coz I guess they were trying to make tables for guests who were waiting . 

Dessert was a complimentary black bean soup which need to asked . 
Overall, without the bar man and the good food, I wouldn't walked 30 mins from my hotel to this place ."
"Little pricey.. $75w/tip for the at lunch time, and had nothing special. We were full though. Was pretty good food."
"We've been there after our tour guide has recommended the restaurant (actually, I really don't know why!).
The staff was unfriendly. I think they possibly only value Asian guests. 
The hot and sour soup was completely over-peppered (not too spicy, simply too much pepper; awful!).
We had roasted duck and noodles with shrimps as main meals. The duck consisted only of fat and bones, horrible to eat. No rice or anything else besides a honey-like dip.
The noodles were too fat, not really tasty. We would not recommend this restaurant at all."
Easy summary; excellent food was tempered by poor and unfriendly service. Still a worthwhile stop in Chinatown.
We ate at R&G for dinner at 5:00 pm. It was not crowded and meals were very good. Large portionsizes and fast service.
San Francisco's China town is very disappointing. Very drab and full of junk shops But then came R&G Lounge.  Not much from the street apart from a large crowd milling about outside waiting for tables. Same in the main lobby. No booking so you have to fight to get in by getting your name on the list. Huge crowd queuing but worth 45/60 min wait spent drinking at the bar. Fast and furious service from large manic staff and GREAT food. Every mouthful a delight. Don't plan to spend an evening there. We were out in just over one hour - but brilliant nonetheless.
"We never had a bad meal here.  If we have a very special occasion to celebrate, we come here because the food is so outstanding.  Whether you go on a weekend or week night, the place is crowded.  Because of that, the service may feel rushed sometimes because they need your table.  When you leave, there is generally crowds of people waiting.  Make reservations for sure."
"Excellent food! Long waiting time, but worth the wait . so I suggest call and make reservations. The deep fried crab is delish, first for me. Also it was featured by Anthony bourdain on his show of San Francisco."
"too crowded.  i was glad that i reserved.  
We ordered the banquet but they were very slow of serving.  expensive for little serving."
"Honestly, who are you going to listen to?  Me or Anthony Bourdain?  I am hoping your answer is me, but I am not betting money on that.  When R&G was on Bourdain's acclaimed show and he raved about the food, an already established restaurant soared.  If you don't mind eating in a very crowded basement (am I claustrophobic?), maybe this is your favorite place.  Frankly, as far as I am concerned, the Chinese restaurants in East LA blow away R&G.  But then, comparisons may not be fair.  I cannot say I know of a better Chinese restaurant in San Francisco.  I do know of many far better restaurants."
"We ate at R&G Lounge after looking on trip advisor because the restaurant we were going to go to was closed. We were not disappointed. It was great. It was packed and we had a 30 minute wait  but there is a bar to get a drink while you wait. Worth it!! The meal was delicious. We had the Salt and Pepper Calamari. It was a little salty, but still good. Soup was good. Honey walnut prawns were yummy. It other reviews we read people felt rushed. We did not experience that at all. The waiters were very friendly.  A great find."
"The doorman at our hotel recommended this place, and all who overheard his suggestion agreed. We didn't have reservations, so there was a short wait (in the bar, if desired). But the food was worth the wait! It was delicious and plentiful. The place was packed, but the service was good."
"Excellent restaurant at Chinatown, near Financial District, me and two friend asked for 3 plates: R&G Special Beef (5/5!), rice and pork, it was terrific! Must go if you around there! Excellent prices also!"
"Located in Chinatown, the inside is typical of Chinese restaurants with large round tables and kitch decoration. No problem. The food was really great, we had a large variety of dishes with beef, pork, vegetables (praised by our Chinese friends) and at the end, the top of the top with braised cod fish (sublime but expensive). Overall, a great experience."
"This place is a true gem. I ordered hot and sour soup, which was among the best I have ever had and which I always order. Also lived ma po tofu, it is listed as a dish with pork but they were happy to make it without as a veg dish. Heard about this place from a co-worker originally from china, and it totally lived up to it's reputation."
"The food was excellent.  The restaurant is located in the basement but it is a fun and crowded experience. We enjoyed the honey chicken, spareribs and fried rice.  We also ordered the salt and pepper crab which is a specialty (this is expensive but we were on vacation and heard that it was the best way to have crab).  You may need to make a reservation or go off peak hours."
"Went on the recommendation of the concierge in our hotel.   Most of the clientele is Chinese, and the seafood is swimming in tanks - two very good signs.   We had the signature salt and pepper crab and it was fantastic."
"Wonderful Cantonese food.  We waited about 45 minutes on a Thursday night, so plan accordingly.  We had hot and sour soup (solid), spare ribs (excellent), honey and garlic chicken (really really good), and the beef house special (ok, lacked flavor).  Service excellent!  So many items to try...would recommend for authentic Chinese food."
"Classic hustle and bustle. Hurry in and hurry out. Great bar tender, good food and a packed atmosphere. Felt like a VFW club but adds to the experience. Fried rice is the bomb.  I'd go back tomorrow."
"I have eaten here many times over the years. The food is very good. Service is poor. I always feel like they are pushing us to order expensive dishes. Service is rushed and as soon as you are finished they expect you to leave. I am an American who married into a Chinese family, I am quite familiar with the different style of service in Cantonese restaurants, which can actually have it's own kind of charm. This is something else. If you don't mind feeling that the staff are trying to extract the maximum money from you in the shortest period of time, you could enjoy your meal here, but there are other restaurants in SF with food just as good."
"We came here for lunch after spending the morning walking around chinatown. We ordered the sweet and sour soup and salmon avocado egg rolls as appetizers. I got fried tofu stuffed with shrimp and white rice for my lunch and my husband a chicken noodle soup. Both entries were OK, nothing extraordinary. My tofu came out first and it took us asking 3 times and 10 minutes to get my side of rice."
"Get here early unless you enjoy waiting in line to get in.  Busy but worth it. Great sea food, traditional Chinese.  Can be expensive, prepare yourself for meals $15 to $25 or more for some dishes.  Parking can be a challenge to find."
"I went to R and G Lounge for dinner and lunch on subsequent days.  I've been a long time frequently flyer, and I will continue to be.  The food is remarkable!  If you decide to go, realize that R and G Lounge is always crazy busy, and that it can be a challenge to get in.  Moreover, if you have reservations, the whole party must be there.  That being said, I always go early.  On a Saturday night, as a solo, I was seated at the bar, which was good.  Indeed, the best service I ever got at R and G was at the bar. Now to the food - go for the sea food and ignore the traditional Chinese - American dishes.  R and G knows sea food. The first night, I had the ling cod with ginger and scallions, which was perfectly cooked, delicately flavored, and just toothsome enough.  I have also had the back black cod - which is worth the price.  Its wonderfully rich yet mild, with a crusty rich covering.  The fish flakes to the touch in large satisfying pieces.  Finally, I had the gooey duck salt and pepper / sashimi  .  What a unique treat!  The salt and pepper prep was tinder, clammy in all the right ways, and crunchy.  The Sashimi was clean, briny and light.  The challenges of R and G is that the wait staff can be crabby at times (and wonderful others - hit and miss).  If there are, don't take it personally because it has nothing to do with you (usually).  There are are a lot of Chinese options in SF - R and G is among the best."
This was a very good Chinese restaurant I understand why Obama buy food here whenever he is in San Francisco the pork barbecue was delicious.
"Get here early unless you enjoy waiting in line to get in.  Busy but worth it. Great sea food, traditional Chinese.  Can be expensive, prepare yourself for meals $15 to $25 or more for some dishes.  Parking can be a challenge to find."
"R&G came highly recommended from several different people and guidebooks. We were so disappointed. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant and then ignored. No menus. No water. Nothing. People were seated after us and got food and still nothing. I finally had to ask for menus. Then they forgot to give us water. And they forgot to serve my husband his wine, which was $9 a glass and my husband said it was $5 a bottle wine. He knows wines. Then his meal was fatty and chewy and inedible and had a hair in it. It took forever to get them to bring the bill. The restaurant looks like a 1950s basement rec room. No ambiance. I would never recommend this place."
"A table was found quickly for us and whilst the food was great, the service was a bit strange! Our mains arrived before my husband's starter had arrived!!  Very apologetic and we got a free beer to make up.  The quality of the food and lively ambience made up for this which I'm sure is a one-off."
We've lived in the US for 5 years following a move from the UK.  That was far and away the best Chinese we have had in that time.  Every dish was awesome.  Great waiter service. Thanks.
"This is a higher-end Chinese restaurant in the area (white table cloths, large tables, etc), and the menu has many good options, some very authentic.  Black cod is excellent, I had a special that was in Thai Chili sauce and was outstanding.  We had a Dungeonous crab that was fried and very tasty.  Prices were fair ($18-25 for most dishes, MKT for crab was around $50), but charge extra for rice, etc.  Service is very Chinese (not friendly but adequately staffed for sure)."
This place was recommended by a friend visiting from LA and I had to try it out. I can safely say that I had one of the best experience of Chinese cuisine here in the heart of Chinatown. They offer an excellent array of seafood. Even the fried rice was very good. I could not try their famed fried crab this time but observed that was a popular order here. Will have that when I visit next time!
"This is a great place for families. Lots of locals eat here and it is less casual than the name implies. The food was good, service was good, and there is an extensive menu. The meal was rushed, however, making the night out less than we hoped. We felt pushed out even with drinks still on the table."
This score is based on food quality alone.  The black cod is the nicest fish dish I have eaten in years.  These people know how to treat ingredients.  It  was so good we returned he following day just to try othef dishes.  Expect to queue and anticipate a real chinese restaurant for the  local chinese community.  Truly exceptional.
"We went in a recommendation of a taxi driver. The restaurant does not look much,  but the food exceeded all expectations.

We started with seafood soup, which was the first hint that we are on to something special: it was to a seafood soup from your local Chinese what Maria Callas' 'mio babbino caro'  is to your humming in the shower. 

We then had special beef,  which was nice,  although nothing to write home about, followed by black cod that blew our taste buds and minds. Followed by clams in black bean sauce which tasted like they came out of the sea five minutes prior. 

All for less than $100. 

I don't know if the Obamas really eat there,  but if they don't,  they ought to."
"We read positive reviews on several sites regarding R&G Lounge and reserved a table for lunch today.  After checking in with the street level Maitre, we were promptly shown to the busy basement dining room where a table was cleared for us.  

The dining room itself is worn, dated, dingy and windowless.  The floor and table were sticky.  Most patrons clearly overlooked this, but my wife was not pleased at all.

Service was prompt but indifferent.

We tried the Peking Duck, Chicken Chow Mein and a steak dish.  

On a scale of 1 - 10 the duck was a 6..5.  The meat was bland.  The skin was crispy as it should be, but lacked the thin uniform layer of fat that the best Peking Ducks have.  A nice twist is that the restaurant provides thick open buns for the duck as opposed to pancakes.  

The Chow Mein was good, a solid 8.  And the steak was tasty but chewy.

Overall the food was Ok, but the dining room is an awful  place to enjoy a so-so meal and endure somewhat curt service."
"Apparently the Obamas eat here when in town, so we thought we would give it a try. So glad we did! Crazy busy, but we waited at the bar for a table. Waiter very helpful and made sure we didn't order four starters as two would be plenty. The main courses are HUGH! We were very hungry but couldn't eat it all. Good value, too. Highly recommend."
Valet at Hilton (Financial District) recommended this restaurant for Chinese cuisine.  Great food and atmosphere!
"If you want authentic Chinese (Cantonese) cuisine, this is the place! And it is crazy busy... They have a large selection of dishes at reasonable prices. Ordered a roll as an appetizer and their oysters with ginger & onions, and both were outstanding. Word of caution: we got there around 18:30, and already there was a small queue... but by the time we left around 19:30/20:00, the waiting room was packed and people were lined up outside on the sidewalk!"
"This was my wife's first experience in San Francisco and Chinatown.  We were recommended to R & G over the other more popular restaurants on the street.
We were pleasantly surprised how quickly we were give a seat and the fun began.
The food was good and the service was not typical american, but nice.
If you are an American couple who orders a separate meal...make note.  They will bring one plate of food for you to eat off of then bring the next meal once they notice the plate emptying out.  It frustrated my wife but as you looked around the restaurant you noticed that is how the food is served."
Definitely get Peking Duck.  The little white puffs of bread that come with it only enhance the experience even more. The eggplant is also good but if you want it mild make sure that your server knows that you really mean it. This is an authentic place to go. You will see many families there enjoying the food and each other company. You cannot help but be part of the energetic and positive atmosphere.
"My family and I recently visited San Francisco for the first time. My one wish was to visit and eat dinner in Chinatown. Our town guide told us that the President eats at this restaurant so we thought we would try it. When we arrived, we were seated right away downstairs. It was crowded with other diners but not overly noisy. Our waiter was Wayne and he was very helpful and friendly. When I ordered the lemon chicken, he told us that it is his favorite. We ordered three entrees and an appetizer. My daughter can be very picky about her Chinese food but she loved everything. Very good experience at this restaurant!"
"Make a reservation before you go to R & G Lounge or expect a long wait.  We had a large party and were seated upstairs.  I definitely recommend the salt & pepper crab, special beef, and the baked black cod.  Great food at reasonable prices."
"This restaurant is known for its Crab. Um, deep fried in salt is NOT better than Ginger/Scallion and Black bean. Lines out the door? Way better places and way better service. Their special beef dish is like hot beef jerky in a bad way. The Wonton Soup tasted like a bowl of salt. The 'Chow Mein"" was bland and had no veggies. Fried shrimp? Meh. I've had better delivery.  Really disappointed to be told to eat here and knowing the president's taste in food. I suspect he was just as upset. Hope his stomach wasn't."
"Recommended by the Concierge at the Ritz-Carlton and it did not disappoint at all. Decided to try the salt & pepper Dungeness crab, honey mayo walnut shrimp, fried rice, Peking Duck w white buns. Wow, it was great, best food we had! Easy to find - just down the street from the big Chinatown park. Enjoy! ..."
"We visited based on others ratings and were very disappointed. The atmosphere was marginal and the noise made it hard to talk, including crashing dishes as the waiters threw the dirty dishes on their trays. The service was terrible, we had to repeatedly flag waiters to get any attention. The chicken and corn soup tasted like it was from a can, the fried rice was bland at best, and the Peking Duck was among the worst we have had (greasy and more bone than meat). The skin was the only good part. I would be hard pressed to advise anyone to eat here."
"Super martinis, recommended by my tour guide. I had the shrimp & pineapple fried rice $12. I was able to eat at the bar which I prefer if I'm on my own. Lovely staff - great service. Will be back!"
"Never go wrong and is my annual visit to this restaurant. Being lunch or dinner, food was great. Pepper and salt crab, daily soup, roasted duck and meat, steam Spring chicken and many more are worth a try ."
"VG Chinese Food but Pricey! We ordered the staple Salt and Pepper crabs, honey walnut prawns , spicy green beans, spare ribs, HK noodles ..   not sure id go back though. There are a lot of other Chinese restaurants in the area that are just as good and not as expensive"
"Wow! We were walking around San Francisco's Chinatown, and really not sure where to eat. I asked one of the shop cashiers, where would she go to eat, and she said R&G's. We really lucked out, the food was fresh, tasty, and priced just right. We had the egg rolls as an appetizer, and they were light and crispy. We shared the prawns in xo sauce, and they were not too spicy, just enough. We had the roasted duck, that was crispy and so delicious. We also had the chow mien, which had a combination of seafood and pork in it, another tasty dish. We also had the special fried rice, which was white rice and mixed with shrimp, crab, and other veggies. Overall the service was excellent, and we got there just before the rush. We got in at 5:30, ate and at 6:15 it was packed and a big wait for tables. The bill for 3 with no alcohol with tip $95, not bad for a tourist area."
"Want a good Chinese food experience and did I pick the right place. Got a tip from a taxi driver and he was spot on. The place is very clean, service is awesome and the food was amazing! Great quality and huge selection. Best I have had since Hong Kong!"
"We went to this restaurant on the recommendation of some people that we met a few days earlier and went without a reservation. We were seated in the bar area and were able to have a couple of drinks whilst we waited for about 30 minutes for a table to come available. I do have to say that the cocktails were innovative and fantastic!

The restaurant was heaving and we had heard that this was a very popular spot, with even the Obamas eating here. However, sadly, it didn't live up to expectations. 

It could be that we chose the wrong food, albeit, I imagine the items ducks as duck pancakes and lemon chicken would be a staple somewhere like here. However, all of the food that we got was either very fatty (i.e. lumps of fat) or clearly had huge amounts of sugar and salt in, which made the food somewhat unpleasant to eat. 

Under normal circumstances, I would say that the food quality is what you would expect to get from a cheap corner takeout, locally. For the huge prices they charge and the reviews that they have, I would say that I was very disappointed with our dining experience. 

In addition to the above, we felt like we were in a cattle market in the end once we were seated. Service was sporadic and, when it was there, it was only for the purposes of moving us on as quickly as possible."
I was staying at the Hilton Financial District in Kearny Street and just down the street this restaurant.  I had the beef cubes sugar snaps and it was delicious.  It's busy and loud with people coming and going all the time but I didn't have to wait long to be served. It's expensive but you get hat you pay for.
"R & G Lounge came highly recommended by the Ritz Carlton concierge, as well as tripadvisor.  Those of you who are regular followers  of Anthony Bourdain’s series, ‘No Reservations’, may recognize this Chinatown establishment from Season 5.  Having dined here, it is easy to see why this restaurant entertains such esteemed accolades.  The food at the R & G Lounge is remarkably good and indelibly authentic- the crab and special beef are, particularly, fantastic.  Dishes are not heavily laden with soy sauce and contrasting flavors, as would be consistent with a romanticized Western hybrid of Chinese food.  Flavors are generally understated and rely on the quality of ingredients and preparation.  The food is what brings people here.  The service at R&GL is remarkably poor.  The spectrum of service ranges from inconsiderate to belligerent.  The host was overtly rude when we asked for specific accommodations, the waitstaff was in a rush to disband our dining experience and usher us out to prepare for the next service (we had a late lunch and the restaurant was entering a lag time so we were not holding customers up).  There was literally no attempt at synchronization.  My entrée arrived with the appetizer (our server had one dish in each hand), and there was a further twenty to forty minute spread from that point over which the remainder of our party members were served their main courses.  The most amusing part of the meal came when a misunderstanding led to our server bringing us an (extra) entrée that we did not order –rather than try to get to the bottom of the issue, he became uncomfortably aggressive with us that we had to pay for it.  I am unclear what kind of clientele this self-identified fine-dining establishment is used to, but in the interest of deescalating the scene the server created, I agreed to pay for the dish!   Somehow we got over the service hurdle to still give the restaurant a 4-star review, and this is testimony to the food.  As for the pricing, this restaurant is a bit on the pricey side but nothing unaffordable, with most of our lunch entrees (including the one we did not order), being priced at around $20.  Upstairs is a white tablecloth setting, which provides for a more formal environment for staff-members to discompose themselves in.  Overall, this is a good option if you are interested in good food and circumstances would allow you to overlook all else."
Very tasty food. Fast service and friendly. Crispy chicken and chicken black bean delicious. Prices reasonable and if you want fresh crab they got it. We walked around a few and this was great. Close to union square as well
Not a lot of shrimp but so delicious I can never finish it all in one sitting. Very filling. May want to order with a side of rice though since that doesn't come with it.
We drove from Santa Cruz and our hotel recommend this Cantonese lunch. The best spicy rice I have every had!!!. Chili prawns were fantastic.  Lunch special vegetable soup was crazy good.  Order spicy and extra hot. Can't go wrong on this spot.
"Lots of places to choose from, but went here on recommendation from tour guide. Very large place for Chinatown. We only had to wait about 7 mins even at 12:30. Lots of staff and very efficient. Large menu and food was good, though more American Chinese. Seemed to be a fair number of locals and lots of infants."
SO I like everyone else has heard how great this place is... well don't fall for the hype!!!!!!!!!!! There are a lot of great places to dine in Chinatown that offer the same items for half the price. The only reason i'm giving 3 stars is because the service was great which is hard to find in Chinatown .But the food was just ok and way over priced I mean who charges $2 for a small cup of steamed rice ....NO ONE the salt & pepper crab was good but beware there is no price and they charged us $48 for crab NEVER again will that happen there are other places that offer salt and pepper everything for more then half the price I will not be going back there .
Do yourself a favour and eat here. It is delicious and I could run out of synonyms describing the deliciousness. Be prepared for a meal that is well worth the hour you will wait.
"Had the salt and pepper crab and seafood fried rice. The crab was huge and lightly fried perfectly, seafood fried was great as well. The staff was a attentive and friendly."
"This is a very good, high quality, modern decor, Chinese restaurant. I had heard it was famous for  it's ""Salt & Pepper Crab"" and has great reviews so I booked for New Year's eve - personally, I would book for upstairs if you have the choice Anyway, I mentioned to the Chinese/American lady at the front desk of our hotel (The Argonaut - very good!) that we were planning to eat here on NYE and she told me it was her fathers favourite for the Salt & Pepper Crab - so I was rest assured. They certainly didn't let us down, the food generally was great, the service was good and the crab was awesome. Definitely worth visiting for a good Chinese meal (and we have great Chinese food in London, and I have travelled to Hong Kong and China - so I know what I am talking about)."
"We went to R&G Lounge as several people said it was the best Chinese food in Chinatown.  We wanted an authentic experience and we got it.  At first, we were mildly disappointed because it's clearly not in the heart of Chinatown.  But, once you enter R&G, you almost feel like you are in China.  It felt a bit like a fire trap as there are tons of tables in what appears to be a basement with a lot of people.  There is an upstairs so that experience could have been avoided I'm sure.  We did get our experience.  The food was amazing and that was fun.  Of course, we had to have there famous dungeness crab meal and we all agreed it was the worst thing we ordered (very breaded and oily).  Everything else was amazing.  We ordered mostly the specials and what the waiter recommended and we are all very happy.  I also felt that the value for the dollar was excellent.  It was all good."
"Lunch meal at R&G. Not too crowded about 11:30 on a weekday but was by the time we left. We had fried rice (fair), crispy noodles with chicken (good), veggie egg rolls (standard), hot tea (good) and honey garlic chicken (very yummy!). Service was the main issue as all the food came except my honey garlic chicken. Everyone was finished (sad face) by the time I received it (but it was very tasty & hot upon arrival). Appeared many locals eating here. The free parking validation in Portsmouth (sp?) garage was only for table bills over $50 per our waiter."
"Concierge sent us here from Le Meridian.  Food was alright.  Service was alright....the service took forever.  It seemed like noone wanted to wait on us.  We ordered 5 meals and all shared with a neat Lazy Susan in the center and also got two appetizers.  We would have enjoyed it better with better service.  You can tell it is a local favorite, especially for the Chinese in China Town.  It was alright, but nothing special enough to warrant the bill due.  Will not return, would go try somewhere else."
"I was looking more for traditional Cantonese Szechuan dishes. The food wasn't bad, but was not as good as you would expect for being china town. Not my first ten choices for Chinese."
We asked the locals in China Town where we should eat and they all suggested this place. Very busy restaurant. The food was average.
"Our hotel recommended this facility as well as a friend of my husbands.  So we decided this was a must go to facility. We were so  happy with the service and the taste of the food. My husband had the Mongolian Beef and I had the R& G Speciality Beef.  Fantastic!  I really wish I would have tried the soft shell crab that they are known for, especially after watching it come out to be served to other tables.  Overall this is a great place to go to in San Fran for Chinese food."
Our hotel recommended R&G. Excellent choice. Salt and pepper crab was the best. Lots of authentic Chinese dishes. We arrived a little early- 6 pm. Restaurant fills up quickly. Be sure to stop by!!
This place was recommended by our hop on hop off bus guide - not least because President Obama eats here! We hadn't booked but arrived just before 6.00 p.m. Just as well as although we got a table easily there were big queues shortly after. The food was delicious and we had a very helpful waiter. We did feel slightly rushed ( although maybe it was just very efficient service) . If the feeling was right it's not surprising given the number of people waiting. For starters and mains for two with a glass of decent wine each and tip the cost was about 75$. Very good value for money.
"Considering all I was told about this place, certainly it did not meet my very very high expectations!! The fried king crab tasted good but was impossibly greasy and had very little meat. The pecking duck was definitely not what I was told it would be!!"
"We did a 19-day trip closely following scenic Highway 1 from Imperial Beach just south of San Diego to San Francisco. It was our second night of 5 nights in SF at the tail end of our itinerary and we were really longing for some comfort food, that is, authentic Chinese food. We easily found free metered parking on Clay St. (after 6pm) and had to do a few shopping errands. (We needed to replace a luggage strap) The shop keeper recommended the R & G Lounge a few blocks away.  The place was jammed. There was a crowd of people that spilled out on to the sidewalk waiting for a table.  The wait was close to a half hour but really worth it.  R&G is classic Cantonese cuisine. If you like the flavor of curry, try the Singapore noodles.  Otherwise, try the Hong Kong style pan-fried noodles. My favorite is with chicken."
"This was the busiest restaurant I have ever been to. It certainly lacks ambiance and is incredibly loud, but the food makes up for everything! Lots of local Chinese families ate dinner here too - always a good sign!"
"We've been to much better chinese restaurants

Pekin duck has very little meat but a lot of grease

Fried rice was good but not great"
Apparently the first lady and her daughters patronise this place so I guess it's pretty hyped up. The restaurant was packed when we entered for dinner. The crab and beef was abolsutely great. It was pretty expensive so be prepared to dig a bigger hole in your pocket. Definitely not for budget travellers.
"I went to this restaurant at the recommendation of the concierge at the hotel. The food was very good, and the service good either.

They are known for their crab, but I had the black cod.  It was delicious.

I also had their R&G Signature Martini, which was delicious."
"We came here for lunch not knowing it was a Michelin star restaurant.
3 of us had a soup each.
We ordered steamed egg with clams , it was really smooth and fresh ( highly recommended )
Baked cod ( a signature dish) was not quite as smooth or oily as I had imagined and it was tough on the sides.
The vegetables with mock abalone was nothing to shout about too."
"This restaurant was recommended by the concierge at my hotel.  It was an excellent choice in that it was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. 

I was seated right away, and waited on immediately.   There are lots of choices on the menu with pictures.   They are well known for their crab, but I  ordered the black cod.  It was very good.  It was fried in a sweet and sour spicy sauce.  I also ordered a side of steamed rice.

Additionally, I tried their R&G Signature Martini.   It was delicious. 

I would certainly recommend this restaurant."
"We visited this restaurant, as we had read it had the best roast duck, what a disappointment, we ordered half a roast duck, which was very tough and greasy, ordered a spicy pork dish, which was edible, some noodles and some fried rice. No drinks, just water, total bill came to $70, what a rip off, it has to be one of the worst if not the worst Chinese meal I have ever had. Stay away, it's not even in a nice setting."
This place is listed as having the best crab in a Chinese restaurant in San Fran......it is!!! Great Cantonese in general but the crab was to die for. Good service. Great suggestions. Don't miss this place.
"Really enjoyed the food - authentic.  Long wait....line of people.  We got the clay pot seafood stew, which was good (although it had a lot of tofu).  The beef was incredible!  make reservations."
we shared the yummy crab and flavourful chinese dishes with our friends. really great tasting. we are regular guests who dine at R&G each time we visit SF. highly recommend.
Every time I'm back in San Francisco I make sure I eat in Chinatown. If you love Chinese food. Chinatown is the only place to eat.  This was my first time at this restaurant and it was fantastic. I would eat there again!
"Well we walked to the Restaraunt from our hotel which was about 20 minutes.  When we get there, people were everywhere!  There were people pouring out into the street..it looked to be at least 60-70 people waited by to be seated the Restaraunt was extremely crowded.  We waited 40 min for a table for 2.  Once seated service was very fast but food was just ok.  It was NOT spectacular at all.  The ambiance was over crowded and a little dirty.  It was like eating in a school cafeteria but alcohol was served.  We were there on a Friday night on Memorial Day weekend...again the food wasn't bad but it wasn't good enough for me to go through any of that again."
"We had early dinner at this restaurant. We ordered foods that have been recommended by people, including the crab. Unfortunately, the taste was not unusual. Of the dishes we had, I like tofu the most. The ambiance was not enticing. It was too squeezy and too busy for us to enjoy the foods. I know this place is one of the favorites but there are alternatives in Chinatown area that you should also consider before eventually choosing this place."
"Very good place not commercialized, just be aware if you like rice with your meal not many dishes come with it you have to order on the side."
"I found this place by pure chance and boy, do I consider myself lucky! The food was delicious and the service super friendly. I had the lamb with buns, for which I'd had happily licked the plate. The waiter was the nicest ever. He even taught me how to fill in the buns properly (yes, believe it or not, there's a wrong way to do it). And because I was solo, he gave me access to the wifi, so I could share with my friends and family all over the world what a great time I was having. 

I think this place is very reasonably priced, given the quality of the food and service you get. You might have to queue - I happily did for 40 minutes, alongside local Chinese patrons. But what a better sign that the place is good that having nationals from where the food is from waiting to be served?"
"Excellent food at this hidden gem. Very anonymous on the outside. Nice and homey on the inside. Easy to get a table, good service, meals arrive quickly.  Very reasonably priced."
"Food: Roast Duck noodle and BBQ Pork + Soy Sauce Chicken over rice
Price: $25 for 2 (lunch)
Service: Pretty good
Ambience: Not bad for a Chinese restaurant
Free gift: Umbrella (especially useful cos of El Niño)"
"I went to this place five years ago when I visited San Francisco. I ordered the ginger and garlic oyster, and they were so good! Five years later, they are still so good!"
"Apparently this is the place to go to for good authentic Chinese food. We tag along with our foodie friends and it very good. We had 10 dishes for our party of 10 and had hardly any leftovers. Personally, I could not say which was my favorite; the salt and pepper crab which is unique, steamed tofu which is authentic, honey spare ribs which is balanced, steamed sea bass which is buttery and unusual from a Chinese fare, succulent green vegetable with whole mushroom, chicken done my grandma's way...yum.....Regardless, i would recommend a visit. I would also recommendation a  reservation; they have bus-loads of patrons (literally) ...."
"We are not huge Chinese food lovers.  We were recommended to this restaurant by a tour guide, which made me more skeptical.  He then said that it had great approval from a food critic and the Obamas had gone there .... more reasons to avoid it as it is a tourist trap ....       but we went.   We were ushered to the basement ,,,  ugh.    Not too bad down there and restaurant full up....     servers pretty helpful ...  not overly friendly but ok.  They helped us find a dish ....   after telling them what we like and don't like . . .    and it was really good food.   Pleasantly surprised and would recommend.    Try them out.  And tell us what is upstairs if you get to go up there... :)"
"Our Uber driver recommended this place. It is a Restaurant in Chinatown and not what I would call a Lounge.  At least 80% of the patrons were Asian and I believe that that was a good indication that the food was more authentic and less Americanized.  Our waiter was happy to recommend dishes and was not bashful about steering us clear of things he felt unsuitable for a group of five Caucasians.  We all agreed we had an excellent meal and a culinary experience that is rare in the US.  Their headline dish is salt and pepper crab  which is a whole Dungeness crab battered and fried.  Anyone will find it delicious.  I also recommend the salmon spring rolls.  One of our group was experienced with authentic Chinese food and asked about steamed fish.  The waiter happily offered a whole steamed sea bass, impeccably fresh (as was all the seafood) and cooked perfectly.  The atmosphere is comfortable and informal but somewhat Spartan. The place is mainly about the food.  The also serve alcohol. If you are looking for familiar Americanized Szechuan Chinese there are other San Fran places you should try.  If you're game for a unique experience check this place out."
"We were recommended this place by a chef friend, and it was the best restaurant we went to all trip! The food was so fresh and delicious! Must get the R & G beef special - melt in your mouth! This has got to be a must do in Chinatown!"
We had dinner here and expected great things because the concierge at our hotel recommended it. It was ok though. The food was ok. My sister had marinaded beef which was lovely. They forgot a portion of boiled rice and it was hard to get the servers attention so we just let it go. It's a vey busy place so maybe we just got unlucky.
"Went to the downstairs dining room for lunch.  I had the house special beef dish served with rice.  Delicious.  Dining by myself, I was seated at t large round table with a few others also dining alone.  Service was professional and efficient.  Meal was priced fairly for lunch, under $10 before tip."
"Excellent food, prices are reasonable and pretty good service. The only reason I rated a 4 instead of a 5 is because you have to order rice as an additional dish. I don't recall having gone to any other Chinese restaurant where rice wasn't a part of the main dish."
"This place was recommended to us and we weren't disappointed. It was truly amazing - we had Duck with Dumplings, Pork, Beef, amazing fried rice - it was all amazing 
It was a little walk for us but well worth it - a must for anyone who loves Chinese
We arrived & there was a queue & were told it would be 15 mins - only took 8mins & we were seated & service was quick & cheerful 👍"
"We made a 5 pm reservation for 5 people. 3 of us were there early. First they made us to wait until 5 (although tables were available), then they made us to wait until all parties arrive (which was never made clear to us during reservation, nor after we arrived). Then they just simply ignored us, even the hostess was talking to he manager about our situation, they never even looked at us and just simply ignored us. It was so rude that we just walked out after waiting for 45 minutes."
Had the 1/2 roasted duck..............Excellent and my wife had the mixed seafood and pea-pods. All excellent choices. Service was quick and efficient. Make a reservation for sure!
"We were staying at Hilton on Kearny. Our concierge recommended this restaurant as my hubbie can walk about a block. We had reservations which was a good thing since it was a Friday night and the place was packed. They have 3 levels of dining. We ate on the ground floor which is a little noisy and crowded but we had asked for that since he can't walk stairs. Food was good-not great but good. Chow mein was lukewarm when served but the chicken dish was hot and good. Hubbie liked the egg drop soup. If we were staying at the Hilton again, we would return to this restaurant."
"Was very clean, waiter was very helpful and made some great suggestions. Food was great, price was ok, very nice food in chinatown. The salt and pepper crab is the house speciality and had I to do it over again I would have had it, should have had it to begin with. I would for sure go again."
"My husband went there last night after reading about it on Google. When we got there around 7:30pm there was a huge queue at the entrance, approx 30min wait. I don't mean to discriminate but most of the patrons were Caucasian therefore I kind of expected the meal to be more catered for the Western palate. When I went inside I was totally astonished to find the decor to be so 90s. I can't imagine Chinese restaurants back in Sydney are able to get away with this but then the entire Chinatown in SF is very 90s and dated. The service was just standard, the usual Chinese 'I don't really care' attitude. Funny how that doesn't change no matter which continent you are on :) 

We ordered 3 dishes that were recommended on online blogs - golden fried rice, prawns with walnut & beef with scallops. The fried rice was food stall standard no wok 'qi 气' at all. The prawn & walnut was okay, give it a 6.5/10, nothing I couldn't have made myself at home. The beef and scallop was probably the best dish. I'd give it 8/10 - higher mark attributed to the large/fresh scallops used but lower mark for the amount of meat tenderizer and baking soda used on the beef. 
Bill came to close to $50 and then gratuity on top. 

Note: My husband and I are of Chinese background, I'm also a mean cook and we are also from Sydney where I've concluded has the best Chinese food outside of Asia. We're also seasoned travellers."
great chinese food in chinatown.  Loved the roast duck---must try in this restaurant.  Thier signature beef was so so but everything we ordered was great.  Must try if your craving chinese cuisine
"My family was on a visit in San Francisco and after indulging on all the cuisines we don't have in manila , we needed some rice back and some Chinese food . 

Highly recommended by a dear friend who loves to eat , this place does not disappoint . Best walnut shrimp I've tried in my life. Big succulent crisp shrimps with walnuts caramel odes perfectly . Their salt and pepper crab was also soooo good. 

Must visit . Call for reservations as the place gets quite full."
"Recommend from the tour bus guide- also a foodie.  While the decor and atmosphere is not as good as the food, I would highly recommend. The sweet and sour soup was something special with favors that continued after each spoon.   I am not sure how they mixed the complex favors in the main dishes.  all other Chinese food will not even compare from on out.  Just go!"
"Ate here tonight on the recommendation of our tour guide, Anton, from Urban Trek. Close to our hotel, Hilton financial district. Great food and really special lychee martinis! Make reservations."
We loved the R&G Lounge. We went here on recommendation from our hotel guest service agents. You have to try the R&G special beef. The prices are a little on the higher side but so is everything else in San Fran!
"I loved the fried crabs.  Meaty and very nicely done!  I also loved their salt and pepper scallops.  My only regret was not being able to try their cod dish due to long preparation time. Their other dishes tasted pretty standard.  

What I liked about our order taker was that he suggested that we had enough order in the list.   So we ended up practically finishing everything on the plate and satisfied.  :)

I'm starting to imagine the crab dish already as I write this review.  Will definitely go back.  Yumm!"
"The food was not edible at all. I have no idea how special many people have given this place positive reviews.  The food had no flavor and the appearance was even worse. We ordered chicken and broccoli and a noodle dish, I believe chow mein. The chicken was cut up into cubes and tasted like rubber and had only a coating of sauce. The chow mein looked and tasted like something you could make at home. It seemed like they just threw the dishes together."
"San Francisco, Chinatown, We must say, this is one of the best for Chinese food.
R & G LOUNGE, This restaurant is so busy we strongly suggest  RESERVATIONS!!! If not, the wait can be long.
But the food is so good, and surprisingly enough not too expensive. $ - $$. The Lounge has a full bar and soft drinks.
The menu is a variety of Chinese food from various regions of China, The atmosphere is a little noisy and busy, but your there to eat.
The restaurant is just one block from The Hilton Hotel Financial District, on the east end of Chinatown.
We highly recommend the R & G Lounge, The next time your hungry for Chinese and your visiting San Francisco, you must try the restaurant...
On our next trip to San Francisco, The R & G Lounge for dinner is one place you might see us enjoying ourselves;
Chinatown is full of restaurants, and walking around and shopping, you will not be disappointed.
Till Later;       Happy Traveling & Be Safe

"We had a banquet style dinner with two tables and almost 20 friends.  A casual dining experience and somewhat noisy.  I think we had 9 courses of dining excellence.  Every dish was flavored to perfection and the fish, duck, and vegetables were as fresh as can be.  The Salted Crab was simply outstanding.  Dried scallop stir fry was perfect.  The scallops were perfectly cooked.  The duck with buns was simple but very tasty.  The glazed seabass was a unique taste for me and perfectly seasoned.  The seabass was fresh and perfectly cooked.  Finished with spicy fried rice and sweet bean soup.  There is always a crowd but the quality of the food is worth the wait."
"Recommended by two people during our vacation so decided to try it out. Resaurant was busy so had a 20 minute wait but no problem. Now the food...house beef, delicious, salt and pepper ribs, mouthwatering, snow pea tips (not on the menu) fresh and wanted more.

Service was friendly and speedy. Waiter even told us that we had probaly ordered too much which was a first."
"On a recommendation from our tour guide, this was the best place to eat when in Chinatown.  With all the Chinese restaurants in the area, there is nothing on the outside that makes this one stand out, but the food is very good.  My wife's order was not correct when it was placed in front of her, but that was quickly fixed.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
"I have eaten at R & G several times and I love it, every single time.  My husband isn't crazy about it, but let me tell you, it is my favorite restaurant in Chinatown.  I even had my birthday party there.  Nice cocktails and the honey ribs are so very, very good.  I'm not the only one that loves it.  President Obama eats here when he comes to town and there is a very cute picture of him on the 2nd floor.  My guess is my husband feels like the place is a little pricey for what you get.  I think the atmosphere, the weekend vibe, and the sweet bartenders make this restaurant one of San Francisco's treasures."
"I would never have gone here if it hadn't been recommended by several people- very unassuming on the exterior & I think of a lounge as not being a restaurant. But it sure is! Lots of locals & Chinese eating here, you could tell. Tons of food, like most Chinese restaurants. We were seated next to the tank of all sorts of critters! Some things we liked more than others, but it was definately an authentic experience!"
"Not sure we'd have ventured in without the recommendation - nothing negative - just no 'draw'.  But we were glad we did.

Dining room is downstairs with decent-sized tables and comfortable chairs.  Waitstaff courteous and attentive.  

As most restaurants in CA, water is not automatic - you need to ask.  The horrific drought the state has been under for the past few years makes every drop precious.  

Menu is extensive - and specifies ""Spicy"" on the dishes that are.  

Pam selected Beef with Chinese Vegetables (which was bok choy) - and pronounced very tasty.  Rice is not included, although it was offered (based on another review, it may be extra).  I had the half Peking Duck, skin crispy and tasty.  I'd only had steamed buns filled with pork (steamed buns come with the duck) and must admit that these were like eating cute little pillows and rather plain, but complemented the duck.  

Restroom was clean and smelled nice."
"This is my families third trip to the R & G Lounge (a real misnomer of a name by the way) and with each visit it has gotten worse and worse. We simply won't be back after this time. We've had an assortment of food over the years here and we've stuck mostly to the ""House"" specialties. Add in rice and that's it! About the rice: It's not possible to be more bland and tasteless. Same for the House dishes. As for $: Forget it. 4 Star prices in a 2 star restaurant living on it's laurels. There simply has to be better Chinese food than this in Chinatown."
"This place is very clean and crowded.  It took almost 30 minutes to get a table on a Thursday night.  The hot and sour soup was absolutely the best I have had in my life and that is saying a lot.  We had the salt and pepper crab (as did many others) and the Mongolian beef.  The fried crab was not as seasoned as I like and a bit greasy but very tasty.  The Mongolian beef was amazing. Mine was not like any I have had.  It was a bit spicy with red peppers and some vegetables.  Although this place was expensive for Chinese, it is still tops in my book now."
"This place was recommended by Anita' jewelry.   Yes is a clean place,  which makes me feel confortable.   We tastes very good.   Just little portions.   Steam rice is extra. No water just hot tea."
"This place was quite the treat!  While in Chinatown with a party of close to 50, we came in and they made room for us upstairs; suggesting a group (portion) order from their menu to get our orders in more quickly.  We made our selections and enjoyed serving after serving of everything from their hot and sour soup, scrumptious prawns with honey walnuts, eggplant with garlic sauce, mu shu pork and chow mein.  All of the food was delicious and the pork fried rice at the end was definitely the cherry on top.  Amazing food."
Mediocre overpriced food. Good luck getting the waiter to acknowledge you. Water was finally brought to us after our meal was done and not by our waiter. The atmosphere felt crowded as if we were on top of the next table. Menu was huge which is never a good thing. Ranges from 15 bucks to well over 100 dollars. The upstairs was hot with little ventilation. Will not be going back to this overrated restaurant.
R&G Lounge has a great bar scene on the first floor - excellent lichee martinis!  Dining room is upstairs - they have great seafood.
"Every meal I've had at the R&G Lounge has been consistent.  As in very good and consistent. A comfortable atmosphere, helpful service and some of the best crab preparations I've had in Chinese restaurants.

Their downstairs dining room is cozy and feels just right to enjoy a scrumptious Chinese meal of any seafood dish, soup, vegetable or casserole dish.

I liked the food, I liked the place."
"I've heard this is often recommended by hotels, we went because of ta, food was excellent. Waited around 15 mins for a table on a Thursday night. Lots of Chinese people which is always reassuring! Had egg rolls (spring rolls), Peking duck, salt and pepper squid with a side of rice, between two. All lovely; could have done with a knife for the duck to help with the bones (we didn't ask, I'm sure they'd have given us one). Big portions. That and two drinks = $75 (without tip). Some of the nicest Chinese I've ever eaten, I definitely recommend it!"
"Had a wonderful meal here - one of the best hot and sour soups my husband ever had!  I had the shrimp with scrambled eggs, which I wasn't sure about, but it turned out to be one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had!  Our server was incredible and we had a great seat in the bottom level near the aquarium. Delish!"
"Salt and Pepper came highly rated and did not disappoint. One serving was good for 2 hungry people!  The Peking Duck was also excellent, best I have had in the US.  Only better in the orient.  This is a must stop for China Town in San Francisco."
"You must try deep fry crab!!!! We're very surprise the food.
Too bad we were only 3 adults and 1 kid, couldn't order more foods."
"Love to eat at the bar. Louie is always a pleasure to say hi to, grab a drink and have a great meal while discussing the day. Whenever I am in SF I find time to have dinner here. The crab special and the R&G Beef will always be good."
"While visiting our daughter in San Francisco we decided to do lunch in Chinatown and the R & G Lounge was recommended. We had a good experience. Food quality and service was good. The atmosphere is nothing fancy, just classic old time San Francisco."
I am treated in this restaurant with signature dishes of this restaurant. You cannot compare the quality with Hong Kong where Cantonese and Chinese food are very good. But locals will host lunch or dinner here.
"Love to eat at the bar. Louie is always a pleasure to say hi to, grab a drink and have a great meal while discussing the day. Whenever I am in SF I find time to have dinner here. The crab special and the R&G Beef will always be good."
"I went with a group of 5, we weren't sure if the meals were for sharing or individual.  We ended up with a nice selection that was great for sharing- each dish was interesting and tasty."
"We overhead a local recommend this largely authentic Chinese restaurant to a fellow traveller.  After stalking the chap for a couple of blocks we managed to nip in before the lines began to form.  There was a 30 minute wait when we left.  We had a variety of dishes, it felt very authentic and we enjoyed everything.  It was lovely to see the strong family community following this restaurant has.  Loved it!"
"Busy, very busy on a Thursday night, very, very loud and we felt as if we were being rushed to order, to eat and to leave.  This is not a restaurant for a leisurely meal.  However, all of the items that we ordered were well prepared, seemingly fresh and taste very good.  The quantity was also very good.  Would we go again, most likely no, but we would go for a take out order and enjoy the food in the silence and comfort of our hotel room.  Tip:  The spring rolls were very good and the lettuce wraps as well."
"We had been told this was the place to go, and because we had to wait an hour to get a table, I guess a lot of folks were told the same thing.  It may be true, but if so, you couldn't prove it by me.  What we ordered came in spurts:  the first two dishes came relatively soon, but the last dish came when we were almost finished with the first two.  The service was surly, which is something that often happens when a place thinks it is ""the best"".  All in all, we were a bit disappointed."
"Busiest Chinese restaurant ever, and for good reason. We had no reservations, people, almost all oriental, were spilling outside the door,onto the sidewalk and street, waiting for tables on a weeknight, but we were seated almost immediately in a back room filled with oriental business men and families, many of which were having the famous salt and pepper fried crabs. Extensive and interesting menu…try something different.  Scallops with beef and macadamia nuts and honey spare ribs, though not adventurous, were perfectly prepared. Recommended by our hotel concierge. We walked to the restaurant from Fisherman's Wharf."
"It was a Friday night and the R&G was busy, packed in fact. With a very extensive menu and many Asian clients we were anticipating some good Chinese in Chinatown. The food was good, the service and the atmosphere was hectic and anything but relaxing. In fact one soon got the overwhelming feeling that the management and staff's greatest desire was to have you gobble down your food as quickly as possible and get you out the door so they could get some more bums in your chair. Not an experience I would recommend."
"The ""bean curd with prawn on top was a joke"".  The scallops and beef with macadam nuts, good, fried prawns with flavor crystals good to.  Service not so good.  Told the wait would be 20 mintues, 40 mintues.  Waiter would not take our order.  15 mintues later another waiter took are order."
We were advised to eat here by an Asian friend who lives in San Francisco. We did not have or need reservations. The spicy shrimp special was very good. The black mushrooms and mustard leaves were delicious. Cannot wait to come again.
"With a reservation, we waited about 20 minutes before sitting down. The lobby was full of people which is a very positive sign of a satisfactory dinner. The quality and taste of dished served was the best I have ever seen in North America so have to write a review here to recommend and appreciate."
"My wife and I visited at lunch time and the place was very busy. We were asked if we wanted to share a table with other guests. We didn't mind so we agreed. The food was very good, no complaints whatsoever. However the service was very impersonal and the place appeared to have bad hygiene"
"This restaurant came recommended by local.  Upon arrival there was mass chaos.  it seemed that for some unknown reason the kitchen was closed, and some very unhappy people had been waiting for up to an hour for a table.  Shortly after we arrived, the kitchen opened up, and we were able to grab a table.  Not sure what to eat, we asked for suggestions from the waiter.  He only pointed out 2 things which we happily ordered...the special beef and the spicy prawn.  Both were acceptable, nothing special, but we were disappointed by the very small portions, and the very high price for the dishes.  Oh by the way, rice is NOT included, so make sure to order it separately (for an extra fee!"
Very busy place. We waited for a while and saw how Chinese customers where favoured with no waiting. The girl at the counter was rude and arrogant. I'm sure the food is great although some of the dishes we saw being served indicated a very poor cooking style. We moved to a closeby restaurant and we were seated immediately
"Don´t miss R&G Lounge, and DON´T miss the salt and pepper dungeoness crab, I´ve had crab all round the world, this is by far the best. Lychee martini is the perfect pairing. Walk in China Town afterwards, great couple of hours in San Francisco."
"Don't come all the way to Chinatown only to eat Kung Pao or some other Americanized version of Chinese food. 
This is the real deal. Reflective of some coastal areas in China. The live salt and pepper crab is to die for. They also have a beef dish that they're known for. Located across from the Hilton and below Grant St. 
One time here and you're a believer!"
"R&G Lounge is so popular that there is long line any time in a day. For two travelers (or for those two are not able to take out the rest), this place is overpriced and its dishes are always with large portion. Since we always ordered 3 dishes in a Chinese restaurant, we had the salt&pepper crabs, cod, and abalone mushroom with spinach. All of these three are heavy and kind of sweet, I have to continually drink tea. If we had one more person, these 3 dishes are just right. The food is fresh and cooked exactly for an appropriate duration. I would come again, when I had party of 4 or more."
"Business is too good that the staff acts like they are doing you a favor.  After >30 years of going there, I've had it with the new staff.  NO MORE!!"
I was here Superbowl Weekend with my kids to root on our Broncos as my boys love Chinese food and this is some of the best you will ever have. You must get the Salt and Pepper Crab that is a live Crab deep fried and the Sweet and Sour Chicken that is as good as it gets. The Fried Rice is also very good. They have good drinks and great bar atmosphere as they are always very accommodating even when they are busy. We like to visit here every time we come to San Francisco as it's a wonderful experience every time and the price is also very reasonable for high quality food in a big city. Keep doing what you are doing R & G and we will see you on our next trip to San Francisco! We need an R & G Lounge in Las Vegas!
"I have travelled the world and can honestly say this was the worst experience I have ever had when dining out. The restaurant was recommended to us and was very busy. We were seated straight away and ordered our food. One dish arrived but before what we had ordered for a starter. To be told ""kitchen very busy so all coming together"". Over the next 20mins dishes came out one by one with rice coming last, so everything already cold. We were told that this was Normal and ""Chinese style"". Yet every other table had their food brought out together. At this point the bill was thrown down on the table by the waiter with no offer of desserts etc. We left the money and it was taken from the table without word. Rude and completely uninterested in any feedback from genuinely frustrated diners."
"This place is alway consistent and delivers great food. The fried crab  , lemon chicken , bbq pork they kill it for sure. It's busy but usually not much of a Wait"
"Best Chinese restaurant in America.  
This is where the locals go when they want great authentic Chinese food.  

Nice place - not fancy, but nicer than those places with the horoscope placemats.  It's the food, though, that is the best in San Fran's China Town - which is the best China Town in the country.  

Try the blackened cod.  Melts in your mouth. Never thought I would have cod that's better than Chilean Sea Bass."
"I did not expect this to be good at all, I just need to grab some lunch in the Chinatown
to food came out quite decent, especially in the busy tourist attraction area
price is acceptable since this is at the heart of Chinatown
service is quite good"
"Nice food guaranteed. Proper restaurant. There are crabs, lobster n so on. No smile on waitress' face = authentic. (^^)"
Food is ok but not as good as expected.  Many dishes are on the bland side.  definitely overpriced.  OK but not great.
"Stayed at the Hilton nearby. Many restaurants in Chinatown but as it's so touristy safer to go with a well reviewed place.

Service was very friendly and food was ok but that's it. 

I didn't understand why the salt and pepper ribs tasted so sweet - not enough salt and not enough chilli and too much sugar.

The chicken chow mein had a tiny amount of chicken and a lot of noodles. The chicken that was present was quite rubbery, the cheapest you can buy no doubt. 

The Peking duck was moist and tasty, I did enjoy this dish.

Overall if you have time find a cheaper, more authentic place for Chinese food away from Chinatown. If not and you need easy and quick even with a slight price premium, this will probably do."
"This is the sort of place that people recommend, but when you walk up you wonder ""do I really want to eat here""?  I'm happy to report the answer is ""yes"". Despite the outward appearance and rather odd name of this restaurant, the food was wonderful. Our server was attentive and offered good recommendations from the very large menu. We tried a scallop special for our appetizer, which was delicious, and followed that with a noodle dish (also a special) and Peking duck. The soft bao-like buns with the duck were heavenly!  My friend has been stopping here every time he goes to San Francisco for  many years, and now I will too."
"We asked our hotel if they could recommend as Chinese resturant & the suggested here. We went on a Sunday evening early January & it was very busy. The greeting was not very warm or welcoming. We were told to go down stairs. Again it was abrupt & not particularly friendly but the service was prompt & efficient. We order salt & pepper prawns, honey ribs & a beef dish & they came piping hot & extremely tasty. Best Chinese we have ever had abroad. Ignore the lack of welcome the food is well worth it."
"We were looking for a place to have dinner nearby our hotel and the best reviewed restaurant was the R&G Lounge. The wait here was about 20-25 minutes but they have a nice bar so you can have a drink before dinner.
We were impressed especially with the seafood dishes.  We were not disappointed. Everything we tried was very tasty! Their speciality is the live crab, we chose the deep fried Dungeness crab  (48$) which was very good and  fun to eat."
"One of the great places my hubby took me to while on our trip to San Fran – was R & G Lounge (Chinese Food) in the heart of China Town. I, personally have never been here before... But the hubby did his homework and of course, did not disappoint. 
 
We were able to find parking (but I don’t recommend driving here), and skipped over to the restaurant. The wait was a good 45 minutes. The locals flock to this eatery like moths to a flame. I found it amusing how the hostess measures the non-locals and where she will place them - with an inspection from head to toe. If you are lounge “worthy”, then you’ll get a table there… but, if you’re not, into the basement you go! (Thankfully, we got the lounge!) 

Once at your table, your pushy server descends on you like a battering ram to a brick wall and expects you to have your order ready.. rush-rush.. no hmms and huhs.. Straight up. If you don’t know what you want… you’ll get castigated (ok, that’s too harsh of a word), but be ready to wait FOREVER… for a revisit from her. My advice? Look up the menu on your iPhone and have your order ready.  I hear the duck is the best in town!

As always, I’m curious about trying new dishes, at least once. So, I have been hearing about this magical concoction called “Birds Nest Soup”, so I ordered it along with the Braised Oxtail in Oyster Sauce. My hubby ordered the Cashew Chicken dish. Honestly? I don’t know what all the buzz is about on the Birds Nest Soup... the broth was gelatinously thick, with glass noodles (or the birds nest) swimming around in the bowl. The taste? Hmm.. how can I put this delicately? It was... oh yes, blah. Now, the Oxtail in Oyster Sauce was a different experience. It had been stewed to perfection! The tender meat was practically falling off the bone! I just about did everything but pick up the darn bones and gnaw on them! Yes, it was yummy! The Cashew Chicken was delish as well – as there was not a “peep” coming from the direction in front of me.  The sauce was light and buttery. Both dishes are served with a side of either steamed or fried rice. Many dishes are served a la cart – or family style to share.  

We learned from one of the locals that earlier that month, the First Lady and her daughters had stopped by, and closed the restaurant for a private visit. Not too shabby. 

Service could have been better (and friendlier). Attire is casual. Families welcomed. Credit cards are ok. Reservations? Yes – if you can make them. If not, be ready to wait - FOREVER. Parking… well, who drives in San Fran? But yes, there are a few lots locally. Where? 631 Kearny St., San Fran – China Town. Hours: 11a-9:30p. Prices? Most reasonable.. But for some reason, I get the feeling that if you’re a local – the prices are even better! LOL  -

"Located in China town , you will find some of the best food of any kind. Salt and Pepper Shrimp without shells is one of my all time favorite meals I have ever had. The chicken salad was great and not at all what you would expect of a chicken salad. Don't be fooled by reviews calling it a tourist trap, I have been to San Francisco 4 times and visited R&G's every time with nothing but the best experience every time ."
"We were looking for a place to have lunch in Chinatown in San Francisco and asked several of the local merchants.  They all recommended this restaurant at the corner of Kearny and Commercial St.  We were impressed with all the food we saw on the plates of those who were already dining, especially the seafood dishes, which are the restaurant's specialty.  We were not disappointed.  Everything we tried was awesome!  It's a good thing we had arrived before noon, because the place was packed with a lobby full of people waiting to be seated as we left.  This place would even be worth a long wait if you couldn't arrive early.  There is a bar upstairs from the restaurant, which is below street level."

"Ate there with three kids (8,11,14). Ordered only chicken plates because that's what we like best. Food was bland, needed to add salt to everything and even then, tasteless (chicken and cashew, Kung Pao, chow mein). Ordered a vegetarian dish ( mixed cooked vegetables) which was also bland, small and grossly overpriced. Eggrolls were good. Plates are very small compared to what you pay, order at least three main dishes for two people. Main dishes come with no rice, one tiny order of white steamed rice costs extra. Service was OK-so so.  Food  came very quickly and then they forgot about us, didn't even get close to ask for water refills or to bring forks and knives for those of us who prefer it over chopsticks. The restaurant was full of Chinese  people so I guess it's considered good original food, but in my opinion overpriced and food is bland and not to my taste."
Our family of two adults and two kids (on a two-week holiday in Orlando and San Francisco) ate here twice. We were impressed by the authenticity of the Chinese food. Highly recommended!
"I cannot wait to get back to this little hole in the wall place.  I was staying at the Ritz and this lady told me I had to try the salt and pepper crab.  She was actually visually giddy about it.  Okay, I am on a mission.  So my wife and I went there, and it looks like a total dive Chinese place with no one upstairs.  I'm thinking, that lady fooled me.  They took us downstairs and the place is absolutely packed...and this was for lunch.  We sat down next to some people that said they drove 3 hours to get here to eat because its that good.  We ordered the crab, and a bunch of other things and I must say it was GREAT.  The flavors were intense and when we were walking home I could still taste the flavors blowing up in my mouth.  A must when in SF, I am going back this weekend.hehehehehehe"
"Great food, great setting, fast service.  If you are looking for fresh, authentic, Chinese food this was the place that was the place that was recommended the most from several people in the area."
"My friends and I ended up here after a terrible experience at a dismal restaurant called Fang and eating here was the best choice we made, it was just what we wanted!  The food was superb and I would definitely recommend it.  The Pear Grey Goose cocktail also comes highly recommended.  It was very reasonably priced and the food was delicious.  Win win!"
Heard so much about the salt & pepper Dungeness crab available here. My friends who had been to San Francisco kept telling me that we must not miss it. So we went. It was delicious! Different from the butter or chilli Sri Lankan crabs we were used to eating back home in Singapore. There were fried rice and fried noodles which suited my kids very well.
"their special Mango martini is a game changer.  House Special Beef was amazing. Had a wonderful meal and our waiter, Andy, was great."
"I read at the ""wheretraveler.com"" San Francisco magazine a great review, but as I got to the place and asked for the menu, I was only handed a real poor list of dishes. None of them seemed very interesting, but I ended up ordering some shrimp with noodles. It tasted like something from very common to poorly seasoned, and there were just a few tiny shrimps. I ate about 25% of the meal. Then I noticed some people eating great looking dishes and asked the waiter what the deal was; to be answered that was their specialty menu (which I was not offered). From then on, I was really badly treated by both waiters and by the manager, who refused to serve me from the special menu! They told me I would have to try the place some other time! I left the place wondering why people were treated so differently in there... Maybe I look too much Latin American."
A great restaurant in the heart of Chinatown.  We didn't have the crab but the dishes we did have were excellent.  They did mess up our order twice - they brought us a dish we hadn't ordered and then another arrived when we'd finished the rest which was a shame and did spoil it rather.  It was full of Chinese which is always a good sign.  They were in a hurry for us to finish and pay and the reason became obvious - the staff then came in and ate their meal!  One rather odd thing we've experienced before - they tend to serve Jasmine Tea before the meal and seemed confused when we asked for it after as well!
"I've eaten in Hong Kong and Chinatown in London, but this is the best place I've eaten Chinese food by far!

I asked the hotel for a Chinese restaurant that was not Americanised and where Chinese people would eat, based on the food.

This place was recommended and it was heavenly.

We had the shrimp with walnuts which was fabulous. Salt and pepper calamari was tremendous too! Had a main dish of beef with scallops and green beans which was amazing and a shrimp dish with sweet peas.

I'm hungry again reminiscing about the food here, it was tremendous."
"Really traditional Chinese restaurant.

If you like crab they do a salt and pepper brown crab.. massive things that tables of 8+ share and seem to have fun fun fun! (speciality)

The rest of the food was very good.. not 5 star.. but good.

It was the right price.. great atmosphere and brilliant service!

I don't think you can go wrong!"
"A great dish that is both tasty and messy. Only ordered the half crab for lunch but the portion is enough to share for two.

Added some shrimp chow main as a side that was great. Lots of  noodles but only about 8 shrimp...but still with a visit... especially for the signature crab dish. 

You will not be disappointed!"
"For taste, I give it four stars without hesitation, even after a recent trip to China. Ingredients were fresh and for a Monday even the scallop dish was superb. Price was fairly reasonable. 
I would have given it higher rating but dishes were served one at a time too far in between. We needed to ask our waiter for items like hot tea refills, extra napkins and forks two or three times. Parking is also a problem like most places in downtown San Francisco."
"The restaurant is hopping, very busy. There may be a bit of a wait for a table but sit at the bar and have a drink ,it is worth. Once seated great service. All dishes were very good but their special beef dish was outstanding, tender, juicy, cooked to perfection. The fried rice (pork) was very different than anything I had tasted before, like in colour and crispy texture almost. It was delicious. Noticed that the restaurant was filled with mostly locals, always a good sign. Their are fancier Chinese restaurants in the city but the ones I have tried do not compare in food quality."
"This restaurant was suggested by a friend, and after reading many reviews on T.A. and Yelp I thought it was worth a try, especially for their Crab with Salt and Pepper and their Special Beef

The place was clean and nice, and the staff seemed very helpful.  We ordered the renowned crab, the Special Beef, a noodle dish with vegetables, and a Chicken in Ginger Sauce

The Crab with Salt was very very good, but at $48 I would have been surprised if it were anything else.  Then the beef arrived.  This was made from beef that  seems to have been tenderized, marinated in a honey sweetened soya  sauce, and deep fried.  It was  good but nothing out of the ordinary.  The  crispy noodles with vegetables came with a cornstarch thickened tasteless sauce  which one could get at any chop suey house.  Then the Ginger Chicken arrived.  Now that was bad.  A half a steamed chicken, undercooked, skin still on, and covered in a tasteless gelatinous starchy sauce with bits of scallions and ginger.  It was practically inedible.   I complained to the waiter that it was not acceptable, and should be comped.  He said he would speak to someone, and then came back with the bill,, the chicken dish included.   I paid the bill, and when the waiter picked up the signed credit card he came back to the table and said I had forgotten the  tip.   I told him that they had forgotten to take the chicken dish off the tab.

My opinion:  If you want good Chinese food in S.F. think twice before going here."

"We were not smart enough to order the special family dinner on Sunday night and it was our loss.  Our food was great, but yu can't compare chicken & broccoli and shrimp & snow peas to the extravaganza that the chinese families knew to order.   Dish after dish of food piled high on platters -- lobster, salmon, shrimp, beef.   Each dish looking more amazing than the next.  The lin out the door is testament to the greatness.   Worth a trip to this legend -- it lives up to the name."
I wasn't expecting much but when i got the Walnut shrimp and the beef i was blown away. The food was great and the service was spot on.
"some friends of ours told us to try this place out. Couldn't order the black pepper crab like they suggested because of a shellfish allergy. Service was great, food came out fast. It was just ok, not bad but nothing special. We thought rather high priced for what you got, but it is San Francisco afterall."
"We arrived at this restaurant about 9pm on a Saturday after a recommendation from our hotel staff. It was extremely busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, which we were fine with. Once we were seated (down stairs) it took a long while for someone to take our drinks order, then a long while again for our food order. Although the food was nice it wasn't anything better then I get on take out at home, it was also pretty expensive. Don't think I would bother visiting again."
"Quick service.. great food..do not miss the miso covered baked cod.

Reservations highly recommended."
"We visited this place as a recommendation of some of the locals,I had the vegetarian egg rolls which were very good, my boyfriend had the specialty beef and said it was the best Chinese food he's had. The staff was very friendly and fast. We would definitely go back"
Excellent! No matter how many times I go to R&G it never fails to make my insides happy.  It is best to get an assortment of dishes and share with your dinner companions. The Peking duck is exceptional as no flat dry pancakes are served here to accompany it.  Instead you get puffs of white light bliss to fill with your duck meat and or skin. Everything I had I enjoyed. If you want authentic Chinese food this is the place to go.
"Authentic Chinese food in the heart of China Town. 

Definitely check out the Three Treasures signature dish along with the signature beef dish with special spices. 

Anything you order will be great! Thanks Anthony Bourdain for turning me on to this gem!!!"
The restaurant was recommended by our House Car chauffeur from the Ritz Carlton Club.  His choice worked out perfect for us.  The dishes that we chose were very well prepared and very authentic.   The fact that we were having a late dinner may have contributed to the dishes being that much more tasty.  Our Chinese restaurants in Vancouver are certainly highly regarded in the world.  This restaurant's dishes would be able to compete as far as taste but not as far as the pricing.  Our similar dishes are cheaper without even factoring in our poor exchange rate.  I would recommend the food if the price works for you.
"This place was highly recommended by a friend in Maryland.  When visiting San Francisco, we dropped by and ordered Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab, Teriyaki smoked Salmon and other entree which is excellent and delicious beyond description. Food portion is good enough. Service is quick.
Don't forget to try this restaurant when you are in San Francisco.
You will have to come in early for lunch or the lines would be very long."
"Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab is definitely the highlight of the meal. It is simply delicious. The rest is average. The baked black cod takes 30 minutes to prepared, very tender and tasty but a bit too sweet for our liking. Both come as large serving, need to ask for small serving. Honey spare ribs tasty and tender but rather disappointed with the Sautéed Prawn in XO sauce. House Chow Mein is definitely something you want to give it a miss!"
"It's busy here and you should definitely book a table, we did but still waited. The bar area is very sociable. Staff are friendly and the cocktails help to pass the time. Service is very quick once seated (seems to be a USA thing) Menu is interesting and tempting Food is fresh, tasty and authentic, portion size is good."
"Stopped in after a walking tour of Chinatown.  We were seated quickly and the food was excellent!  With so many choices in Chinatown, we stumbled upon a great resturant!"
"Shall I start with the Salt and Pepper Dungeness Crab?  OMG.  You have to taste this at least once in your lifetime!  It is simply to die for.  Other items on the menu are also noteworthy--pick another entree that's lighter and definitely to share as you will be full.  We try something new each visit, but will Never Ever give up the crab!!!  Tsing Tao beer is an appropriate beverage to wash down the fab flavors.  We find it odd that the restaurant charges for white rice, but who needs it with all the other delights?  Clientele is mostly Asian which speaks highly for our ""find"".  A walk exploring Chinatown afterwards takes away some of the guilt of such pleasant gluttony!  It doesn't hurt to make a reservation altho their system is somewhat fluid."
"We come here often for lunch when visiting Chinatown.  They have a very good lunch menu and ""over rice"" dishes at reasonable prices.  We often order the flat noodles, or beef stew over rice or their beef noodles soup.  You can walk in without reservations as long as you come in before the lunch crowd.  The reception is at ground level and the dining areas are at the lower level or the upper level.  The place is clean and well-kept and service staff are very helpful."
"Stopped in after a walking tour of Chinatown.  We were seated quickly and the food was excellent!  With so many choices in Chinatown, we stumbled upon a great resturant!"
"Shared a half duck and a glass of pinot. Perfunctory service, novel puffy pancakes for peking duck. Good crispy duck, all up $50."
Special beef is not to be missed but it is all good. Fast and attentive service. The best Chinese food I have ever eaten. Look around and see who is eating here - the local Chinese population.
My husband and I had lunch at R & G today. The food and service were both excellent. My husband ordered from the lunch menu and I ordered Three Treasures from the regular menu. Portions were generous.
"We dinned here twice on our weeks holiday - which speaks for itself. 

Three of our taxi drives all independently recommended this restaurant to us!

You need to book a table but even then you may have to wait a little. We took that as a good thing they were so busy.

The place was packed on both occasions - with local people. 

Garlic Chicken and Beef Chow Main were our favourites :-)

Definitely worth a visit!!!"
"This is a very nice, albeit semi-casual, Hong Kong fare restaurant in San Francisco Chinatown with traditional polished ambiance and service. They have a broad menu of fine dishes and highly recommended if you plan to eat in Chinatown. Their signature seasoned beef dish is excellent!"
This Chinese restaurant was recommended to us. Food was lovely. Selection of dishes large. The signature dish is crab but this was a little expensive for just two of us. Restaurant was very busy and predominantly with Chinese patrons which was reassuring. Service was quick but it was obvious you were not expected to take your time.
"These reviews on TripAdvisor and other places had built my expectations up too high I guess as I was expecting something really sensational from the food here but it was just OK.
I ordered half a salt and pepper crab, plain boiled rice and as I wanted a vegetable to go with the food, spinach with garlic. I had to ask for the spinach twice after the rest of food had arrived, the waiter seemed to think it was odd that I wanted the spinach at the same time as the crab and rice, he said they usually serve the crab first. I was surprised he would think I would want to eat a plate full of spinach by itself.
That was not a big deal, but although the food was perfectly OK, quite nice really, I did not feel it was anything exceptional and had been expecting something amazing. If you do not have the unrealistic expectations I had you will find this a perfectly OK Chinese restaurant."
"If you will eat at China town that place fabulous. It is like the Chinese restaurants in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The salt'n peper crab was great, noodles were perfect, prawns with honey walnut 😘👍👍"
"Been here in the past, and as mentioned in prior reviews, it gets very busy after the dinner crowd starts arriving. Be sure and make a reservation if at all possible. Food is great and prepared with what is obviously fresh fare. I will definitely be back!"
"We asked a local asian lady what restaurant she would recommend for us seeing there are just so many in china town and so we cane here. The food was the best, and good portion sizes that just hit the spot. Would definitely come back again."
"Don't expect good services at this restaurant, the staff looks tired and inattentive. We ordered the prawns with honeyed walnuts and the aubrrgine. The prawns or shrimps with honeyed walnuts was a dish to remember, the aubergine were good but I have tasted them better in another country. The price were alright but service needs improvement."
I love their ribs. Real Asian food not american version. Food that taste like home cooking. Great place to bring family and friends.
"We had seen this restaurant on TA and other sites had mentioned this was one of the best places to eat in Chinatown so decided to see if we could get a table. We arrived at 8:10pm on a Thursday night and people were queuing both outside and in - you get a ticket from the desk and wait - we were told 30 mins so went for a walk for 20 mins and came back and were shown straight to our table. It's much larger than you think in the restaurant downstairs and took it really positively that it was full of mostly Asian faces.

The menu was easy to follow with photos of many of the dishes. Drinks arrived quickly then from then on as we were expecting the food arrived when it was ready rather than being co-ordinated. 

To start my wife had the satay skewers and me the salmon and avocado spring rolls - both were poor in our view - just lacked flavour and the spring rolls were really small.

Our fried rice arrived first and sat for 5 mins without a warmer plate before my wife's beef dish arrived and then a further 5 mins for my crab so the rice was quite cold before we ate it.

The crab was good - nicely cooked and tasty though messy to eat! My wife didn't enjoy her beef with macadamia nuts as it really didn't have any sauce with it so was quite dry.

Overall we didn't really enjoy our meal and it came up short of the Chinese restaurants we eat at in the UK."
"I will preface this with the fact we are not be Chinese food eaters. Food was ok. R & G special beef and combo chow mein. Nothing we feel like we HAVE to go back and do again, but was worth a try after hearing the Obamas were big fans of this place. Came recommended by our tour guide. Service staff made us feel very rushed. Quick dining."
We had walnut shrimp  ( excellent ) roast duck ( excellent ) chicken chow mein (good ) and won ton soup ( ok) but overall middle of the week 2pm fast service very tasty . Get the shrimp and duck. Classic Chinese restaurant atmosphere.
recommended by hotel. best salt and pepper crab!  sweet delicious crab meat cooked perfectly! prompt service
"We haven't been here since 2007 and the standard now is just as good as before. It gets crowded very fast during after 6pm. We arrived a little before 6pm and didn't need to wait. The food is excellent as always. We had the beef brisket claypot and chine style BBQ pork (char siew pork), Service was fast, a little too fast, as we felt rushed to finished our meal. The space was limited and after 6:30pm, a line was forming outside. we got out at 6:35pm - our record time for dinner at a restaurant. If you want good Cantonese cuisine and don't mind paying a little more ($2 for a bowl of plain rice!) and eating quickly, this is the place for you."
"Places like this are disappearing. The  unpretentious postwar decor. Professional and courteous Asian service, with that touch of formality that I still like. Fine ingredients well prepared."
"We ordered Hot and Sour Soup, the combo appetizer with pork, duck and jelly fish. For the main course we ordered the Salt & Pepper Crab, and the Steamed Clams with Egg.

Total bill before tip was $108.20.

Holy cow, every bite was wonderful!  I could have gone back every day!  My favorite Chinese restaurant in San Francisco."
"Had a 20 min wait for a table, there was lots of people waiting out the door.
The food is very good so worth the wait, & reasonably priced, service was ok but they muddled our order up with table next to us. 
Would recommend this restaurant & will return when next in area."
Every time I visit San Francisco I go to R&Gs. One of my Asian co-workers first introduced me to R&Gs back in 2002and told me that many of the locals think it is one of the best and authentic Chinese restaurants (Hong Kong style) and she was right. I have ordered many items at R&G but one of my favorites is the Peking Duck. This is the only place I have had it served with soft dumplings instead of the usual rice paper and that makes the dish. Veggies are always market fresh as well as their seafood dishes. R&Gs has been consistently great for over 10 years. Not many restaurants can make that claim.
This place is such an amazing experience.  Boat loads of amazing food; family style.  The service staff is very attentive as well!
"Interesting and different menu, lot's of seafood, a real taste treat.  Modern and bustling atmosphere at the bar, good cocktails.  I was looking for a more traditional Chinese restaurant seeing it's Chinatown, but the food made the place.  Prices reasonable, bar seating if your traveling alone.  More formal restaurant upstairs."
"Although famous and crowded, R&G Lounge is still a great restaurant to visit in San Francisco Chinatown. They have a unique cooking style of dungeness crab. The dungeness crab there is pricy, but definitely worth it. 

Be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes during lunch or dinner hours."
We come from Toronto Canada . We have a thriving Chinese community  so we know & understand good Chinese food .The food  at R & G is mediocre.The pepper crab is deep fried & actually kind of weird . Avoid this place ..avoid the hype ..go to China town unless you want a tried & true tourist experience ... Not nice !
"Had dinner late evening. Nine of the queues others have experienced. Very friendly and attentive staff. Had a couple of the restaurant specials - beef and minced seafood in lettuce wraps. Very tasty. If you are looking for good quality Chinese in ""safe"" setting this is the pace for you. We visited a mom and pop Chinese in Chinatown the previous evening and food probably marginally better but it could have been a hit and miss experience. With R&G I expect you will get consistently good quality and more attentive waiting staff."
Came here for my Son's Wedding party after their wedding. The food is Fantastic! Fast service! The deep fried salt & pepper Crab is incredible! Always busy so a reservation is a must!
"This Chinese restaurant is mega popular & frequented by the Chinese community so that tells you something!! We did book a table but in spite of this we had to wait for 30 minutes extra, but we were in good company with up to other 20 people. This is a case of you having to be patient to get want you want.  When we did get seated it was downstairs & the hubbub/chatter noise was immense....but it didn't detract because it was part of the night's ""experience"". The food was very good & I will remember this evening for many years to come......if you are in a hurry or stressed out or have young children, then this may not be the place to come."
"Easy access on all kinds of transportation.
Huge parking lot nearby. You may check with your waitperson if you qualified for 2 hours free parking at the Portsmouth Square parking lot. Food is good and waiting for a table is long. Three levels of dining. Their signature salt and pepper baked crab is Michelin recommended. Wine and beer and bar service is available."
"We chanced a 6:00pm booking and virtually ran to get it. On the phone the girl tried to blow me off by saying she could not hear me, which I commented the same to the wife. Sure enough, when we arrived no booking, but I think it was the same girl on the front desk and we got a table thankfully. The rest was just great, r&g's special beef and special fried rice up there with the best. From what was an average start was a good finish."
"Ate here at the recommendation of our hotel....We are seasoned travelers and should have known better. Food was good, but not remarkable. Decor is dated and could use a better janitor...the Buddha on the 2nd floor looks like it hasn't been dusted since Reagan was President. If you want the best tasting Chinese cuisine, pass this one by for one of the smaller Mom & Pop storefront restaurants."
"My extended family dined here on the recommendation of a guidebook, after exploring Chinatown in the morning. We were seated immediately, though the restaurant was crowded. Most of us ordered from the lunch menu of rice plates, but a few dishes from the main menu were ordered as well I was happy with the food, it was about what I expected and it tasted good. My sister found it a bit ""authentic"" for her tastes, which to me isn't a bad thing at all. I loved the atmosphere. I did not love that the food did not come out all at once- two people were served and we waited an entire five to ten minutes for two more dishes, and then five minutes later the entire table had their food. This is a major pet peeve of mine, and it is no fun to either be the person with food, feeling guilty for eating or knowing your food is getting cold- or to be the hungry person wondering where your food might be. This made eating here stressful. This isn't fine dining, to be sure, but serving the whole table at once seems pretty basic to me. Still, once we all were fed we did enjoy our food. It was nothing mind-blowing, but it was tasty."
"Good food! Atmosphere ok just stopped in to try some apps. Everyone loved the food!!!
We were told about it by a Hilton bartender and he was right. Good and with the trip"
"This remains one of the outstanding Chinese restaurants in San Francisco that has maintained its quality. The menu is extensive. All the items are cooked well. The service, by tuxedoed waiters, is outstanding and friendly. 
    Lunch is crowded, so reservations are a must. You might get lucky and see an occasional national politico dining there, as they all seem to stop by for a meal."
We visited this restaurant tonight. Food is excellent and reasonably priced   It is a basic restaurant with no fuss. You may have to queue for a table as it is so popular. Sautéed prawns with snow peas was excellent
There was a 30min wait but that was fine for us. The food was universally agreed to be great from the chow mein to the hot and sour soup which was said to be the best she had. The salmon avacado roll was just as tasty.
"The R & G Lounge is an established Chinatown restaurant, and I was drawn there because it gets such good reviews for its signature dish: deep fried salt and pepper crab. I was set on having dungeness crab while I was in San Francisco.

However, the crab was quite a let down. The best I could say is that the batter was very crispy. It was not seasoned, and there was no lemon based sauce as is common with other salt and pepper seafood dishes I've had at other restaurants. Moreover, the crab meat in the legs was fine, but the meat from the body was mealy and whatever had been in the main part of the shell was completely cooked away. If it had been $20, that might have been acceptable, but not for $48.

We had the vegetarian goose, and it was also quite under seasoned. I have eaten variations on that called mock goose or mock duck, and they always had some kind of sauce. This was served cold and dry.

We enjoyed the mixed vegetables with mushrooms. The variety of veggies was a treat. However, it wasn't enough to rescue the other dishes."
A friend recommended this place for dinner and we were very happy with the food. My girlfriend and I had to wait more than an hour to get seated. The restaurant was very busy and the service suffered because there was so many customers to accommodate. We ordered the special beef and the kung pow chicken. The special beef was excellent and the kung pow chicken was good as well. The food tasted good but was slightly more expensive than typical Chinese food.
"This is a must try restaurant if you are visiting San Francisco.  Make your reservation as early as possible.  It's an award winning dining.  No kidding, their crabs are the best ever.  It's a rather small Chinese restaurant. Yet, excellent service ever.  You will in love with it.  It's the reason of why you want to visit San Francisco again and again."
"Dont be put off by the bad service remarks - this restaurant is about food - chinese and its fabulous, busy all the time with a wait time often of up to 45 mins - but do what we did take the opportunity for a little massage a few doors down - worked great - the staff are abrupt but if you want great service go elsewhere as this is grew food reasonably priced - everything on the menu is good but seek out their signature dishes especially the beef - fabulous - you will not find better chinese food anywhere in the world (and Ive looked)"
"We went on a walking tour of Chinatown and our guide recommended R & G Lounge to us. So glad that we took him up on his recommendation!!!! We enjoyed the egg rolls, house beef, and chow mein. Also recommend the watermelon juice--it was the first time I've tried anything like it and it was delicious. The service was very quick here and it made for a great experience in Chinatown!"
"It had been couple years since I was there last.  I remembered the food being good so we decided to go there for dinner on a Saturday night.

There was a lot of people outside but we were seated right away downstairs.  There were a lot of customers so one would think the food and the service should be good.  Not so this time.

We ordered 1/2 Peking duck $25, R&G special beef $20, Stuffed 3 treasures $18 (eggplants, peppers & tofu).  The waiter insisted we do not have enough food for 2 adults & 1 child and really pushing us to order one more dish which we politely declined.  Yes, there is enough food, just not very tasty food.  Skin of the Peking duck was not crispy, just fatty, which defeated the whole purpose of Peking duck.  The meat was not tasty either.  The beef was on the dry side and sure did not look like the picture on the menu.  The stuffed 3 treasures looked good but tasted blah.

For that kind of price, I expect better food & service.  I asked for ice water 3 times before getting anything to drink.  It was disappointing.  Now I really do not understand the line of people waiting outside."
"The best deep fried Dungeness crab ever! Great noodles, many staff running around on a Sunday noon. Very busy, line ups, recommend a reservation for sure. Huge menu, so many signature dishes."
"This restaurant was recommended by staff at the Hilton in the Financial District. The wait was very long, it appeared that Chinese customers who knew the hostess were let right in ahead of everyone else. The staff were cold, the service not at all pleasant. The courses were rushed. We waited for a table longer than we were able to sit at the table. The food was mediocre at best. Would not go back. there are many more wonderful restaurants in China Town to enjoy."
"We found R & G by walking around this part of SF Chinatown on  Sunday midday after fleeing from City View when they misrepresented our wait time. Two of our party of 5 had eaten b4 at R & G so we went in. We were happy we did. Everything was very good- the food (especially the salt n pepper crab which was divine),the service and the ambiance. Pricing was above average for Chinatown but not unreasonable. We'll be back:-)"
"Being on East Coast time we where hungry early compared to SF standards. At the hotels recommendation we headed here after a brief Chinatown visit. I feel as if we didn't grab ahold of our hurried waiter we would have been waiting longer to place our order. The place began to fill up fast with many locals who knew their way around the menu. When our food came, very quickly, we were presented with exquisite meals. 
Although not great on ambience, we highly recommend stopping here and enjoying a real Asian meal."
"Ask anyone who knows the financial district of SFO (who is Asian) and they will tell you about R&G Lounge.  A really good Asian restaurant (as so many are in SFO), but the crowds of Asians give you a good clue as to the quality of the food.  Ambiance - crowded, noisy and busy - what else! Nearby the Hilton hotel downtown, so a good place to walk out to get a wonderful (mainly Cantonese-style) dinner."
I absolutely loved the food here. It was steamy and fresh! The plates were a button the small side but it was great! Be sure to make reservations! This place is packed day and night. It's better to go early evening and not wait till the dinner hour. Will definitely go back when I visit.
"This was recommended by a tour guide but was a disappointment. We were seated quickly and had good service. The food was just okay. Not a lot of English descriptions. My daughter asked what is ""tender greens""? The waiter did pull up a picture on his phone but I still could not tell"
Lamb meat in bun was very good.  Pass on the beef and chicken satay.  Chinese restaurant with parking!  Nice atmosphere.
"I consider myself a sushi snob. I am very particular about where I will eat sushi, and even what days of the week. I had the fortune of being recommended to go to R and G and I am so thankful. It was unequivocally the BEST sushi I have ever had. We sat at the sushi bar and Jason took care of us. Each piece of fish was better than the last. The belly tuna was the best I have ever eaten!!  There are not enough stars to give this place"
"This restaurant came highly recommended, so the bar was set high. Having lived in Vancouver B.C. and currently living in Hong Kong I know great chinese food. I was disappointed with the tea, it tasted like red rose tea that you buy in Canada. The salt and pepper crap was ok, but I thought it was a little greasy. The crap itself was good. The fried rice was also oily. The green beans we good, the special beef was good too. Service was so so, had to ask three times to get my sprite, and when they brought it they gave me a can of 7 up. This restaurant would not be lined up if it was in Vancouver. I would not rush to go back, but rather try to find better Chinese restaurant."
"Service is okay. I checked in with the hostess and told her how many people were in our party and she failed to tell me to just go downstairs. The waiter was nice but service was kind of slow.  We ordered the chicken and corn soup, vegetable chowmein Hong Kong style, and the salt and pepper calamari. My husband and I lived the calamri. It was tender and tasty with the fried garlic.  My daughter loved the corn soup. And the chowmein was just okay."

"We had been on a food walking tour in chinatown the day before our last day in SF and I just couldn't get the Peking Duck we sampled out of my mind. I was craving it. So I did a little research on TA and found R&G. We arrived early on Sunday morning just as they opened and were immediately directed downstairs to be seated there were already 4 tables sat before us. Don't let the ""Lounge"" name fool you, you'll be eating downstairs in a dining room. The lounge is where I'm sure everyone who comes late has to wait to get a seat. 

We did a bit of homework with TA & Yelp as we always do to insure we know what to expect, both the good and the bad. We had read that one of the biggest concerns was in the language barriers and all the issues that creates. Not knowing what you think you'll want or expecting to ask the usual ""so what's good"" in a very, very busy restaurant is going to hurt.

We were greeted by a handsome server dressed in a tuxedo who welcomed us and took our drink order. The Menu was EXTENSIVE and thankfully with plenty of nice photo's. We decided on the obligatory BBQ Pork appetizer and of course we were getting the Peking Duck but darn if the next choice was simple as everything either looked or sounded so fantastic. The wife wasn't interested in what else I wanted (the house special salt & pepper crab) and decided on beef dish.  In the time it took to get hot tea and place our order the restaurant filled completely up Wow! That's usually a disaster for the kitchen, servers and customers all. But I never saw it. No one waited long. Everyone was moving, orders taken, drinks delivered. Didn't see anyone craning their neck for service. Sure there was a great deal of gawking as the food started to come out but with the plate presentations we saw that is to be expected. The S&P Crab was the obvious choice and every table except one seemed to get a least one order. But not us, no not us ;-(

The food was delivered promptly and the pork was a good as we've ever had just what you'd expect and hope for. The Peking duck - delish, instead of the more common Chinese pancakes they serve them with Bao buns and I must say I'm a real fan of this twist. It just takes it all to another level. (my mouth is salivating again) It was awesome, simply awesome. The beef was very good but come on CRAB. I even thought about ordering a crab but we were so stuffed there was truly no room to even kid ourselves.

Look this is a very busy place and if you expect perfection in anything other than the food you probably will be disappointed. There is a kind of numbness that unfortunately can come with that kind of success. As well as curtness for the uniformed. I know, I know it shouldn't be that way but so shouldn't  lot of other things in life. I run 2 very successful very busy restaurants and after 35 years in this business I don't like it but when you've waited 45 min to and hour to be seated and you have no idea what's on the menu or what you might like it's tough on everyone. For those that are reading this your not those kind of folks so spread the word and make it a better dining out world;-)"
"We were referred to R & G by a local foodie and they were right on the mark.  This restaurant is popular, with a substantial line out the door. Luckily, we had called for reservations, and so we jumped the line entirely and were seated almost immediately.

The food is well prepared and there are lots of choices, centering on crab and seafood.  Other reviews have mentioned that there is no dim sum, and that is true.  Their appetizer selections are limited, but we had a terrific salt & pepper calamari, and seafood lettuce wraps.

We ordered the gamut of entrees, and all six of our diners were happy with their choices.  My only comment was that the food is brought as it's finished in the kitchen, so the entrees are not served at the same time meaning that the diners are not all finished at the same time.  But more importantly, the food is brought fast and furious, as if to encourage you to eat quickly so they can turn the table over.  I strongly suggest that you set the pace and don't succumb to their service pace.  This is food worth lingering over.

One word of caution - one of our diners ordered the fried rice with X/O sauce.  Through a quirk of bad luck, he ended up with one spoonful that had 3 of the special peppers in that one spoonful.  The result was amusing for the rest of us (to watch him explode in sweat and have his tongue swell up), but I know it was an unpleasant surprise.  So be careful with the hot stuff, but enjoy a terrific restaurant."
"This is considered on of the best Chinese restaurants in Chinatown by our hotel and I could see why, the food was excellent. I really enjoyed the meal here. First, the restaurant attracts many local Chinese families, which is always a good sign and the food and service were just wonderful. We had many appetizers including the hot and sour soup, chicken and beef satay and pot stickers and all were wonderful. This dishes were just as good as the house fried rice, Mongolian Beef, the Spicy Honey Chicken and the Shrimp with noodles were all excellent choices. The waiter was on the ball with recommendations and his service was timely and friendly. A definite must if you are going to Chinatown in San Francisco."
"This place is crowded and few speak English. The locals know the food here is good and authentic. Secialties include battered Duneness crab, which is fantastic. great eggplant. Very good dumplings. No desert, but 2 block walk to wonderful bakery for Moon Pies"
"This restaurant is across the street  from the Hilton on Kearny St.  It is some of the best Chinese food I have ever eaten period.  The bartender was amazing too.  She made us smoking yuzu margaritas.  They were fantastic and fun.  The honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef and mixed seafood lettuce wraps were all off the charts.  Service was fast and efficient as well."
"We are Chinese from Europe and visited SF Chinatown earlier this month. I am a very experienced Chinatown visitor all over the world.

I thinking their speciality was crab, because lots of visitors were ordening this. We just had some vegetarian chowmein and some beef for a late brunch. The taste was good, The portion of the beef was small and we did not get an extra bowl of tea (something, which is very common in real Chinese restaurants in every Chinatown all over the world and which you should get for free). Somehow the obers were in a hurry, although it was not busy in the restaurant.

The worse thing was the tip. We only ate for US$32 and had no change so we gave the ober US$40. He just said 'thank you' and never came back with the change. They even ignored us while leaving and did not look up to pretend they did not understand that we were waiting for our change. They just expected a 40% tip on such a small order. Ridiculous ! A visitor should decide themselves how high a tip should be. That is the hospitality standard worldwide. So be aware, that you have some small change ready, before you visit this restaurant."
My husband loves crab!  It was so good he ordered 2 for himself.  My son agreed it is the best crab he has eaten.  The rest of the food we ordered was okay.  The all beef dish was too sweet for all our taste buds.  The fried rice was alright.  Come early (11:45 am) for lunch or expect a wait!
"Down and dirty, no frills, good Chinese eats. Ordered some pan-fried noodles, tofu and a eggplant dish, all arrived quickly and hot. Flavors are not too intense, heat level accommodated upon request."
"We met a good friend there on recommendation from the office locals.  Extremely crowded and one of the loudest restaurants I've ever been in.  We were seated on the lower level and it was just so loud.  The tables around us were yelling to be heard.  Took our order for 5 people and brought the following dishes one at a time, spaced far apart - salt/pepper crab, beef fried rice, chicken and broccoli (huge chunks of broccoli with no knives at the table) and chinese veggies.  Steamed rice we ordered was never delivered.  Asked multiple times for water - never able to order anything else to drink.  Service was sketchy at best.  Very disappointing.  Considering other options - I wouldn't return."
"Many people told me about R&G when I asked for a recommendation for Chinese food. I was surprised when I called around 5PM and got an 8PM reservation for the same day. Arrived around 8, was seated 5 minutes later, and got to skip the line. Everything is done family style so don't bother ordering individual entrees. The famous crab was just excellent, but awkward to eat and it fed three people. Everything with beef was just amazing, from the skewers to house special beef dish. Even the oyster dishes were wonderful. Service was polite and prompt. R&G is some of the best Chinese food I've ever had."
"My cousin was excited to eat here as he had seen it featured on Anthony Bourdain's TV show. Just on the out-skirts of Chinatown and across from our hotel, it was a short walk to the restaurant.  The bar area is small but comfortable. The place was bustling with staff and guests!
We waited maybe 40 minutes to be seated in the dining room behind the bar. Very non-descript looking place with many tables close together. Our drinks orders were taken and drinks arrived a good bit later with my drink missing. We ordered the salt and pepper crab (their specialty) and 2 other traditional Chinese dishes, but I can't remember exactly what. The food was good, but nothing exceptional. The crab was good, but again, nothing exceptional. Service was average. 
Admittedly, the guys thought the place was outstanding! I just didn't get it...."
"The first time we went to R & G Lounge we went about 7 o'clock. There were a ton of people and we waited about an hour and half. The second time, we went at about 6 o'clock and there was basically no one there! If you want to avoid the long line, then go early!
The food was excellent. The salt and pepper crab was a bit hard to eat and takes skill and patience, but the crab is so delicious! Especially the fried garlic with salt and pepper which is at the bottom at the plate (from the crab)!
We also tried the Mongolian Beef, Lemon Chicken, Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice, and the R & G Special Beef. The Mongolian Beef is kind of spicy, and the lemon chicken was pretty good, but not the best of everything we ate. The Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice had a lot of pineapple! The R & G special Beef was my favorite, with it's secret chef's sauce.
Overall very good!!"
"Long wait but the food was very good.  The salt and pepper crab while tasty was a lot of work and I would not order again.   The garlic noodles with shrimp, scallops and clams was amazing.  Lemon chicken also yummy.   Will recommend to others."
"Was recommended this place by a woman who lives in San Fran that we met in a diner that morning. After a long day sightseeing we discovered it was across the road from where we were staying so we gave it a go. It was packed which was a good sign and despite being told the wait might be an hour, 20 mins later we were sat at our table. Was great service and lovely food. Egg rolls were light and crispy, Satay was delicious, best lemon chicken I have had outside of Hong Kong and the Peking Duck, served with steamed buns, was cooked to perfection. Our waiter Kelvin was very attentive and we left very happy !

It's not cheap but it's not expensive and it's certainly worth it!"
"My favorite Chinese restaurant in San Francisco closed. So I thought I'd try this place. Meh. Average food, nothing spectacular. But not terrible either and it is authentic if uninspired."
"Choosing Chinese food in chinatown is surprisingly difficult, there's just too much choice.  This place was recommended by the hotel and was fantastic. There was ~45 min wait but it was definitely worth it. We had spring rolls, honey garlic chicken and kung po.  They  were all amazing. Great service and good value. We would definitely recommend it."
Very good Chinese in San Francisco's Chinatown. Environment is a bit stuffy but the food was on point. Mongolian Beef and Honey Garlic Chicken dishes will be great for those interested in American Chinese food dishes.
"Any place that serves snowpea leaves is an ""A"" in my book.  Sautéed with sesame oil with garlic and ginger - delicious.  The main dish was the salt & pepper crab.  Soooo good! Fresh, crisp coating, not overly greasy and meaty.  I didn't try anything else, and the menu was a little smaller than I expected.  I would come here again."
"This eatery was recommended to us by our tour bus guide, he rated it highly!
When we got to the restaurant it was mobbed outside with people queuing for a table.  We were given a ticket with a number and told our table would be available in 40 mins.  
We left to get a drink and returned 30 mins later.  It was 40 mins after this when we finally got a table and this was only after questioning the young waitress about her ticket system which had was not being adhered to.
We were shown to a table downstairs opposte the open kitchen door which resembled a wind tunnel.  I have never eaten anywhere so cold. 
As were were seated the rude waiter informed us the kitchen closed in 30 mins so all our order would arrive at one time.  If I had known this I would have eaten elsewhere.
The place is tacky, cheap tables, chairs, cutlery etc.  You only get one set of cutlery/chopsticks and one plate for everything you eat.
The food was very average and the whole place resembled a school kitchen.
This was possibly the worst recommendation I have ever had from anybody.
If I return to SF I'll definitely give this a miss."
"The food was excellent. Happened upon r+g by chance. Had planned on eating in a different Restaraunt but it was closed for Sunday night. Traveling with family and checking out central to northern cal. So after driving up from Monterey we were looking for dinner. Since first choice was closed we wandered down the street and saw RG. Saw very happy people walking out. We walked in and were seated immediately (late on a Sunday). Wait staff was very helpful. Started with oysters and pork which were excellent. Shared beef, chicken and salted fish rice. No one was disappointed. If I lived here it would be my go to Chinese Restaraunt.  Decor was nothing special , but who cares with food this good. Restaraunt was busy and loud but conversations could still be held without difficulty."
"Got here early because we skipped lunch. Arrived at 5:15 and they took us upstairs. Very soon the whole upstairs was crowded. We knew right away our meal would be great. We started with salmon/avocado egg rolls then ordered a veggie deluxe and a beef dish. The dishes don't come with anything. I don't eat meat so we couldn't share. The egg roll was very good. Vegetables were fresh and cooked just right. My companion said his beef was the best he has ever had. We felt very satisfied and full. I'm sure if you had a drink, appetizers, meal with rice or noodles and dessert it could easily be over $100 for two - but worth it."
"The foods are great especially ""special beef"" menu highly recommended is a must to eat, deep fried pork spare ribs very crunchy, garlic vegetables very fresh, crab is something worth trying ambience is nice clean and service is fast and price is reasonable. Recommended by Michelin guide."
"R & G is probably one of my most favorite Chinese restaurants ever that I like not on the sole basis of convenience. Everything I have ordered here throughout the years have been tasty, and bonus points for not looking like a dive (not there is anything wrong with that).

The garlic noodles, the Peking duck, the seafood combination in clay pot, and the calamari are among my favorites here. They all have great flavors and do not seem to be very heavy on the salt. On the other hand, others who have had their salt and pepper crab (from which I have allergic reaction), and their special beef (a meat which I simply just do not like) always rave about how delicious these entrees are. 

R & G is not your typical Chinese restaurant and their prices do reflect that. But they are a safe bet if you are looking to sample Chinese food in the largest Chinatown outside of Asia. I will go back again and again."
"My previous review from August of 2014 tells how we asked the attendants at the parking garage down the street for their recommendation, and ended up at R&G. We discovered it to be some of the best Asian food we have ever eaten, and this time was no different! Don't expect a quiet meal--the boisterous atmosphere is part of the culture. Embrace it, this is where local Asians eat! We came at lunch time both times, and so avoided lines, waiting, and the dinner crowd. But it was still busy, right from soon after opening. This time the waitstaff seemed a little bit confused and overwhelmed, but I think our person was new, and they did just fine. We have found the best experience comes from ordering entrees and sharing them all with each other. Again, be sure to order the wonderful beef!"
"All the lines of Chinese people waiting in lines around the block for R & G should be a good indication of the quality of this place. We live a few blocks from Chinatown, so get around a fair amount. R & G is our Friday night go-to restaurant, whether we eat there or get takeout for home in front of the TV.

Now, lots of our friends prefer divier spots, and there are plenty of those, many of them pretty good. But none of them can argue that the food here is fresh, not greasy, well seasoned and very well executed. We don't even come here for some of their star dishes like Crab and Sweet and Sour Soup. We are big fans of the Beef Chow Fun (get there early, they run out), Veggie Egg Rolls, Mu Shu Chicken or Veggie. I know, pretty pedestrian choices but they are great!

Sure it's more expensive than many other Chinese restaurants in the area so if you're really watching your wallet, maybe look at spots like Hunan Home or Z&Y Lounge. But R&G gets our vote!

Bonus - Michelle at the bar is a crazy-good mixologist!"
"Although the restaurant was packed, we waited about 40 minutes for a table.
We were very hungry , we were disappointed. food really left to be desired . restaurant was not clean and staff not very friendly or helpful. I would not recommend this restaurant, nor would i ever return."
"Popular eatery. Get there early to avoid the wait. Try something unique. Seafood clay pot, special beef, salt pepper scallop, sake clams were are good options for us. 

There are many exceptional options in chinatown this one is a very good option."
I followed Anthony Bourdain's advice and visited the R & G Lounge. This place is awesome - if you order the signature dish and signature cocktails. They really know how to do fried salt & pepper crab. Truly remarkable dish. Great Chinatown experience!
"Very ordinary Chinese food. I do not understand the positive reviews, perhaps i have been luckier with my restraurants in the past. I would not recommend this to anyone"
"We started with the salmon egg rolls. Excellent. Main courses were the 3 treasures, crab with black beans, cod signature dish, lobster with garlic sauce.  The cod is a signature dish and is outstanding!"
This beats the crab at Fisherman's Wharf.  It is better than any crab at any Chinese restaurant.  The crabs are fresh and is baked with salt and pepper.  There is always a line.  Reservations are highly recommended.  They validate parking for 2 hours in the nearby Portsmouth Square garage.
"I have no idea what the wait time is because we had a reservation and one of my party had an ""in"" with one of the managers who scored us a great table and no waiting. The lobby area was thick with people on the way in - sardine level by the time we left around 7:00 pm on a Saturday night. What are they all waiting for? - The food. If you know your Chinese well, this is the place for you - excellent execution - interesting takes on old favourites. But if you do not know your way around a Chinese menu - do what everyone else does and stick to the Crab (guy at the bar with 2 bottles of beer alone and a crab - seemed like a regular). Dungeness crab fried whole and served crispy. Quite a taste treat as the fast cooking renders the meat so smooth. We had sea cucumber cold with chili and onion, egg whites steamed with soup and clams (delicious and rarely seen), a simple dish of beef rib stewed until tender with mountain radish served with crushed chili, beautiful shrimps deep fried and then tossed in mayonnaise - sounds a bit over the top, but you're only eating one or two (I had four, I confess, but I was the out of towner in the group). Glazed Cod - pricey at $48, but what a piece of fish - none of your frozen fillets here. But it's not a romantic or relaxing meal - the place is super busy from lunch onwards I hear, so maybe a breather around 4:00 in the afternoon would mean it was a bit less frenetic. People, food, drinks, waiters, more food, everywhere. Conversation is not impossible - the throbbing music of most western restaurants is not there. And the place is not exactly elegant - the decor is mid 70's Dim Sum Palace Deluxe. But if you are like I was - on a biz trip/holiday with a group of people who all enjoy eating, it's worth it. Dive in."
"10 of us arrived for a family dinner and we were given our own room. We had two waiters and they didn't miss a beat. The food was wonderful. From soup and egg rolls to pork dishes, chicken dishes, seafood dishes and beef dishes to rice. It was all great! We'll be back."
"This place doesn't have the appeal that someone from Iowa would grasp on to while on holiday in SFO.  R&G Lounge, who other than the in the know Asians from China town would go into a place like that ??  We were on a wedding holidays with friends, one a beat detective from this area of SFO, which is how we got in.  We had our own room, well there were thirteen of us.  The bill had to be heavy, we had damn near everything on the menu.  I'm told Chinese people don't eat rice, what's up with that ???  I don't recall rice on the table, but PeKing Duck was, along with so many other things It's senseless to try to remember all of it.  We all were happy, of course it's always more fun on someone else's credit card ???  So...if you're traveling on business with associates, do it, put up with the huge lines and deal with it, it's a sure thing, Salida1048"
"We came here for the Peking Duck. The skin was not crispy and instead of thin pancakes, we were served soft bao rolls with little pockets for stuffing in the duck meat, scallions and hoisin sauce. I was quite disappointed.   However the menu is extensive and from the way locals and tourists were eating with gusto at the other tables, I might give R & G lounge another try on my next trip to San Francisco though for Peking Duck I will go elsewhere."
This must be one of the best restaurants in China town. We arrived in a party of eight without booking and were seated immediately. The food was excellent and the service was fast and efficient. Would certainly return and would highly recommend.
"Very popular and crowded restaurant. We remembered enjoying it last time we were in SF, but we found the food average this time. Staff were very polite and service as efficient."
This has to be the best Chinese food in Chinatown. I have tried quite a few and this place does not disappoint. The fried stone crab is the jewel and specialty and all the other dishes are always fresh and tasty. Just remember this is not americanized chinese food so go in and expect the way it is supposed to be cooked :)
"We got a ticket for a table and were told it would be about 30 minutes - which turned into a long hour but we got to go for a stroll around Chinatown and do the people watching in this crowded bustling restaurant. We had a really lovely waiter who even threw in a few sides for free because we had waited a little while between dishes (it wasn't very long actually). The crab was great and the other dishes really really tasty. It was definitely an experience with the noisy, crowded bustling atmosphere but we loved it. Glad we ventured down there."
The food was less than mediocre. It was expensive and the place was FILTHY. Not what we had hoped for when it was recommended to us. We were totally grossed out. I am submitting the picture of what I am assuming is a hairball? That was on the floor beside me. I dropped a piece of paper and leaned over to pick it up. NO WAY. I did it anyway but had the shivers for a while. Do not go here.
"This was a highly recommended place for dinner in Chinatown, and their famous salt and pepper crab was tasty and obviously a big draw, but the price was pretty steep for a meal delivered with hurry and a faint whiff of impatience.  I felt as if we couldn't get done and out of there fast enough, which soured any true enjoyment of the meal."
"I have eaten here a couple times per year for a few years. The food is always hot, well prepared and delicious. One of my USA favorites for chinese. Crab is excellent but not cheap (nor should it be)."
"Have dined here many times,  a coupke times each year. most recently feb 2015.
Usually crowded, but excellent and authentic chinese specialties. Good bar also.  Very Highly recommend. Decent prices considering where it is."
"We were directed three by our concierge and got a ticket to wait in the entrance. Loads of Chinese came after U.S. And got tables ahead until finally we got a small table at the back of the till. We were ignored for the first twenty minutes and then got our order thrown at us. The food was terrible and would not feed it to my dog let alone treat my dog like they treated us. Avoid this place. It is busy, but all locals and maybe they get food from a different kitchen."
"We ate at R&G on the recommendation of a hotel doorman. We had just arrived in San Francisco. It was lunchtime. We were hungry. The meal was not the best thing I've ever had, but it was quite good. It was a very nice start for our visit."
"Great restaurant when you have a need for Chinese.  There are lines and chaos, but you can choose to eat quickly at the bar.  This is a great place for food and atmosphere, be prepared to speak loudly and to catch waiters on the run between tables.  But overall food beats any other issues and would recommend this place to anyone needed good Chinese in SF."
"We were recommended by a local but were told it would be busy and we would have to wait, we only ended up waiting 10minutes at the bar. The food was great and the service was quick. Loved it."
"Extremely busy even on weekday nights.
Had to wait an hour on Wednesday night.
Popular with locals as well as tourists it seemed.
Food was good but pricey.  Tofu dish for $17?? Oh well.
I'd go back if I'm in town again."
"Four of us got there late--15 minutes before the kitchen closed.  But they welcomed us in, took our order and food was excellent.  The funny thing was that we didn't eat our rice and were planning to take it home, but when they cleaned off the table we were chatting and the rice was gone, gone, gone."
"This was highly recommended by several people we met and on many website lists as one of the best in Chinatown.  Not in my book.  The hot & sour soup was very good, and a huge bowl for the table was $15, very good price.  All other entrees we had were mediocre at best, nothing special, not bad but certainly not great.  Menu is large, many choices.  Very busy, very crowded, very noisy, and not clean at all, the upstairs bathrooms are pretty bad, and the hallway to get there is disgusting.  Did not have time to try another place in Chinatown on this trip, I hope there is a better place than this."
"There are tons of eating options in SF Chinatown but our hotel concierge and Fodor's agreed -- go to the R&G. The name is a bit off-putting (does not sound very Asian) but you are there for the food, not the name. R&G is a sure bet in the very competitive Chinatown restaurant scene. Décor is functional and service is very good (although only a few of the wait staff speak English). Great Spring Rolls and try the garlic prawns -- best ever!"
"The crab was very tasty, but the fragrant beef was even better.  The soy sauce chicken was also excellent.  Service was good, but our waiter forgot to bring our steamed rice.  He was really busy though.  The place was packed with locals.  It was a little on the expensive side, but we had more than enough food.  The lychee martini was delicious.  I would return."
"Loved the BBQ beef noodle soup; service better than most Chinese restaurants.  However, didn't get spoons w/our soup & had to look for waiter a few times."
"Whenever I'm in Chinatown, I always drop by here. The dimsum is so good. They're always busy so expect at least 30-40 min waiting time. But I can assure you being a San Fran native, this is the best in the area."
"After reading all the reviews and watching Anthony Bourdain eat Salt & Pepper Crab, my wife and I had to make the pilgrimage. Before going to the Wok Shop on Grant we treated ourselves to this great dish. The crab was good but $48 was a little steep but it was more than enough for two. The Bok coy for $14 was also a little pricey. Bring your American Express."
"Where should I start?  The hostess had no manners and would yell go down stairs, go upstairs and not take you to seat. We waited 45 minutes and watched it happen to everyone.  We were seated directly next to fish tanks that housed fish, lobster, and crab.  Let me tell you to  stay clear of the fish!!  There were about 8-10 fish but probably 5 were DEAD!  And...I personally witnessed a fish plucked out with a hand to be served for dinner!  We didn't order fish but I felt our food could have been purchased at a roadside Chinese restaurant. NOT IMPRESSED and do not recommend.  Also...they brought rice without asking for it or if we wanted it and charged $6...!  Not used to that at a restarting.   The bill was $62+tip for two adults and a child."
"I visited this evening with a friend and we were looking forward to it as we had read many reviews and heard that it was amazing. We had to wait a little bit, but this almost seemed a good thing as it was the busiest restaraunt in town. However, we ordered half a duck to share between the two of us for $25 plus tax and were very disappointed that there was hardly any duck on it at all, we only managed enough for two pancakes. It was mainly bone and there was hardly any sauce/onions to go with it. We were just a little disappointed after hearing such great things and left still feeling very hungry."
"My  husband and I had lunch here. We were lucky that we arrived early and were immediately seated. By noon the small restaurant was packed. The food was excellent. The hot and sour soup was outstanding, his traditional soup was also good. He ordered the honey ribs which finger licking good. My spicy shrimp with  noodles was excellent. We were thrilled with this gem of a restaurant and will return next time in San Francisco. My husband also brought a friend with him on another day for lunch, this friend is a food critic and was totally impressed with the experience. Don't miss this restaurant!"
"My wife and I visited with another couple for dinner. The wait was about an hour and a half but there's plenty of other things to visit in Chinatown. Food was top notch, get the fried crab. Service was excellent."
"We went on a Monday night and it was mobbed.  It was about a 40 minute wait for a couple.  We both enjoyed our meals but the service was below average.  One of our drinking glasses had lipstick on it and the waiter just shrugged and gave us another.  I'd have expected more of an apology because it was quite gross.  Also the waiter seemed disappointed that we did not order drinks.  People say this place is expensive, you be the judge two entrees with tip $50."
"The Lounge is misleading and quite small as this is a major restaurant in Chinatown.  Everyone knows this is the place for their awesome salt & pepper Dungeness Crab dish....which is why the long lines to get in.  Recommend reservations or you'll wait.  If you don't like getting your hands messy, then there are many other items on the menu to choose....go for the special beef dish...delish."
"May 12, 2105.
We made a reservation in the afternoon and came back for dinner. First we started with Lychee martinis and salmon/avocado egg rolls. The martinis were a little sweet, but tasty. First time we ever had one. The egg rolls were delicious. Then we ordered the famous salt and pepper crab and honey walnut prawns. The crab was unbelievable and so were the prawns. The Crab is deep fried with a very light batter with salt and pepper. What a taste sensation. The service was excellent and the food was delivered fast. One note, this is not an inexpensive Chinese restaurant. Bring your big credit card. All side dishes are ala cart. Some of the reviews that criticized the food should be disregarded. If you are a true epicurean, you should go out of your way you eat here."
"We thought this place would be good.......based on good reviews and the local and predominantly Chinese customers.  We shared the satay starter and then had main courses of honey spare ribs and chicken with broccoli in black bean sauce. The chicken and beef of the starter was fried and quite dry. The ribs were ok but quite fatty and the chicken should have been spicy but wasn't at all.  Like some of the other reviews say the service is very 'bish, bash, bosh, see you later'.  Overall we found it slightly below average."
Salt and pepper crab was terrible. Peking duck had more bones and little to no meat. Fried rice was not fried.  It was white rice with a few small pieces of pork with a few scallions. No flavor but was the best thing we were served. Would not recommend and will not go back.
Food was excellent but service poor. Staff didn't seem interested as we were tourists and not local. Didn't get everything we ordered as waiter taking our order was talking to the table behind us while serving us. When I asked for a glass of water the first waiter couldn't understand me although spoke perfectly to the American diners! Shame as the food we had was really good.
"You figure you've found a good spot when the other diners are predominantly local and Chinese.  And, on the night we were there, the Japanese Consulate had arranged a private event. It did not disappoint.  One surprise was that this place knows how to make a martini.  
We tried the signature Dungeness Crab - our choice was the ginger and scallion seasoning. It was delicious, even if we did have to work a bit for our dinner. Making a mess was worth the effort.  The spicy green beans are also terrific. Make a reservation, because it is a popular spot."
A great place to dine for dinner. All around good chinese menu. Service was prompt and the wait staff was very attentive. Reasonable priced and quick. Will definitely go back.
Famous salt and pepper crab was very good but way overpriced. The waiter was pleasant but the our table was too small and uncomfortable. Revisited this restaurant after 2 years but it is too crowded and table is not comfortable .Will bypass this restaurant next time we visit San Francisco.
"This place offers excellent chinese food!
The crab with salt and pepper is amazing; but so is their beef and pork dishes.
Their prawns served with honey glazed walnuts are also excellent.

Beware though they have huge portions!

Highly recommended if you're looking for a good Chinese food in SF!"
"The decor is nothing to write home about and the service is a bit curt, but the food was great and it was fun to see all the families, many with four generations, sharing a big meal together. There were many there celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, etc. We had the fabulous hot and sour soup and then shared the Peking Duck (the half order was even too much) and a moo shu pork. Both dishes were very good but it was too much food for us. The place was packed the whole time we were there, mostly with folks who seemed to be locals, and the menu is quite extensive. This is a great place if you are planning to eat in Chinatown."
In 2011 I went to this restaurant a. was very good. however. I went again this year. changed a lot and was very poor. zero customer service. respect for the customer and zero interest. I have an appointment in the morning but still I waited 20 minutes at the entrance. meals were served in front of me as I want to officially discarded. continuous left dirty and messy table during dinner. food was nice but service disappointing. I would never go again. I'm adding a picture showing the mess table during dinner.
"The food was adventurous, fun, and tasty. We tried a few of the house specials and were not disappointed. Hot tea served with every meal, quick and attentive service."
"Recommended to us and not let down. Fresh flavours and great atmosphere. Tasty chicken and sweet corn soup, fresh calamari and awesome spicy Mongolian lamb. You won't be disappointed."
"Businesstraveller44 has pretty much nailed this place in his description. We got a recommendation from a friend in London. Then got lost on our way here. Asked a local gentleman for directions. He knew the place well and asked us if we knew we were headed for one of the best authentic Chinese restaurants in the area. It's busy - really busy. They whipped out a table and we ate near the front desk! But, they did it to allow room for our baby's pushchair (she was asleep). Service was super efficient but, as others have said, don't expect people to stand and chat. They'll make sure your every need is taken care of. The crab really is that good, btw. As is the honey chicken and their special beef. 

Go and enjoy the experience"
This is their signature dish and don't miss it. It was amazing. The Kung pao shrimp and lamb was amazing the cashew chicken was ok
"First - make a reservation any day of the week.  That ought to tell you something.  Second, don't expect table cloths, candles, a waiter in a tux or a sommelier.  R & G is a family Chinese restaurant whose obvious focus is on putting really good Chinese food on the table for people to enjoy.  It is not to provide a socially acceptable ""properly served"" dining experience.  And they are very, very, very good at what they do!! 

Reception seems to be fairly routine.  The customer(s) walk in, give their name the greeter looks at a list and can't find your name, but tells you to ""wait over there"".  Don't panic, and don't say ""I HAVE A RESERVATION"".  Just wait over there and in about 5 minutes you will be told to go either upstairs or down stairs.  There are two dining rooms, one up, one down, nothing in the middle.  Got me but it seems to work quite well.  So you follow your instructions and walk up or down stairs, and wait another minute or so, hold up your fingers indicating how many are in your party, and somebody walking by immediately takes you to a table and drops a pot of very hot tea on it.  Yes, I'm serious, there are no table cloths, they just get in the way.  They will also drop off chop sticks, but don't worry, they will watch you and if it's at all obvious that you have no idea what to do with them they will drop off a fork without you having to ask

Ordering -  the menu is extensive.  DO NOT order a meal for everyone or you'll miss a really great experience and end up with way more food than you could or should eat.  Everybody in your group should look at the menu and come up with some ideas on what looks good or what they might like.  Everybody agree on several selections appetizers if you want, main courses, They will come to the table on large plates, and then everybody in your group just digs in.  If in the unlikely circumstance that you are still hungry, just order some more stuff and start the process all over again.

Yes, they have beers and wine and soda and water, but you really didn't go to this restaurant to drink did you.

Any suggestions?  If you like seafood, order the Salt n Pepper Crab.  It is HUGE, and delicious and definitely one that you put in the middle of the table and let everybody enjoy.

Pricy? Not bad, remember you are in San Francisco where the tech industries pay their people way too much, so its San Francisco pricing, but definitely not something you have to save up for.

If you have a chance go there, it's just great oriental food without all of the tourist trappings and foodie overload.

Enjoy"
"If I go to San Francisco for just a day, I would go to r&g at 3 pm and have the crab
Need I say more"
"The service of the restaurant is fast, and I believe this is one of the better place which serves good overall Chinese food suitable to locals and travelers.  Must order the salt n pepper crab, its worth it."
"I came to the R & G lounge at the recommendation of my friend, who grew up in San Francisco and I am so glad that she suggested the R & G Lounge. I called in advanced and had reservations, but there were dozens of people waiting to be seated. I highly recommend that you make reservations if you are planning on dining here. The food was phenomenal, but as a vegetarian that doesn't eat sea food, there were very few options for me. Regardless, my meal was fantastic and I would highly recommend it."
"If I go to San Francisco for just a day, I would go to r&g at 3 pm and have the crab
Need I say more"
"Even though we had reservation, our wait was for over an hour! Amazing drinks at the small bar, best cocktails menu I have ever experienced in an Asian restaurant  Food was excellent, fresh, flavorful and served quickly. Will make sure I revisit!"
the best crab we have ever eaten. All of other dishes were perfect too. But this place get very crowded therefore R&G have some problems in customer service.
"Arrived about 8:30 without a reservation and,boy, they were very busy with a lot of people waiting.  We were promptly put on a list and given a number.  We were seated within 10 minutes.  In spite of how busy they were, a menu and China tea were delivered.  Service was really quick and whilst the staff didn't have a great deal of time to gossip, they were friendly and polite.  The atmosphere was noisy.  This isn't the sort of restaurant that you go to for the decor and wow factor, you go for the food.  My wife had lemon chicken and I had deep fried oysters and salt and pepper spare ribs.  For an appetiser, how many deep fried oysters can you eat?!  They were delicious and the spare ribs were fantastic.  Based in China Town, this place should be a must.  We also felt very safe walking around there at night."
"Recommended to us by our driver for dinner the first night in SF and the food did not disappoint. We had sweet corn soup, grilled fish, and several chicken dishes. Everything tasted great. Service however is lacking. Hostesses are abrupt and eaiters are non attentive to your requests so often have to ask twice."
"We loved this restaurant!  We were given a referral here by a local resident, and it did  not disappoint.  We went for lunch and my husband had the fried crab--delicious!  It is served looking completely whole, though easily comes apart. I had scallops and they were very big and delicious.  Large portions, service was great.  I would definitely return."
"We've been to this restaurant twice in 6 years.  Both times, we were recommended by hotel concierge staff.  I swear, the decor hasn't changed one little bit.  The place was just as busy as the first time we went and I was just as unimpressed with the food which I thought was expensive.  I love chinese food - I'm used to eating in London's China Town and the food there is MUCH better.  If we go back to San Francisco, this will NOT be on my dining list!!"
"This was the worst experience of our whole trip to SF.

We had heard sterling reviews from a number of sources about this place and naturally, being Oriental food enthusiasts, we were excited to pay this place a visit. 

Upon entering all seemed well, we were told we could have a table straight away despite the large congregation of people in the bar area downstairs waiting to be seated.
Unfortunately, it was all downhill thereafter. 

The waiters seemed bored and miserable. I had to ask 2 of them for a menu as they completely ignored our presence after we had sat down. One of them literally threw a fork across the table in my general direction when he brought over the cutlery and condiments.

We ordered the chicken & sweetcorn soup which was fine, and about halfway through our starter the drinks order finally turned up.
The main course (one of which was a R&G Lounge recommended house special) was bland and 
uninventive. 

The waiter brought the bill to the table before we had even finished our main course or asked for it. The final straw being the high price we paid for this meal in return for what we received.

Overall a terrible dining experience from an establishment which is clearly thriving from the overhyped recommendations from the tour operators. 

Avoid and find another restaurant in Chinatown."
"To  celebrate the ""Year of the Ram"" we arrived early to relax and enjoy food and libations.   The very friendly and courteous bartender, aside from regular drinks, showed us a few innovative original mixed drinks.. Abruptly the hostess rudely informed us that we MUST proceed to our table.  It was about 20 minutes before our appointed time, but we obliged.  The waiter was very condescending, and we were able to finish our drink and converse at our table.  

We enjoyed an OUTSTANDING  dinner featuring Peking duck and their salt and pepper crab.  We also enjoyed steamed crab in creamed beaten eggs and spicy eggplants in garlic sauce......along with a few choice Chinese vegetable dishes.

The cost for a Chinese restaurant is upper level, but worthwhile.  The mannerism of the hostess could be improved with a little genuine warmth when greeting and attending patrons.  This will greatly enhance the pleasure of dining here."
"There were four of us and we shared several dishes.  We ordered the shrimp fried rice, chicken and beef kabobs, the crab salt and pepper, scallops, the snow pea greens, to name a few.  They were all delicious.  My only complaint would be the crab seemed a bit salty, but the presentation of it was a must see!  So cool!  We ordered a bottle of saki and it was delicious.  We sat downstairs but noticed there was seating upstairs as well.  Upstairs seemed to be a little more quiet and a little more formal.  When I go back I will ask for upstairs seating.  We were glad we made reservations as there was a huge line when we got there-will visit again!"
"While we very much enjoyed our food, we were not ""wowed"" by our experience. The food was very good, although we didn't specify that we were ordering off the lunch menu, so we were charged dinner pricing. Service was quick, although not overly friendly. We loved the basement atmosphere (the wood paneling is beautiful), although it was a bit loud at lunch on a Friday. 
On a side note, we found it a bit odd that it appeared tables were given chopsticks / silverware / both based on the appearance of the patrons - we had to ask for chopsticks after our food was delivered, so if that's something you plan on using, you may need to ask."
"Now why is there that perpetual line out the door? Because this is one of the last Chinese restaurants in Chinatown that serves authentic Cantonese food, that hasn't been wrecked by the tourist trade. It's Chinese. It has real Chinese people eating in it. And what are they eating? Well, they're eating the crab (which you must eat), the squab, the squid, the ling cod with ginger and scallion, the vegetarian goose, the special ""secret"" R and G beef. A little off the beaten path (on Kearney, down by Portsmouth Square). Want to avoid the line? Make a reservation: it's not rocket science."
"had a good meal but did not have their"" salt and pepper"" crab. had very good boneless ribs, low mein and and excellent black cod. the negatives was a very ordinary peking duck. a simple no frills restaurant with very good service."
"Delicious scallops, beef, chicken, clams.... We tried lots of different dishes and all were spectacular. I also noted that we waited a while for a table and so we waited at the bar. They have some wonderful signature drinks. I tried a smoked cherry martini that was very nice."
"We were told this place had one of the most iconic meals in Chinatown and we were, unfortunately, very disappointed.

When we put our name on the list, we were told it would be about a 45-minute wait.  Given how packed the place was, we were fine with that and took a stroll around Chinatown while we waited.  40 minutes later we got back to the restaurant and were told it would be another 45 minutes.  Again, given how busy the restaurant was, we figured it was worth the wait, so we squeezed ourselves into the bar area to get a drink while we were waiting.

As far as we're concerned, don't bother trying to get a drink unless you're sitting directly at the bar.  While most bartenders eventually take a look at the patrons stacked four and five deep at their bar, the bartenders at R&G seemed like they were specifically avoiding eye contact with anyone not sitting directly in front of them.  We waited 30 minutes to get our first drink and were only given that opportunity because a nice gentleman at the bar flagged down a bartender and pointed him to us, saying we would like to order a drink.  He was also nice enough to give my wife his seat when his number was called.  We thought things were looking up.

Sadly we were mistaken.  About 10 minutes after we got our first drink ours and four other numbers were called, so we relinquished our spot at the bar and made our way to the hostess stand, all of 10 feet, only to find out that there had only been one table ready and the hostess had called five numbers and given it to whomever had showed up first.  Frustratingly, we saw this happen several times.  Several people walked out due to the horrible host services.

Finally, two hours after we had initially walked in, we were seated at a tiny table in the hallway behind the bar that leads to a dining room and the kitchen.  While we had been waiting, we had seen ~10 orders of Fried Dungeness Crab (apparently a hose specialty) come to or through the bar area.  We had seen the dish on TV and had already decided it didn't make any sense to us and would not be ordering it.  However, having seen that many people order it and profess to like it, we caved and ordered one.

We should have stuck to our guns; it was soaked in grease and tasted utterly disgusting.  We didn't finish it.  The best thing we ordered was a $15 plate of vegetables.

Overall, we were very disappointed in the service and the food and left hungry after spending >$100."
"If you are not Chinese this place will overcharge and treat you poorly.  My main came out 20 minutes before my wife's and they still insisted that I pay for half.  A two hour meal with barely food for one cost me $70.00.  This place sums up my crap experience is San Fransico.  Spend your money somewhere else, this town blows!!"
Nice serving size for plates of food. Big pot of delicious hot tea. Always busy and full of locals. Waiting area and bar is small to wait at.
"Order the Salt and Pepper Crab Dish. You won't be disappointed! This was easily the best crab I have ever eaten. Get there early or make sure to place reservations for special occasions, because this place get crowded.  My family was looking for a good Chinese meal after spending the afternoon in Chinatown and I asked a local store owner to recommend an authentic restaurant. She suggested R & G Lounge. I'm glad I asked. Good service, fast, and efficient! I will definitely return to R & G anytime I'm in the San Francisco area."
"Our group of 10 enjoyed the upstairs dining at a local favorite, R&J. The chinese specialties were delicious and we enjoyed the family style serving with turntable in middle of our dining table. Our server was very conscientious and responsive to our requests. Everyone enjoyed the substantial amount of food and beverages."
We went because the reviews we read were very positive.  The food was mediocre at best and the service was also not acceptable.  Maybe we picked the wrong menu items (though they were both house specials).  We will not be returning.
"I am from Hawaii and love Chinese food and seafood.  My husband and relatives make a special trip to this restaurant several times when we come to SF.  It's a very busy restaurant but I have always been seated in a reasonable time, even without a reservation.  Food, in my opinion, arrives quickly and hot.  Spices just right!"
"The worst Chinese meal we have ever had in the world, no atmosphere, no flavour.
Avoid this poor excuse for Chinese restaurant and find another nearby"
"After reading previous reviews on R and G Lounge, our group of 6 was able to get in right at 4 pm when it opened.  We ordered our food and it was served very quick although it came out staggered.  Everybody's dish was hot and very delicious. We made a point of sharing between all of us.  There was a small discrepancy on the final bill but staff fixed it immediately.  The food was amazing and everybody left happy."
"The crowds waiting for tables at this Michelin-rated restaurant were promising; we arrived without reservations for dinner, and waited about half an hour which we expected.  We were seated in the main floor room which was very pleasant; space is compact so it can be noisy.  Service was attentive, and our order arrived fairly quickly.  Portions are medium-to-small compared to other Asian restaurants, and more expensive.  Mongolian beef was everyone's favorite, cooked nicely and sauced well.  Vegetarian egg rolls were very good, although they were more crispy wrapper than filling.  Moo Shu was good and, while tasty, was nearly all cabbage with very little protein.  The disappointment, and the most expensive, was Peking duck which was delivered to the table in meat-cleavered sections with bone-in which was a surprise to us since elsewhere we've always been served boneless duck; there was not much meat and we wrestled a bit removing it from the bones, there was quite a lot of gristle, and the accompanying buns were still cool from refrigeration.  We'd be happy to return next time we're in San Francisco, but we'd read other reviews to make good selections given the price."
"This place gets really busy, both for lunch and dinner.  For the latter, reservation is highly recommended.  So come early to avoid long waits. We come here often for lunch and the specials are pretty good and reasonably priced. Dinner pricing, as expected is much higher.  For small groups, they would send you downstairs, while upstairs seem to be for bigger groups.  For claustrophobic folks, request upstairs seating.  There is a private room, which can accommodate 10 to 12 people comfortably.  Food is great and lately the service has been quite commendable.  During our last trip, we enjoyed the beef brisket wonton and their Kung Pao shrimp."
We did not much enjoy our meal. Portions were quite small and quite expensive. There are better choices in the area.
"This is great Asian food but quite noisy. They have tables upstairs, downstairs, behind the bar and on the first level. Definitely go there for the food, but don't try to converse - too noisy."
"I traveled to SF on business and dined here with colleagues on the recommendation of a SF native.  We had dinner reservations but still waited for 30 minutes to be seated.  The food was worth the wait!  The restaurant was super busy, which we took as an excellent sign.  We were shown to a table downstairs, no windows, wood paneling, vinyl banquet chairs and wood veneer tables with inexpensive Asian prints decorating the walls.  A large tank with some sort of crustacean life occupied a central spot on the dining room floor.  For all its lack of charming décor, though, we had a very enjoyable meal.  We were told to try the salt and pepper crab, a signature dish.  It's a Dungeness crab (it being the season) deep fried in seasoning, and it's greasy and delicious.  We had the honey prawns, a chicken dish, and a beef dish (I can't recall the names of those but they were delicious as well). Service was very good and attentive, only complaint is the server did not pour the tea, and the pot was very heavy so we kind of made a mess.  All in all, an authentic Chinatown experience, so glad we got the recommendation to dine there!"
Great Authentic Chinese food. Worth the trip!!! Tasted awesome and service was exceptional. Atmosphere was very good and the place was very clean.
"This restaurant was recommended by a young Chinese man and we found it utterly charming. The service was very good and the food was yummy. I've read some less than favourable reviews about the price and the service, but the two of us shared a starter and had a main course each and a glass of wine and some sparkling mineral water and we paid about $50. The service was good, but the restaurant wasn't too busy at the time. Our experience was very good and we went back to thank the young Chinese man for his recommendation."
"We ordered the Salmon Egg Rolls.... (poor... pass on those); Main entrees were their signature beef dish (very good) and Peking Duck (good).  My wife had the Lychee Martini (good); I had a glass of Cab (OK).  We got right in with a reservation for 6:30pm on a Wednesday night in January.  at 7:30pm, there was a one hour wait.  They turned they tables like you were at a McDonalds.  They delivered our beef entrée before the appetizer arrived.  We refused it and our server became very upset.  We signaled for our waiter... explained what was going on and he apologized and took care of it.  Everything was very rushed and seating was right on top of each other.. (chairs bumping).  Pricing was $10 each for drinks; $16-20 for entrees; $10 for appetizers.  It had a ""diner"" feel.... (we knew that going in... so ""ok"".... but don't be fooled.. there is nothing eloquent about this place if that is what you are looking for).  We've had MUCH better Chinese all around the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.... so from that perspective we were disappointed.  I noticed they had Michelin recommended certs from 2013 and 2015.. so they must not be too bad."
"Two of us visited R and G Lounge as we had watched the Anthony Bourdain tv program a while ago. 
We can confirm it was indeed excellent .Service is prompt ,fine and honest ,no small talk but thats ok with us.Its not a fancy place by any means ,although the white tablecloth was a nice touch.
Arriving at 11.30am on Sunday morning after walking through the streets of Chinatown ,R and G s
was about a quarter full ,and people were continuously being seated during our time there. 
The satay was our least favourite dish ,although the beef satay was nicer than the chicken sewers. 
Salt and pepper scallops were delicious ,3 treasures dish was spicy and tasty ,but the Baked Black Cod was amazing ,and something we would go back for on a return visit to San Francisco.
It takes a fair while to prepare and the waiter let us know this in advance ,but its definitely worth it.!"
We were welcomed with complimentary tea whilst we chose from the menu. The food was tasty and well presented and reasonably priced. We went back again the same week we enjoyed it that much.
"We arrived at 3:45 w/o a reservation. They open at four and there was already a line. We put out names on the list and at four they called us. We had to promise to be done before 5:30 before they would seat us (and everyone else who was waiting) Made for a pricey/rushed dinner which was not what we planned.
Overall the food was good. I think if I had to do it over I would have passed on the crab and gotten something more substantial. We were all hungry later and had to stop somewhere for a late snack.
The Peking duck looked great and our calamari was good. And kids split a noodle dish and salmon avocado spring rolls.
They brought the check to us by 5:15"
"Food is overall good quality and well-prepared but overpriced.  There is almost nothing under $15 - even for a small plate of stir-fried greens.   But the place is jam packed with long line ups.
Service is prompt and attentive - very efficient but seemed kind if hurried, maybe because of the lineups.  Nice decor though."
"This place was recommended to us  as a great Chinese restaurant by several people.  Our only positive experience was that we arrived early enough to avoid the lines that formed later.  A disinterested staff and seating by a busy staircase began our dining experience.  The menu was confusing and our waiter was no help and was annoyed we didn't order immediately.  He thrust a pot of warm tea at us and disappeared.  When we finally got his attention and ordered we waited for almost half an hour to get served.  The spring rolls were tasteless and barely warm.  The shrimp chow mien consisted of six medium shrimp sitting on a pile of noodles, no vegetables, no condiments, no flavor.  A small bowl of rice was an extra charge for my husband's order. We had to ask twice for water and then got a very small glass that was never refilled.  Along with two other uninspired dishes we ended up with a $90.00 bill.  We had really hoped to have a spectacular oriental meal in a city known for great Chinese food."
"Like every thing, Didn't like that I got full and couldn't continue eating! Had the Honey Ribs. Don""t like Calamari, but my wife ordered it. It came with out dipping sauces or Lemon wedges. One of the best tasting appetizers I've ever eatin. Some times I walkin, some times im sleepin, this time i was foodin, and boy was I enjoyin! Had the chicken soup with my wife. Ate some of her Spicy Chicken. Look. I give good food two thumbs up. Who doesn't like good food? This is great Food. Great Food. Try it."
"I went to San Francisco some weeks ago, I was looking for a chinese restaurant as everybody says it is great in the bay. We asked to several people, and everybody suggested R&G Lounge, so we tried to make a reservation by phone and in person, but it appeared difficult however we stopped by and the waiter accommodate us immediately. The restaurant is not a fancy venue, but we had really great food in all varieties sleected: black cod, pekin duck and fried rice, all very well prepared and served right to the point. The service was very good. The check was a bit above this type of restaurant, but cheap compared with what we ordered and the wine (did I mention the wine list includes some great options for a fair price?)"
"Service was very good but was very average the signature dish the salt and pepper crab was not as great as it was advised to be, we had three other dish with this main that we flavourless. A little disappointing. The lychee mojito very fantastic. 

Overall if you want very good service with an average meal with great drinks then this is place to go."
"We came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago, the restaurant was not busy at the time however we were seated downstairs in a small room near the restroom. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer which was very greasy. The waiter was kind enough to return the calamari and remove the item from the bill. As the main course we ordered a spicy eggplant dish and some noodles which both items were very greasy also. The waiter never returned to pour us more water or ask if we would like anything else. Do not think I would ever go there again. The reason why we choose this restaurant because Anthony Bourdain review them a couple of years ago."
This three story chinese restaurant was packed with locals.  Don't be fooled by the exterior.  The menu was extensive with lots of seafood.  The place is famous for salt and pepper crab.  We had the salt and pepper ribs and they were delicious.  Prices were very reasonable and we will be going back.
"We came here on a very busy night but was lucky enough to get seated quickly behind the bar since there was only two of us.  Despite being busy, the service was excellent.  The salt and pepper crab was delicious. It is pricey but it was worth it. The honey walnut shrimp was also very good."
"A cab driver suggested this place on our first night, we ate here 3 more times. It is now a must go when i am close to San Fran"
"Went to SFO recently and heard about how great RG's is. Service was terrible, not even bad but terrible. Food was about the same. Duck was the worse I have ever had and the signature dish of the crab isnt that good. Not sure what all the good reviews are from. Maybe an off night or just way below my expectations."
We ate at R&G as a large group recently and it was fantastic.  The shrimp dish was one of the best shrimp dishes I have ever had and the Peking Duck was fabulous!  Service was friendly and efficient.  I will definitely return again and again to R&G.
"We ate lunch here twice on our recent vacation to San Francisco. They have an incredible menu with quite a few unique dishes we had never heard of ~ with good service and GREAT food. From the moment the doors opened there were lines of people waiting ~ and every table was full. You are immediately aware that this is a place often frequented ~ their signature dishes include the tastiest whole crabs that we devoured with zeal. Not only was the food delicious, but it is quite entertaining to watch the people work so hard to accommodate so many - we will definitely return."

"A local recommended R & G for a non-touristy meal in Chinatown and we were not disappointed. We arrived as the lunch rush started, and were asked if our party of 4 was willing to share a table. We said yes, and were soon led upstairs to share a private table with 6 other people. The service was prompt and attentive (quick tea refills and replacement of used plates with clean ones). The clams in black bean sauce was excellent, as was the Szechuan pork (spicy!). The fried rice was sadly on the bland side, but it wasn't greasy as is often the case. The other groups at our table enjoyed the fried crab, lobster, and Peking Duck, all of which looked delicious. We can't wait to come back on our next visit to Chinatown!"
I HAVE NEVER had a bad meal here. Great for large dinner parties and small get togetthers. I recommend this place strongly.
"I'm from NYC.  I'm not Chinese.  But we have very good friends in San Francisco who are Chinese-American.  They take us here for dinner whenever we visit- most recently last week.  Obviously, it helps if the waiters know you and you speak Chinese.  We had the crab-  almost everyone does- incredible.  Peking duck-  superb (the pancakes are very different than we get  in NYC).  Steamed whole fish- delicious.  Scallops with beef with salt and pepper-  amazing.  Add some soup, appetizers, vegetable dishes, fried rice.  Walk away fat and very happy.  Very reasonable prices. Simple atmosphere.  I can only think that the average reviews are because the restaurant might favor locals who come often-  which isn't right but does happen.  Guess we are lucky to have friends who are regulars.  There are lots of good Chinese restaurants in SF-  this one is in Chinatown-  I would go every time I visit."
"We were recommended by a local to try out this restaurant as we heard the food is good. After having hamburger and western foods for almost 10 days, what my family craved for was a simple Chinese meal. We ordered roast duck and a few simple dishes to go with the rice and that was what we want, but the waiter kept recommending crabs, fish and expensive dishes to us. When we rejected his recommendation,  he was very unhappy and passed sarcastic remark in Cantonese which he might think we couldn't understand.  He was hoping to get more gratuity if we have a big bill.   It was really a very disappointing and humiliating experience as we felt very insulted being looked down by the waiter who is a Chinese too.  Even we didn't think the waiter deserved to have, we well certainly could afford to give the tips. After the dinner, we walked out the restaurant with very sad and heavy heart.  No matter how good the food is, we would never want to return to this restaurant again."
We came here as it was recommended to us by a taxi driver. The service was really efficient and the food was good. It's not the sort of place where you would go for the atmosphere but it suited us as we were tired and hungry after a full day touring.
"Came here on recommendation from woman who owned a shop on Chinatown.  Did not have reservations but only waited 15 minutes for a table even though it was a Friday night an a handful of people waiting.
Their signature dish is this salt & pepper Dungeness crab but we found it greasy; however the crab with black bean sauce was amazing.   Messy dish to eat but well worth it. 
If you like Hot & Sour soup its the way to go but on the spicy side...if you want Chinese in SF this the first place to go."
The downstairs is not for romantic couples but the service is fast and the food is delicious.  We were in a bit of a rush and didn't have time for the steamed sea bass but the rock cod with ginger and onions was delicious.  Crab looked good too.
"R & G Lounge was an awesome experience!  Got in the cab headed to House of Nanking, and the driver told us this place was better.  We all loved this restaurant.  The food was authentic and the prices were great.  We will definitely go back!"
"One of the best Chinese meals I've ever had. Amazing menu, fresh ingredients, superb service. Was recommended here by a local food blogger.....definitely did not disappoint. Would definitely recommend"
"R&G Lounge had great authentic Chinese food. I've been to China and have to say this is the closest to it I have ever had here in the states. We were seated very quickly and they immediately brought us hot tea which was delicious. My wife and I ordered vegetable egg rolls and seafood lettuce wraps (shrimp and scallops) as an appetizer and they were both incredible! This place brings their food out family style (on large plates) so the prices seemed a little expensive, but the plates are huge and enough to feed a family. We then ordered our meal of Mongolian Beef and Fried Rice. There were 5 different fried rice options you could get and we ordered just the regular Fried Rice with egg in it. Both were fantastic and authentic. You won't find Chinese take out items here such as General Tso's and Sesame Chicken. Everything on the menu looked and sounded delicious. We were there at 2 in the afternoon and it was still packed. 
The service was fast and efficient, you just have to flag them down if you need something. They don't just come and check on you and see if you need anything. This is why we gave this place a 4 instead of 5. Overall a must try!"
Taken their by our kids and their children.  The food was great from Peking Duck to pot stickers and ribs for the kids.  Not much for looks but food matters.
"This restaurant was recommended by the Argonaut Hotel on Fisherman's Wharf.  A great experience, a bit pricey but the food was great as was the service. There are many many places to eat in Chinatown so we were happy to get some advice and it was well-given. Patrons said it was a great place for lunch in the bustling city."
"The R & G Lounge was recommended by the Bell Captain at the Omni, round the corner, and what a recommendation, it was the finest Chinese restaurant we have been to. Don't be put off by the queue for a table, people are queuing because it is well worth the wait (only 20 minutes). The quality of food and the choice was excellent and the flavours were fantastic. Don't go in for a quick meal, take your time and savour the food. It's a must visit again place."
we were the only Caucasians on our side of this wonderful restaurant. Had been recommended by our hotel but couldn't get in. Glad we made a reservation for another night. Walk ins were being told it was an hour wait.  So glad we got right in with our advanced reservation.  Ordered the signature crab and the best stir fry veggies ever!
"this could have been the BEST Chinese restaurant experience of my life. Service was crisp, warm and caring. The place was full with a warm buzz. The food, as we Californians are apt to say was TO DIE FOR.  Crab in salt and pepper is like nothing ever tried before. The mixed vegetables were tasty, moist and fresh. Rice was prepared to order. 

Recommend reservations to avoid extended waits for a table."
"We were walking around Chinatown and found R&G Lounge.  What a find!!!  The staff was friendly and welcoming. I ordered the brisket and noodle soup, the brisket was so tender and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  My husband had the R&G special beef, it was also delicious and tender.  This easily could be a ""must go"" every time we visit Chinatown. We heard rave reviews for the pepper crab and the spareribs from folks around us...we'll have to try those next time!"
"This is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten at in the US. Everything we ordered was absolutely amazing. Their famous salt and pepper crab was huge, delicious, and unlike any crab I've ever had before. Even the people that I was with who said they didn't like seafood, loved the seafood lettuce wraps. The lamb with steamed buns were really different and amazing. Everything was so flavorful. But the dish that stole the show was the Baked Black Cod. If I lived in San Francisco, I would be ordering that dish for takeout at least once a week. It was perfectly cooked, sweet and savory. Really Amazing. If you're in San Francisco and want a really wonderful Chinese meal, you must go to R & G Lounge!"
"Very good place to eat in Chinatown. The crab is huge and very juicy, a bit greasy as well though. The tofu we had was awesome. The restaurant personnel was friendly. Anytime again."
"Years ago I watched Anthony Bourdain rave about R&G's salt and pepper crab and decided that this was a must stop/must eat on an upcoming trip to SF.  I've had it 4 times now and each time has been a memorable meal.  From walking through Chinatown, to navigating through the small and crowded aisles of the restaurant, to the final delivery of that order- unforgettable. I've also tried the special beef and the scallops- both were great.  However... disclaimer... the last two times I have ordered the crab, I found it overly-greasy. 

We have never visited when there wasn't a line outside of the door, so I highly advise reservations. 

Additionally, our service was well below par on our last visit.  This included a wrong order and over-charging by $25, which ultimately was not resolved, despite the involvement of a supervisor, and concluded with us giving up and just paying the check.  Hmmphhh.  After that experience, my husband stated that he would prefer to never go back.  But the fact is, the crab is just that good... I may have to ask him to reconsider."
"Originally, my friend and I were going to Pacific Court Restaurant (Chinese American cuisine)  However, for some reasons, He drove his Lexus and picked up me up at the last moment for another restaurant.  ""Where are we going?""  ""R&G Lounge!"" He replied in an excited voice!  ""Oh, Great choice!"" (having been there many a time)

Surprise!  My friend made a reservation for two at 6:30 pm.  Not too long we were directed to our table on the first floor.  R&G Lounge has a basement and a 2nd floor dining area and a private room, having patronized this place.

We ordered dishes:  a soy sauce chicken (great tasting), a seafood/tofu claypot, a seafood soup and walnut stir fried shrimp.  They were all tasty, splendid, and impressive presentations by the servers.  The soup presented was service hot, but not too hot to drink.  The servers were constantly checking with us on our needs.

Excellent customer services! Excellent food!  Can not go wrong!"
"Best crab ever, hands down. Started of with some cold appetizers followed by a doubled boiled soup and finished by a trilogy of Alaskan King Crab cooked 3 ways.

The joint parts were stir fried with egg yolk which was finger licking good. Legs were steamed with minced garlic and topped with a season soy sauce and garnished with green onion. Remaining  parts were steam in egg which was very well seasoned.

Although I have to admit that the service really depends on if/who you know, but in general is OK.

Would definitely return and a must visit if you are in San Francisco."
Extremely busy and reservations are suggested but the wait is worth it. The R&G Special Beef was outstanding. Service is quick and wait staff are attentive.
"Don't pass by this restaurant. It is not inviting from the outside, and the work lounge is a little off-putting, but food is excellent. Everyone eating in the restaurant was Asian, and the restaurant had been recommended by Asian friends at home. 

We ordered hot & sour soup, Mongolian Beef, Shrimp with Walnuts, and R&G Special Beef. Soup was excellent. Entrees were large and filling. Each was excellent. Definitely would go again."
"went to R & G on advice of the valet at the Hilton and we were not disappointed. It has a fun atmosphere and several large tanks with lobsters and fish. We ordered duck soup, egg rolls, honey walnut shrimp and xo steak. Egg rolls are the best we have ever had! Duck soup is unique and savory. Everything cooked to perfection and piping hot.
The one odd thing is that the food just randomly arrives and my soup came about 5 minutes before the egg rolls. Be light hearted and it's like a surprise of what comes next
Many people were eating very large fried crabs."
"My husband & I went to R & G's on a recommendation from Thai at Kensington Park. He was on the money! The food is delicious, the service was a little slow but not to bad. The food definaltley made up for the initial slow service."
Go! This place was awesome. 4 of us got different things so we could share. The girls got rice dishes and the guys ordered entrees. Pay attention to the name tags too! We got a good laugh bc of them
I love R & G and always go when I am in SF area. The regular menu prices are a bit pricey but the lunch menu is a great deal. I love the honey spare ribs!!!
"The Dungeness Crab is the best, do not pass it by...  But dress casually it is messy and worth every bite. Peking Duck is also one of the best items on the menu. Kid friendly!"
"However, I remember coming here before online rating sites, when I first graduated college and worked in DTSF.  As a recent graduate, there were so many Chinese places we could go, and it wouldn't be hard on our pocketbooks.  Now, several years after I moved from No CA to So CA, I am glad to see R & G is still around

I had lunch w/ my Sis who works in the City.  We ordered the octopus & beef cold platter ($10), beef chow fun ($10), and of course, the signature Salt & Pepper Crab (mkt price - $45).

The cold platter was very good.  The baby octopus were tender and nicely seasoned.  The same goes for the beef.  It was way better compared to most Chinese banquet versions:  Both 5 Stars.

Secondly, the chow fun was also very good.  The noodles didn't stick together and there was plenty of meat:  4 Stars.

Lastly, the piece de resistance signature crab was cray!!!  The meat was so tender and the head was so flavorful, I was in creaven (crustacean heaven)!  I worked through cracking all the shells, and enjoying the delectable meat.  I only had one spoonful of rice so I could enjoy the wonderful meat:  5+++ Stars.

The ambiance is way better than I remember.  Back in the day, you walked down in the dungeon, ate your food and left.  Now there is a bar up top, and it looks all loungey:  5 Stars.

The service was really good for a Chinese place.  All the staff was professionally dressed, polite, and spoke English well:  5 Stars.

R & G is a definite must if you are in SF Chinatown.  It has survived because of the excellent seafood, very good other Cantonese dishes, and updating the ambiance.  Make sure you order the salt & pepper crab though.  Its that good!!!"
"We had a fantastic meal here whilst on holiday. The place was full of Chinese which made me realise  how good it must be. Menu is in Chinese so I explained what we like and had a few recommendations from waiter. Food was delicious. If you like being adventurous
then this is the right place to go."
"The Dungeness Crab is the best, do not pass it by...  But dress casually it is messy and worth every bite. Peking Duck is also one of the best items on the menu. Kid friendly!"
"During a recent visit to San Francisco we asked the Hotel Concierge at the Vitale for a Chinese restaurant recommendation and this was one of 4 on the hotel list. During a 3 week driving holiday with friends on the west coast this was without doubt the worst restaurant we dined in. We were initially served tea and my wife had a leaking cup which spread over the table, rather than change the table cloth the waiter simply put some napkins over the soaking table cloth. Food arrived at intermittent intervals, we were certainly not made feel welcome which was confirmed when the waiters not only cleared other tables around us but actually moved them out of the dining room. The food was very average. We would not have been surprised had the painter and decorators turned up!!"
We went for lunch and were surprised at the prices. Then our local friend asked for the lunch menu and voila! we saw the same meals at luncheon prices. They obviously get many tourists who don't know to ask for the lunch menu - you should! The food is excellent and reasonably priced for lunch off the luncheon menu.
"I was passing by and decided to try this place, because of the crowd. So I figured it had to be good lol . first I went next door and got a neck back and foot massage. The price was fantastic. Then I came here and yess the food was spectacular and the sake did it's job on me. ...San Francisco I love this city via Memphis 10. ...."
"This restaurant was recommend by my friends and I am so glad we tried it out before leaving San Francisco. It is on the outskirts of proper Chinatown and they do provide parking at a lot nearby for 2 hours. Menu offers excellent choices and they make dishes you will not find in the usual Chinese restaurants. Their tofu was excellent and they had squab which I never see on a menu and it was done perfectly. I have not had squab since my dad died in 97. Their fried oysters were incredibly huge and so delicious. The garlic eggplant  was also done well. I called my friends to give them our positive reviews and when we return to San Francisco, we plan to have dinner there together. I can't wait to return and try some other dishes."
"I visited this restaurant while on vacation this past May, the food was excellent , the wait was worth it. I believe what we ordered was called special beef and it really was just that.... special, we also ordered fried rice and that was amazing as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the bay area that loves Chinese food the way we do."
"This was our first meal on our recent West Coast road trip.  We'd had a long travel day and were looking for a quick fill.  The restaurant was very busy but we got seated straight away as we were only a party of 2.  The food was unbelievably good, although it came out at really odd times, one starter, then the next starter with a main course, then the rice, then another main course ect.  the food was pretty pricey too but it tasted so good we didn't care!  definitely worth giving the place a go."
"I asked a local where I should eat in Chinatown and this was the answer. This is not a dive. It's a very nicely kept place with good service and solid food. I knew I was going to be alright when I walked up and there was a sidewalk full of locals waiting for a table on a Tuesday night. The menu was expansive and I settled for the Spring Rolls with smoked salmon and avocado and then a main entree of seafood clay pot (scallops, prawns, clams, and bean curd) with white rice. The seafood was fresh and all came out piping hot. I would highly recommend this place."
"First off, it is not your inexpensive neighborhood Chinese restaurant!  But that does not keep the place from being packed! The food is the answer. Fresh original takes on classics you think you know. Others you likely can figure out but with a thrill of exploration. We loved it and we're happy it was part of our San Fransisco trip."
"The reviews of this place in China town were good so we decided to give it a go for lunch.  Price was OK as were most of the dishes, the Sate however was probably the worst I've ever had.  Dried up chicken and beef that looked and tasted like it was re constituted with a brown gravy like substance that bore no resemblance to Sate sauce.   We won't be visiting again and I can't for the life of me fathom how they managed to get into the Michelin Guide for 2014 (although they are not recommended)"
"A great place for authentic Chinese food!  The food is a showcase of Cantonese food, which is all about fresh/best ingredients with their original tastes.  The only thing I am wondering is maybe better tea can be served to pair up with the high- quality food."
"Had the salt & pepper squid & Kung Pao chicken, both were fantasitc. Squid was the best we have ever had naywhere!!! Didnt have the crab like Tony Bourdain did, as I woudl have had to pig out on it all myself as the other half doesnt eat it, but mightily impressed!!"
"Walk in no need to book, however this was a Wednesday evening even so it was packed and as soon as a table became free it was quickly filled. The food was excellent, the best duck I've ever had, overall the whole meal was perfect. priced well too"
"There are seemingly endless options in Chinatown, but our hotel concierge steered us towards R&G. We arrived at lunch time on a weekday and were seated straight away. We ordered the special beef and the black cod, as well as some pak choi and egg fried rice. The beef was excellent, the cod quite nice too, but it seemed overpriced (4 times more expensive than the beef!).

What was annoying is that all the food came at very different times. Even the rice! The cod took particularly long to come out and it was only when we complained that they mentioned it takes 30 min to prepare in the oven. This should have been mentioned when ordering.

Apart from the beef, this meal was nothing special. Service was pretty abrupt as you expect to find in a Chinatown restaurant. Our bill came to $90, which seemed high, but this was largely due to the cod. I'm not sure we would return here."
"Hotel staff recommended. We did not have reservations, but we went  early evening, 6-ish. Not much to see when one first enters, but downstairs is packed with locals. Service is very good, prompt, & attentive. Food is fantastic! Be prepared to share. We shared the Lamb in Spicy Sauce with magnificent steamed buns and the half order Ginger & Green Onion Chicken. Overall given service, food, and Chinese environment. I have to go 5-stars."
"We had heard about this place fro the concierge  at the Ritz Carlton Residence as a place to walk to for takeout but did Italian (pizza etc delivery instead). After a futile happy hour oyster hunt we hit this place and were happy to have done so. It is a Chinese restaurant with an almost entirely Asian clientele. We ordered a whole Peking Duck, the house specialty Salt and Pepper Crab, an eggplant dish and a steamed rice..

The Peking duck was brought out carved on a large platter with the crispy skin removed from the flesh and served on top. there was a bowl of Hoisin and a dish of julienned green onion. Rather than the thin rice pancakes I had become used to o the east coast, the vehicle for the duck and accouterments here were steamed buns. 
The Salt and Pepper Crab was a huge Dungeness with the claws removed from the body, breaded and deep fried the upper shell was also breaded and deep fried with the mustard left inside. It was visually impressive, difficult to get meat out of but a nonetheless worthwhile endeavor.

the Eggplant dish was unspectacular, a bit on the bland side with large pieces of eggplant in a translucent sauce.
The price for the three dishes and the bowl of rice was $130+ which I thought a bit excessive."
"We stopped in here on recommendation of the your we were on. This was certainly the popular choice, the place was packed!  We sat downstairs &  ordered the lunch BBQ with duck & chilled beef and a braised pork wonton soup with noodles. The duck was pretty good, but the rest of the meal was pretty bland. Maybe we just didn't know what to order though. The server was really great, the food just left something to be desired."
"Didn't have the famous crab, but dinner was awesome.  Make reservations as the wait can be lengthy without one.
Try the lychee martini, yum yum."
This was without doubt one of the best Chinese meals we have ever had.  The Salt and Pepper Crab is to die for.  Just go there for that and you will not be disappointed.  We did not speak to each other 15 minutes while we ate every piece.  Do yourself a favour if you are into Chinese and make this a stop on your trip.
Didn't sound like a Chinese restaurant but the food was very good and portions are big. Service was good too! I would recommend this place.
We attempted to visit this restaurant. We had on jeans and the lady told us that was not OK. While we were on the sidewalk trying to decide where else to go several asian customers (wearing jeans) walked in and were seated. Not sure if it was us or that we had teens/children with us.
"Service was a little slow but it may have been due to the fact that they were full and people were waiting at the reception and outside.  Really good flavor, abundant, delicious."
"You would easily pass this by as a bit of a dump, but look at the queues !
This place is packed every night and no wonder. The food is excellent, closer to traditional Chinese but very recognisable and all very tasty. Crab, lobster, beef great vegetables and duck. Very quick service and at reasonable prices, booking advised."
"They have their fresh seafood, and for those of you who love beef their house beef special its very good too. Their Leychee martinis are to die for !!!!

The only bad thing its the parking sucks but if you park at the parking lot across from the Hilton Hotel they will validate your parking ticket for up to 2 hrs."
"The food was by far the best Chinese I've had in a very long time. The ambiance is pretty laid back and the service we received was pretty good. We especially loved the avocado spring rolls-- absolutely delicious! For our main entrees we go shrimp fried rice and seafood lo mien. Very yummy! It's the family style set up, so the portions are huge and made for sharing. With the name ""lounge"" I was expecting something more posh, but like I said earlier it is very laid back. It's pretty popular among locals, so we were happy to try it out. Definitely recommend!"
"We were hosted by locals which made this an easy dining experience.  The signature crab was extremely fresh and very tasty, the black salted cod was rich and flavoursome, the peking duck was different to what we have experienced in the past but just as tasty, the honey/garlic ribs were delicious, the greens were good to cut through the richness of everything else.  The lychee martinis were quite sweet but very tasty.  The place was humming at 6:30pm on a Wednesday night and full of asians - always a good sign - and when we left there were long queues out on the pavement for the second sitting.  Just go for the food and I can't think you would be disappointed."
"I imagine that the other Chinatown restaurants have similar fare to this one in terms of chicken, duck etc (which were fantastic) but the crab sets this place apart. It is a must try, we went here twice during our visit."
"R&G Lounge is a very good place to visit for excellent Chinese food you may not see elsewhere.

The signature dish is the Salt and Pepper Dungeness crab.  It's at ""market price"" which turned out to be about $45. We shared it among two and with another, vegetable dish and soup the amount of food was fine.  The crab is actually delicious - you want to eat both the batter and the crab inside.  Our service was attentive and friendly.

A few tips:

-The hot and sour soup is also very good and flavorful
-They have lychee martinis that have a wonderful, subtle taste and are great if you want to try something new
-The crab is basically a finger food and there's no ""neat"" way to eat it.  They give you plenty of napkins and cleaning wipes, however, so just dig in and enjoy it
-This isn't really a tourist place, it's frequented mostly by locals, which we viewed as a plus"
"We went here only because we ""heard"" or read to something that we HAD to go here. I've travelled a lot ... and eaten at a lot of different places ... and I have to say that I absolutely do not see the hype in this place. The food was ok, service was not great, atmosphere was poor (our table was right at the top of the stairs to the second dining room so we had a constant flow of traffic, and we were constantly forgotten about by the wait staff) ... have to say that this is not somewhere that I would say people must go to eat at in San Francisco. I am sure there have got to be better Chinese food places than this."
"Had to go there for the salt and pepper Dungeoness crab, and it was as delicious as it looked. The wait staff was very attentive, and I felt they let us enjoy our meal at her own pace. I'm still dreaming about how delicious the crab was."
"Not exactly cheap, but not very pricey. Food quality is excellent and service is good. Will come back when in SF again."
"We had a wonderful lunch at the R and G. A small meal of snow peas and Peking duck. The food was fresh  and quick and delicious. Our waiter was attentive. Heads up, a small bowl of rice is $2.  We had a ginger lobster here for dinner the other day and it was really good.  Definitely recommend the ginger lobster. Next time we will try their signature crab dish."
The signature dish at this restaurant is the salt and pepper crab.  It's the first time I had it and it was wonderful.....finger licking good!  You pay market price for this dish and it was $45 at the end of August.  But it was worth it if you love crab.  We also tried the Ma Po Bean Curd which was ok.  The Pan-Fried Minced Pork and Salted Fish Patty was also something I've never had before and it was also very good.  Our last dish was the Ginger & Green Onion Chicken (half order).  This dish is a steamed chicken served in ginger & green onion sauce.  The sauce seemed to have been put through a blender and the dish was quite tasty.  The service was very good.  It is best to make a reservation here because it can get crowded.  It's one of the nicer restaurants in Chinatown and quite popular with the locals.  We had four dishes for four people plus rice.  We probably should have ordered a vegetable dish but we were full.
"Neither love or hate it. I went for dinner and this place is packed, however the service was great. I wanted to try their signature salt and pepper crab but it was outside of my budget.
I tried their roasted squab and their seafood fried rice. The squab was tasty and crunchy but a bit pricey for what you get. The seafood fried rice was a disaster. It was just white rice mixed with oil and frozen seafood. I did not see that it was even properly fried.
It seems to be a nice place to go with friends to have a quick snack and have some drinks. Maybe also try their signature crab dish but that would be it."
"The food was delicious however a bit pricey.  The linens are changed between guests.  The waiters are run off their feet, but also work together to clear tables or bring out the food.  we did a family style except for the soup.  We all shared our portions, smallish for sharing, but all the food was good."
"I thought their prices were high, but the food was not any better than what we get at Sunny Wok, 8756 E State Road 70, Bradenton, FL 34202"
We went here 5 years ago and loved it.  We kept returning.  This last visit the chicken was chewy and the service was BAD.
"We were recommended R&G lounge by one of our hotel's staff and we were very happy. We visited at lunchtime, without a reservation when it was extremely busy but we didn't wait long before being shown to our table. The food was very tasty and reasonably priced with a good selection of dishes on the menu."
"Recommended by many, so we tried it for lunch. Order one plate per person. We had the honey chicken and broccoli, BBQ beef, cashew chicken (not great) and Chinese bacon and broccoli dishes. Enjoyed most of them. Our particular server was average but the others looked good. Would go back again."
"R & G Lounge (631 Kearny St., San Francisco, CA 94108, tel. 415-982-7877, www.rnglounge.com). We had a wonderful Cantonese meal and were very happy. We shared three dishes, all of them very good. We had the Steamed Clams with Eggs ($18) that we loved when we had it in Hong Kong. It was a very good rendition and R & G. We had Three Treasures with Black Bean Sauce ($15) described as bean curd, eggplant, hot peppers with shrimp meat in black bean sauce. The flavors were delicious as were the bean curd and eggplant tastes. The third dish we ordered was the Roasted Squab for $16 (described as whole squab roasted to a golden brown crispy skin, served with seasonings on the side). The squab was crispy and succulent and we loved it. We spent $57.10 plus tip and were very satisfied. For dessert, Dimitri found a perfect sesame ball at a local bakery for $1."
"Reasonably priced, better than average Chinese cuisine (though by no means spectacular), and decent (even if a bit spotty) service. It worked for our young grandchildren and for my wife and me (not always an easy combination feat!).

We didn't necessarily intend to go to R and G --- we had to run an errand in the Chinatown area of SF and asked a shopkeeper what he'd recommend and without hesitation he produced R and G's business card. The recommendation worked!"
"We brought out-of-state friends to visit San Fran, parked in a garage at Kearny and Pine, and randomly asked one of the parking garage attendants what they recommended for Chinese food. He told us R&G, which was just down the street. His recommendation was right on! This was perhaps the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. We particularly enjoyed the Peking duck, and their signature beef dish was sublime. We enjoyed ordering a number of dishes and sharing them, so we all tried everything.
This is a pricy place, but we and our friends agreed that it was a worth-it vacation splurge. We found service to be helpful and friendly, and we weren't rushed as some reviewers have noted. We were there for late lunch, so that's probably why we had a different experience from the dinner crowd. The restaurant was nearly full, but our group of 7 had no wait at lunch time. 
I have visited Hong Kong, and the atmosphere here reminded me so much of that place. No windows, and with a lively crowd (translation: noisy), which is typical of Hong Kong restaurants. People in HK live in small apartments, with no room for entertaining, so restaurants are their living rooms, where they eat, laugh loudly, and socialize together. Don't expect a quiet meal. Instead, embrace the chaos and enjoy it.
From the restaurant we had an easy walk to Chinatown and enjoyed the rest of our day."
"This is probably the best Chinese food in the entire city.  It looks very small and unassuming from the outside, and is easy to miss. The inside, though, is opulent. Not only is the decoration and ambience unforgettable, but the important part is the amazing food.  All their food is incredible.  Every dish I had was a pleasure. A true hidden treasure of the city."
"The place was jammed, but they honored our reservation, and gave us a satisfactory table.    We couldn't wait to try Dungeness crabs, Chinese style.    In was a large portion but heavily breaded and a little greasy but tasty and different.    Garlic noodles with seafood was excellent, as was Chinese broccoli with sausage and bacon.    The Mai Tai's were disappointing, tasting 
Iike fruit punch.      Nonetheless, we enjoyed our dinner, feeling like we had delicious Chinese food that we had not tasted before."
"R&G Lounge used to represent the epitome of authentic Chinese food in SF Chinatown featuring their famous Crab Tempura dish.  However the last time our family dined there, we found the customers were primarily non-Asian tourists who were willing to wait in hour long lines to eat at R&G Lounge.  While I am happy for their success, I found that the portions of their dishes became smaller and the prices higher and being rushed through dinner to turnover the table did not bode well.  We had six dishes and noodles for 5 adults and two kids and with a bottle of $34.00 wine for an average label, our bill came to $230 including tax and tip.  The priciest dish we ordered was the 1/2 order of Peking Duck so go figure.  The dishes continue to be tasty but, there are too many other choices around SF Chinatown that serve equally good food to have to endure these high prices.  I wouldn't be so upset if their portions were not so small that our group left hungry."
"Heard many good things about this place from guidebooks as well as by word of mouth. Insanely crowded but I made  a reservation a few weeks prior to our visit. We arrived a little early and the harried receptiinists took our name. We sat at the bar and had a couple of great martinis. Much to my surprise we were seated in main dinning room promptly at our reserved time. Fast service. We had the signature dish fried salt and pepper Dungeness crab, half a peking duck, and bok choy w mushrooms.  All was well prepared well served hot and tasty however a bit greasy for our taste.   Loud noisy and crowded.  Does not necessarily live up to the bype.  Probably not wort a multi hour wait if you did not make a reservation"
"It was a girls night out for us. I was very surprised the restaurant was very crowded on a Monday evening.

All the tables were full and the server can’t wait to send us out of the door when we finished the food. Without us asking, he just places the bill in front of us while removing the last empty plate on the table. When we told him that we have not been asked about dessert, his reply was there is no dessert tonight. Wow! 

The food was decently good for what we ordered. We had the miso black cod, salt and pepper crab, braised duck wings, sweet sour pork ribs, clay pot beef and a green vegetable Dou Miao. Of all the dishes, I like the miso black cod most. The salt and pepper crab was tasty but I didn't expect it to be coated with batter when we made the order. For low carb eater- order the steam crab.

The complimentary soup was filled with MSG. So we avoided it. Makes me think that the rest of the food might have some MSG too.

With the hurry-pay-up and please-leave treatment, I wouldn't bring my husband to this restaurant. If you want to have time catching up with friends over dinner at this place, eat at a slower pace and order the food as you go in order to have more time. If you like the quick service, eat and run, this might be the place to give a try."
"This is just great Chinese food. Authentic and good.

We had mu-shu pork, kung pow chicken and R&G beef (unreal) and a great bottle of wine all for a 100 bucks.

Service is quick and fun and the atmosphere is pure Hong Kong. Super good place. Great for out of towers and guests to the city. Loved it!!!"
"This was my second visit over several years and I was not disappointed with the Salt and Pepper Crab, it was after all the reason I visited again on my recent trip to SF. Ambience was utilitarian, the server was friendly and efficient. The wait was long and a reservation does always spare you the wait. I recommend having a drink while you wait. We did and enjoyed our conversations with the other diners in waiting.
Next time I am in The City I will eat here again."
"This is an update from my previous review. Made a reservation 2 weeks prior, but still had to wait. I don't my waiting, but the very rude young host was seating the walk-in's first. Total confusion!
        Had the salt & pepper crab, for a pricy $45.00. It was smaller than last time I dined here. Also, I noticed, some crabs were larger. The large, and meaty oysters with ginger and onions were very good. So was the seafood clay pot. This place used to be a WOW place for me. Now, it's o'kay
         Maybe, I'll return. Could just be an off day."
"Located in Chinatown is one of the best chinese restaurants that I have eaten at.  Great value and great food.  Try the R & G Special Beef you will not be disappointed.  The people at the next table strongly recommended the Salt and Pepper Live Dungeness Crab.  Service was quick and friendly, portions were generous."
"Very poor service in fact total chaos. Food arrived in a haphazard fashion backed up with a total disrespect for customer service. 
Would not recommend this outlet .
The food was below the standard of back home in England.
We understand this is the norm for Chinese in San Francisco 

M"
The food here was excellent!!! Have spent time in Asia and the food was authentic Chinese cuisine. The restaurant itself was quite loud with many people waiting for tables.
"1)The whole team came from Hong Kong to Bay Area 30 years ago and maintaining a good chinese restaurant for 30 years requires a LOT of work.
2)I have been dining in R&G for over 20 years and the quality of service and food haven't change a bit.
3)They didn't offer 200 different dishes, they just focused on the best. 
4)Yelp, Michelin, Anthony Bourdain, Tripadvisor, Jackie Chan, Michelle Obama, give this place 2 thumbs up. you know what I mean.
5)One thing I suggest is gather 10-12 good friends, order 10-12 different dishes then you will have the best chinese food experience in DA USA. I mean it. trust me."
Went by myself the first time and I order the crab and vegetable trio I did not have to wait because it was just one person so I was able to sat at the bar otherwise the wait would have been obout 45 minutes to an hour. The second day we return with my wife and the calamari just melted in my mouth.  One of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever dined at. Every minute we waited was worth it
"Crab time! CRAB time! Get the Crab! Can you tell I like the crab? :)

Although tourists frequent this place as much as the SF natives, this place is legit, good Chinese food. If you come during dinner rush hour, be prepared to wait and they won't seat you unless your entire party is there.

Enjoy the crab! :)"
"Amazing traditional Chinese food! Great preparation, try the fried crab which is a house specialty and an unforgettable choice! Service is prompt and the prices are not bad at all! Would definitely go back!"
"We really enjoyed our meal-order the cod, and a lychee martini! Service was a bit slow, but the restaurant was packed. Reserve or you will be waiting a while. Will definitely go back!"
simply excellent food only slightly compromised by rather aggressive (by british standards) service really this is worth a visit if your in town. you may have to wait - but its worth it - you may have to share a table - its worth it - you may consume a few thousand calories - its worth it. one of the very best. highly recommended
"We didn't go for the crab. We dodged in here as it was open on a night when, unaccountably, a lot of other Chinatown restaurants were shut (at 9pm!) What happened was amazement at how superior the cooking here actually is. We live in London and experience superlative cuisine from many regions of China. But R&G Lounge excelled in their treatment of vegetables such as aubergine, and in their finessing of dishes with fish and duck. We found the wait staff patient and pleasant, the atmosphere buzzy and the dining sumptuous. There's a venerable feel to this place and I hope it's still here the next time we roll through this city of hills and thrills."
"We were walking through Chinatown and were unsure where to eat, though many people pass out menus saying that their ""restaurant is very good"" in broken English. We had no clue, so we went into one of the many trinket stores and asked the cashier for her recommendation (after buying something of course). She said ""AAAAAAANNNNNJJJJAAAYYYY"". We asked her to write it down and she wrote ""R+G"" on an old receipt for us.

The place is not much on the outside. Inside looked very busy, but small. It turned out that there are three levels, so it's not small at all. We started out with Hot and Sour soup which was very good. The service started getting spotty until we complained, then it got consistently good. I think they got their signals crossed or something.

They brought out meals separately, not together and without rice. You have to order rice separately for $7. Two of the three meals we ordered were spicy and my 10-year-old daughter couldn't eat them and of course the chicken chow mein came out much later than the spicy stuff. I'm not sure if this was a mistake or if meals always come out the second they are ready. I like the idea of ""from wok to table"", but this can get inconvenient when not everyone is served at the same time.

The food was excellent, and once they realized who was responsible for our table, the service was good as well. The place was FULL of Chinese folks too which was a good sign."
"Food was OK I've had much tastier. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which was suppose to be spicy, there were three dried peppers with no spice in the dish at all. The dish had a lot of chicken hardly any vegetables. My wife opted for a vegetarian dish which was just OK according to her. In summary the service was quick and attentive from the waiters. However we felt like Caucasian outcasts when first greeted by hostess. She attended in Chinese to three parties that came in after us while we stood there like boobies with no acknowledgement back to us as to the status of our table. My wife wanted to walk out but I insisted that we stay and try it. Bottom line we should have walked out !! This place is overrated ....."
"The Restaurant was very busy...which is a great sign when eating out!!
We made reservations after a friend recommended this place to us. We had out of town friends that we had never met coming to dine with myself and a friend. We were seated promptly, the food arrived hot and delicious. The wait staff was attentive without being overly so. Our entire party really enjoyed our choices, including the fried crab...very different and also very good. A family oriented restaurant that was pleasant for four adults.  The wait staff was kind enough to take our picture so that we will always remember our visit. I will not hesitate to return to R and G Lounge!!"
"What you are stuck with is batter and crabshell. 
The Peking duck is full of bones, and some 'american pancake' style 

Don't spend money here."
Service is good even though the restaurant is totally packed from the minute they open until they close. A local couple who flew on the same flight recommended us this restaurant; definitely worth the walking from Union Square to Chinatown.
"i called and tried to make a reservation but they only take a certain number, after that you have to stand in line. when we arrived the line looked long but it moved fast and we only had to wait perhaps 20 mins.
we were seated in the basement level which is probably the least attractive part of the restaurant but it was still pleasant and the whole place definitely had a buzz around it.
we ordered a couple of appetizers and some vegetable dishes, all were good but i can't even remember what they were, all i can remember is the crab!
i don't know how some flour, salt and pepper can make a crab taste so much better but whatever it is they've mastered it at r&g lounge. the best crab we've ever had, hands down. 
i'm still thinking about it three weeks later, go to r&g lounge and eat salt and pepper crab!!!!"
"R & G had some of the best chinese seafood i've had.  We had the whole crab 3 ways.  The Salt and Pepper and garlic pepper were my favorites.  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  Even the basics like Kung Pao chicken where great.  Bif groups, reservation recommended.  Smaller groups will still have to wait, but it is pretty quick turnover."
"Be prepared to wait awhile for a table during peak hours.  My husband and I ate here for dinner and we were told that the wait would be an hour.  So we put our names on the list and grabbed some drinks at the bar which was conveniently located in the waiting area.  We ended up sharing a round table with 4 other strange couples so that we could be seated immediately.  So actual wait time was half an hour.  Service was very prompt.  We ordered the crunchy style chow mein with prawns and veggies and the roasted duck.  The chow mein was good but there were hardly any veggies in the dish.  Maybe a little bok choy.  The roasted duck was really fatty, but delicious!  So flavorful!  If you are jonesing for chinese food, this is the place!"
"We expected good food from the recommendations for this place, and was not disappointed. Very efficient service, the food came fast, but be aware that it may be very noisy (the max allowed no of persons was violated...). There was a long line of customers waiting, so it may be a good advise to make a reservation like we did."
"Having lived in Hong Kong on and off for a few years, I believe there are a few hallmarks for a good Chinese restaurant:
-	It’s full of Chinese people
-	The sound level is high
-	The atmosphere feels near chaotic for a westerner
-	Everyone is stuffing themselves
And so we come to the R & G Lounge, which easily fulfils all these criteria.  We tripped over this place one Saturday afternoon around 3pm with hunger pangs.  The place was packed to the rafters (in the middle of the afternoon!) and dishes whisked around our heads on their way to other tables with tantalising smells wafting behind them.  Service was efficient, functional and perfectly adequate; in such a busy place I wouldn’t expect more.  
We were blown away by the food, especially the lamb slices served with steamed buns (a kind of do-it-yourself pancake roll-up except the pancake is a pure white, oval bun-puff).  We also had Szechwan something (it was a few days ago), mixed vegetables and tofu, and steamed rice (not on the menu).  All delicious.  Highly recommended.  

Suggestion: Go in with the knowledge that you are entering a different country."
"We tried two Chinese restaurants whilst in San Francisco, one only had European dinners and was very average, the other the R and G lounge was full of Chinese dinners and was very good.  I am sure there is a clue there somewhere.  We hadn't booked but they managed to squeeze us in, unfortunately next to the cashier desk, however the food more than made up for it.  We ordered two bowls of their hot and sour soup followed by two of the restaurant's specialities, a beef and a chicken dish plus a small mountain of rice. All were delicious and the service very good. Well worth a trip."
"As a visitor I tend to ask people that live in the area for restaurant advice. We were spending the morning walking through China Town and planned to eat lunch before heading back to the hotel so we checked for recommendations. Bless the person that recommended R&G! We arrived a couple of minutes before noon and the restaurant was almost empty, but filled up within minutes with mostly local clientele. The food was great! Flavors were fresh and perfectly prepared. We could not have asked for better service. Fast, efficient, but not obtrusive. The restaurant was immaculate and that is important to me. Great visit and I would definitely recommend."
Had reservations and was expecting terrific things.  Felt very rushed by staff to order.  Decided on spring rolls and salt and pepper spare ribs.  Just deep fried nastiness without any flavor whatsoever.  Staff didn't really seem to care either.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place!
"Being Chinese, it's fair to say I know Chinese food.  This restaurant serves authentic cuisine with high quality and flavor with the usual low service.  If you order the typical ""American"" Chinese dishes like previous reviewers-you will most likely be disappointed."
"A tour guide recommended this restaurant to us so we walked through China town to find it.  The food wasnt bad.  We sat at a ""community"" table since we didnt have a reservation and that was fun.  It was $75 for three people.  We ate the food and it was OK.  I was not blown away by it though.  Was expecting more after the hype the guide was pushing.  Oh well."
"I had several friends recommend this restaurant to me and we were not disappointed!  Very busy and I would recommend a reservation. There were four of us and together we had Salt and Pepper Crab, Peking Duck, Short Ribs, Seafood Fried Rice, Ling Cod and Pea Shoots.  All were excellent.  The pea shoots are not on the menu, but be sure to ask for them.  Prices are very average, with exception of the crab.  It was market price at $43.00. We shared.  The other dishes ran between $15-20. I would go back tomorrow if we were still there.  One member of our party who is half Chinese said this was very authentic."
"Noisy, Busy, Mediocre Food and Rude Waiters.
So noisy my friends and me could not have a conversation. The place was so busy, waiters kept running around and dropping utensils and dishes all over the place. 
Waiter brought the wrong order to one one my friends and insisted that's what she had ordered. I ordered duck and never got my dish... When I inquired about it, the waiter told me I had never ordered it... Rude, rude, rude.
The food was mediocre and cold when we FINALLY got it...."
"We asked at one of the toy/gift shops in Chinatown if they could recommend a good Chinese restaurant. They recommended here & we are so glad they did! We had to wait for a table but just ordered some drinks & waited at the bar. Very friendly & accommodating service. We ordered egg rolls & BBQ pork for starters - both very tasty. Then special beef, scallops beef & macadamia nuts, & honey ginger chicken for our mains. All beautiful but the beef with scallops was particularly tender. Couldn't quite finish it all but it really was a beautiful meal. Worth the wait!!"
We arrived mid afternoon in SF looking to eat Chinese food. We were informed by the concierge that most Chinese restaurants close between lunch and dinner but to try R and G. Both tourists and locals were enjoying some great food. What we ordered was very very good.
"R&G is one of my family's favorite Cantonese restaurants.   It is conveniently located in Chinatown/Financial District and within easy walking distance from BART  

When it comes to Chinese food, my family would expect high quality family style cooking,  low sodium, low fat, no MSG to name a few requirements.  The waiters have always offered their honest opinions. If we strive for low fat yet attempting to order the signature disk salt and pepper crabs, they would suggest another cooking method. .

Some of my favorite dishes include the beef brisket in a clear broth,  signature style beef and their egg white and dried scallop fried rice.   You should try them all!

Also,  this restaurant offers 2 hrs free parking at Portsmouth Sq Parking (one block away)for  spending $50 per meal.    

Another good tip: their lunch special is a good bargain (offered week days only)."
"Okay, it's always crowded, and you may have to wait. Yes, the downstairs dining room looks like a basement makeover from the sixties. But the food.... always the food. We had the Salt and Pepper Deep Fried Crab. No reason to live, but food to die for, if you know what I mean. We also had oysters with ginger and scallions--a tough dish to get right, but they always do. Their garlic eggplant was a stand-out too. The bar (a great place to hang out while your waiting, if small) produces things like lychee and pear martinis--both delightful. Service is attentive. Atmosphere can be a little loud. But it's all worth it. It's on our must-visit list when we're in town."
"On our recent trip to San Fransico we visited the fantastic China Town.
Looking for somewhere to eat we were spoit for choice with hundreds of  Restaurants all over the place ,not knowing good from bad.
My wife then happened upon a Chinese guy on his hands and knees scrapping chewing gum from the pavement ! 
She asked where's good to eat and he recommended R&G Lounge.
After a little walk and with help of a phone app we found it and sat down to a feast.  
Whilst ordering the waiter told us  that in his view we had ordered too much ,so we took his advice and ordered accordingly .
The food was really good and plenty full and cooked fresh and was more than enough.
The seating area was downstairs and was packed with local Chinese people ,always a good sign.
Try and see for authentic Chinese food in bustling China Town"
"The best Chinese food I have ever eaten. Wow. Try the salmon egg roll, honey and garlic chicken and beef with special sauce (X.O.). Very busy and loud. Filled with Chinese patrons so they must be doing something right."
"Myself and several of my Chinese colleagues stopped by for some dinner and of course to try the crab! I've travelled in Asia so I am no stranger to ""good"" and ""authentic"" Chinese food.

I have to say that I was quite disappointed in our visit. The crab was so so and the other dishes really lackluster. My Chinese colleagues has similar views so I know it was not just me.

Do yourself a favor and try another place in Chinatown."
"The food is excellent, but you certainly pay for it.  If you want an eclectic Chinese menu this is the restaurant for you.  On the fringe of Chinatown near Columbus Ave. R & G Lounge is always busy.  The service is efficient and attentive.  The food will please.  But the check may be a shock.  This is a good restaurant, but cheaper prices can be found elsewhere.  I would try other restaurants before coming back."
"Had lunch with my family on late Tuesday afternoon. The place was full and lucky we made reservation in the morning. Our table was in the basement room. We ordered our regular dishes, such as deep fried oysters for appetizer, their famous crab, pork spare ribs, mapo tofu, and beef turnip. All in all a very satisfying lunch. I believe R&G needs to upgrade their facilities to make the atmosphere even better."
"My wife and I felt a bit overwhelmed at the choices of restaurants in Chinatown.  We asked a couple of Chinese ladies at the cosmetic counter at Bloomingdales.  They both said R and G Lounge!  It reminded me of an old 007 film, especially the ""Lounge"" part.  It was great!  Thanks to the Bloomingdale ladies for the tip!  Get the house special beef (with secret house sauce)."
"My mentor recommended this place to me as the place to go for good Chinese.  I haven't found a better Chinese place in town although I have to confess I don't eat much Chinese so I'm not the best judge of that.

I've been a number of times, with my wife and with other friends.  The trend I've noticed is that vegetarians and pescetarians do pretty well here, the veggie and fish options are tasty.  I typically get the eggplant.  I did go with a friend who ordered the chicken and wound up disappointed by the sheer quantity of bones attached to the somewhat mysterious chunks of meat.  It tasted fine, the way chicken is supposed to taste, but the typical Chinese restaurant approach of chopping it up didn't sit well with him.

I can't fault the quality of the food personally, I like this place and it's my go to venue when I get the occasional craving for Chinese."
"It was recommended to us by our front desk clerk and we loved everything we tried.  One thing she did not mentioned was that it's a bit pricy. We had roasted duck, ling cod, and scallops in xo sauce. All items were good. My husband said the food was as good as what he grew up with back in New York. Service was prompt as well. If you don't mind paying a little more then I recommend this place to you."

Authentic Asian food. Loved the sweet corn and chicken soup. Vegetables were done just right. Would eat here again
"We ate lunch here and were very impressed at how nice the restaurant was, the food quality, and the prices.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking to eat in Chinatown!"
"This restaurant serves the best deep fried crabs so go and order their crabs!  If you love crabs you won't regret it and for first timer's like my daughter, it will make you crave for it.  You would hardly expect it to be as good as they picture it or seeing how old and humble looking their place is but those crabs are to die for and it would definitely remind you of San Francisco!"
"I think out opinion may be colored by our server.  First, we waited forever for him to pay any attention to us.  We were seated in a side room and to be fair, he was running all over the place. My husband ordered cashew chicken.  The server said, ""You want hot?""  Joe said yes and when his dinner came it was a completely different dish.  Though it tasted fine it was the server's assumption that he would prefer something totally different that was the problem.  Add to that, my husband ordered what he thought was an appetizer of oysters. When it came it was a HUGE plate of them that could very well have been a meal. Again, a little bit of communication could have gone a long way.  After we were done eating, we sat and sat and sat until a different server noticed that we had been there a long time.  When he came over I mentioned the discrepancies with what we had ordered and what appeared.  He was apologetic at which point our original server came over and dismissed the concerned one, then proceeded to blame the ""problem"" on the guy he had sent away.  It was bizarre.  Anyway, the food was fine, but given how highly the restaurant was recommended by the bus tour people and the hotel people we were disappointed.  It wasn't that good.  It certainly wasn't good enough to make up for the poor service we received."
"This restaurant is very popular with locals, and has been in the same location for over 30 years. As many reviewers have noted, the restaurant is charmless with rudimentary tables and chairs, set close together, and the service is perfunctory while efficient.  The food is consistently good, but dining for travelers, whether business or leisure, should be about more than good food; ambience and a pleasant setting and wait staff are important components of the dining experience.

Having said that, I note that many TripAdvisor reviewers like this restaurant, so I am in the minority in my mixed reactions to this place.  I think you can do better, in terms of the food and the dining experience.

Now for the details.

Three of us had lunch here on June 11th, and two of us arrived first and were directed to the basement level of this restaurant. When the third person arrived, she was told we were in the basement section, but had to find us on her own.    One person in our party has worked in this area for three decades, and has often had lunch here during that time, and the occasional dinner. 

Tea is served immediately upon sitting down, and without request. We had to ask for water (pretty standard now, in drought areas). We had the fried garlic crab ($48) - they serve crab at least 8 different ways, the ""special beef"",  & the Chinese chicken salad.  All were good. As we shared each order, the waiter offered fresh plates towards the end of the meal, a nice touch often overlooked by many restaurants. The total cost for three, including one beer, was $100 (so the crab obviously ran the cost up).

It was disappointing to learn that a recent reviewer had to seek urgent medical care because the wait staff failed to advise her properly of the ingredients in a dish.  Unfortunately in a large restaurant with wait staff whose English is imperfect at best (and who may not themselves know the ingredients in a dish, or understand the dire consequences of food allergies), this kind of mistake can happen, so it's best to avoid this restaurant (and similar) if you could have severe reactions to certain ingredients.

Overall, you can eat well here, but there are a lot of better choices for travelers."
"I ordered dinner from this place and specifically said I was allergic to pork and asked for the food not to be prepared with any pork or pork tainted surfaces. I get their extremely bland and tasteless food and half way into eating, I realize there is some other meat in the chicken dish. Their special sauce that they poured on the chicken was made with pork sausage! I had to call to find this out because they don't list it on the menu and the woman kept putting me on hold over and over again even though I explained I needed to know because it was a health emergency! She then told me it was just a little ""sausage"" like it was no big deal. These people have a lack of respect for their customer's health! I am still in shock of how apathetic they were to the fact that they put my life in danger and had to seek urgent care."
"it was one of the best chinese meals I have ever eaten & the deep fried crab is to die for . We were recommended it by the receptionist at our hotel & went back every night we could ,obviously you book a time if possible as it it a very popular restaurant, every meal we tried was exceptional and the staff were very friendly and welcoming no matter how busy they were. If I am ever in san fransisco again I will certainly be eating there again. 
  Mrs B. Holmes & friends"
"One of my SF favorites for their Dungeness Crab when in season. Our party of 10 shared 3 along with the Black Mushrooms with Mustard Greens, Special Beef, and Peking Duck. All is outstanding. Service was great. Reservations highly recommended."
"So let's get it out there - this place is amazing. The food was shipped down directly from heaven - it is the freshest cleanest most delicate Chinese good I've ever eaten 
To keep this balanced: the ambience is beautifully tacky... And the staff are aloof and kinda unapproachable. But you know, none of that matters when the food arrives. 
How long before this place gets it's 1st Michelin star??"
"When we go to San Francisco, we focus on restaurants that have Dungeness crab and Asian  food since these are hard to find in the desert.  This place combines both.  It is always crowded so make reservations.  Their food is great, and make sure you have the crab. Don't let the drab outside scare you."
"We were recommended by a cousin who said this was the best in Chinatown and he was right. I would say the food is as good as anything I eat in Chinatown London (maybe better) and as good as anything I get in Hong Kong. The signature dishes are a must particularly the Salt and Pepper Crab, the roasted Squab (pigeon). There are two floors and the ground floor is less frilly and is walk in , but expect up to an hour wait if they can fit you in. I suggest book ahead and that's upstairs but has table cloths etc. still expect a wait but persevere its worth it."
"Really Good! We really wanted to have a good Chinatown meal after a long flight to SF, but didn't reaaly feel like sitting down for a meal. R&G got such rave reviews, but almost every review says how busy they are. So, we took a chance to see if the had a take out menu, and they did! Everything was ready and packed nice 15 minutes after the call. They even provided plasticware and plates. Great meal in the comfort of our hotel room!"
"This place had excellent Food, we had to wait, but no too long!!  Super busy, probably because it is so good.  The flavors were exceptional.  So nice to have good Chinese, since you can't find any where I live on Maui :)"
"Went with several friends, had a private room and a multi course feast!  An absolute gastronomic delight!!"
Had dinner with the bf on May 28. We shared a couple of dishes. The vegetable spring rolls were very tasty and the beef chow mein with pan fried noodles delicious. The chicken with broccoli was just ok. The service was slow and not very friendly. And the ladies bathroom on the top floor looked like someone had an accident of some kind.
"We only happened upon this restaurant because of the suggestion of a rogue tour guide in our hotel.  This was great advice as we would never have chosen a restaurant in China town with this name. 

We arrived just as they opened their doors for lunch.  The restaurant quickly filled to capacity, a good sign.  The food was excellent - service a little slow but still a great meal and lots of fun."
...in San Francisco are galore. But This restaurant is rated as one of the better ones one my list. We alwAys dine here on our visits.  We have the  1). Garlic Deep Fried Crab. But Steamed and/or With Black Bean Sauce is just as good. 2). Braised Abalone. 3). Salted Fish with Chicken Fried Rice is excellent. Everything is well prepared. You couldn't go wrong if you threw a dart
"Have been to R&G many times and love the food and drinks!  The special R&G beef, the crab, the Peking duck, the XO chicken and many other dishes are awesome.  Extra fun to have a big group of people and share these dishes!  Hit up R&G if you want an authentic Chinese meal with good quality!"
"This place is hurried and definitely dated.  Ordered the fried chicken with lemon sauce and the special beef. The chicken was so lemony it tasted like lemonade and the beef was black and overcooked.  Oh, don't use the bathroom downstairs-trust me, just don't."
"i have been there for a business dinner and after a trip in the nearby Chinatown we have gone into this restaurant. We booked in advance (4 seats) but this didn't help as we had to wait 15-20 minutes as well. The restaurant was very crowded. When seated we chose several disches: very good the fried crab but the pechinese duck was what I loved the most. We had some spicy beef with veggies and kind of tortillas with chicken and cabbage very tasteful, some very good mushrooms stuffed and grilled shrimps with what tasted like milk sauce (but i can be wrong, I didn't order directly and I don't remeber the name). At the end everything was great. my only regret is that the only dessert was ice-cream. Service is very good. The restaurant was crowded (thursday evening) and the interiaor is somehow what you may expect from a chinese restaurant. We spent 195$+gratuity and everybody was more than satisfied (after all we spent little more at Outback outside SF....but here completely different). A place to come back again. I suggest"
We had reservations and the place was packed. We got there 10 mins. before and we were told we would be seated at 8 the time of our reservation. We were! Our waiter was great! We had the corn and chicken soup ( not much chicken but had a nice taste to it!) it was okay. All our other dishes were very good. The duck was delicious but a lot of little bones. The chicken dish  did not have much flavor but the steamed broccoli was good! The boneless ribs were tasty and the fried rice was great! A lot of people got the crab dish so it must be good. We were too full to try it! All in all it was worth going to!
"We visited this restaurant last evening. We chose R&G because it is highly recommended on Trip Advisor and the location was close to our hotel. It was very crowded and we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated as the hostess stated upon our arrival. The lobby is very small but there is seating upstairs as well as down. You may be asked to share a table especially if you are a party of two. Most guests didn't mind this. 
The restaurant is dated. Seating is very close together and the tables are small.  Service is very fast and friendly. We had Kung Pao Chicken and fried Chicken with Lemon Sauce. Both was very good but we have to admit nothing exceptional."
"Good friends kindly offered to treat us to a Chinatown dinner at R&G, one of their favorite places, and what a meal it was!  Salted crab, shrimp with walnuts, citrus beef, pork ribs, we feasted on so many amazing dishes.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night, reservations are obviously a must.  This is a don't miss restaurant!"
I had my dinner in R&G yesterday & the food is really awesome!! We ordered their one signature salt & pepper crab. The crab is good & big where is enough for 2 of us. We ordered their shrimp fried noodles where come with big portion. The bill come around $62 which is reasonable
"My mom treated some friends to this restaurant for lunch when our family went to visit my uncle in the USA around mid May of last year (2013). 

Food in this restaurant was superb. For environmental reasons, the shark's fin was changed to bird's nest. 

The seafood served in this restaurant was tender, nice, and fresh too. 

The fried rice was also well cooked. 

All of the food served here was equal or similar to one of the top restaurants in Hong Kong. 

We were given a private room, so the gathering was quiet, enjoyable and comfortable. 

The only shortcoming is that though we had the set menu, dessert was not included, and the only dessert they had for lunch was ice cream, and this did not serve my uncle and my mom, as they are diabetic."
"Recommended by a few people, so 6 of us here on holiday thought we would try it. We were ushered into a private room and then left there. Had to wave frantically through the doorway to get any service. 
Had heard about the crab. But of course anything salt and peppered has heaps of MSG. Unfortunately this seemed to be the way with almost all the dishes. Wine list was ordinary as well. Tried the crab, San Choi Bao, Peking Duck, beef and special fried rice. Were warned the rice was spicy - also full of MSG. Peking duck was a little odd - it seemed like it had been deep fried? All the food came out at once even tho' we asked for it not to. We had also asked for plain steamed rice - this didn't come and when we enquired it still didn't arrive. Chef must've cleaned the rice cooker! When we asked if we could order other items we were told the kitchen was closing - at 9.15 pm! Ha ha! 
Overall - a very disappointing experience - such a let down when you are in a great city on holidays..."
"We ordered the Special Crab plate, which was delicious! The crab was seasoned just right and delicately fried. We also also ordered the Peking Duck and Seafood Fried Rice; they were both wonderful. I'm glad I cancelled the vegetables, because this was was too much food for 2. 

We were lucky we arrived before the rush, because there were about 20 people waiting as we left.

A must if you want Chinese food."
"Read about this place in a guide book.

Was a little trek from our Fisherman's Wharf hotel, but it was certainly worth it. Got there a bit late so didn't get a great table (in a corridor behind the bar!)

The food was FANTASTIC"
"There are literally hundreds of Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, so finding one can be difficult if you are not from the area.   This restaurant was recommended by our hotel concierge and it delivered on all marks.   Clean, great, fresh food, excellent service.   Many of the seafood options (lobster, shrimp) are alive and prepared as needed.   A view into the kitchen revealed a very clean facility.  Wait staff were attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.

The menu has all of the old standbys, but also many delicacies not found in most Chinese restaurants around the country.   Top quality, great flavor, and the prices, although a bit high, were definitely commensurate with the quality of the product and the level of service."
"My sister and I ate dinner here on a Thursday early evening.  We were seated right away and the service was very good.  I had Kung Pao Chicken, I think the best I've ever had!  My sister had a shrimp dish with walnuts - also excellent.  We practically had to beg for our check, so we weren't rushed at all. The staff was not overly friendly but they were efficient.  If/when I go back to San Francisco, I would make it a point to eat here again."
Do you want to know how great the Salt & Pepper Crab is at R&G Lounge?  We brought Mom to San Francisco for Mother's Day and brought her here for the first time.  Before the weekend was over she wanted to come back again!  The Salt & Pepper Crab is so amazingly delicious!!  Any other dishes we've ordered to go along with it have all been great too but a trip to San Francisco wouldn't be complete without having crab because it's our ultimate favorite.
"Was recommended to this place by a friend. We arrived at off peak hours, so had good service and brilliant recommendations by the waiter. We had the lobster noodles and a stir fried vege. Fantastic! Very authentic southern chinese style food. One of our best meals at San Francisco."
"We went to the basement restaurant to have lunch on a Sunday, at 1 pm. The place was just beginning to empty out the lunch crowd. Noise level was very acceptable even though the ceiling was low, but the two waiters did not have a friendly attitude, as if we were a bother rather than customers. There was no language barrier as we spoke their dialect. In the end, I gave the food and dining environment  4 , but the service a 2, hence my overall rating was just above a 3."
"The bus tour guide recommended this Chinese restaurant, we were slightly skeptical, however as there are so many to choose from in Chinatown we decided to try R & G.  The guide was right, great food, large portions & good value for money. Its a very busy place, but  lunch service was fast & the waiter explained the dishes for us that the next table had ordered as we liked the look of them. Definitely one to try in San Fran."
"Recommended by a guy at the bar down the street.  The dining room is in the cellar.  This is a very busy, noisy restaurant with a high percentage of Asian customers.  The service is almost rushed.  We were served about three minutes after we ordered. The check appeared before I finished my meal.  (VERY reasonably priced, especially for SF.)  The food is outstanding!  Three in our party of five had the roast duck.  The others had seafood and beef.  Could not ask for better.  Will highly recommend the place for the food.  If you are looking for a quiet, romantic, leisurely meal this may not be for you."
Had to queue for 40 minutes which was fine. Service as expected was very poor. So many people waiting they clearly don't rely on customers returning for a smile. Birth had starters which went well. Mains came and frankly my Duck was one of the greasiest I've ever had and full of bone. Mrs RT had a dish that was far too sweet. Both left disappointed. Certainly not worth the hype.
"We were surprised when we walked in at the number of multi-generational Chinese families having dinner.Our hotel recommended this place and we had expected it to be more touristy but were pleasantly surprised at its authenticity. The food was delicious. Be warned, there is no atmosphere, it is more like a Chinese diner where most of the clientele are Chinese."
"The signature dish for the restaurant is Salt & Pepper Whole Crab, and we were not disappointed.  For people looking for very authentic Chinese food, this is definitely the place to go.  We were a party of 6 and had a reservation.  

The crab was delicious with a very sweet flavor.  I lost track of the dishes ordered, but everything tasted exceptional.  Also the service is very fast, considering the number of tables through the 2 levels."
"Apparently, Anthony Bourdain put this place on the map by highlighting their signature dish, ""Salt and Pepper Dungeness Crab"", which looks great, but is really difficult to eat, so recommend reviewing the menu, as we did and trying something else as well.  We were pleased with our overall food experience, and the restaurant ambiance is nothing special, just really casual and in the heart of Chinatown.  The restaurant was recommended by our concierge and was walking distance from our hotel, which was convenient.  The restaurant is nothing special, but the food was very good.  Good news is that it felt like there were a lot of locals there so keep that in mind, try a variety, and don't expect too much ambience or top notch service and you will be fine."
"The food here is delicious. We ordered plenty of food and was not let down. Many people had ordered the crab which looked amazing, but I'm never sure of how to eat it! Service was good and overall a good price."
We had a family style dinner with about 10 courses.  Best Chinese food I have ever eaten.  The salt and pepper crab is what they are known for.  Food is very fresh and definitely authentic.  Try the lychee martini and the watermelon martini.  You will thank me.
"A couple of people had recommended this place so thought we were in for a treat. Service was weird, but I think that's standard for Chinatown restaurants - we had a booking but were seated after 3 couples who arrived and had no booking - which was strange. Anyway, the waiter was good and gave us some menu advice. Peking Duck was odd - really hard to get off the bone to stuff into the buns, I ended up having to tear it off with my hands. Satay was drowned in a bland tasting sauce. Special beef was a  dry dish (no sauce) which was ok but a very one-note affair (sweet almost cured) Pak choi with garlic had cloves of roasted garlic on top but no discernable flavour.  I'm from London and maybe this is just a difference in local palate but I found this a very mediocre bland affair with nothing to recommend it, other than we didn't get sick.. A shame as I was looking forward to some great Chinese food in SF but this just disappointed"
"Although the staff here all are Chinese and spoke the language, the food was very interesting (in a bad way).  There were some classic, familiar dishes in the Chinese culture that were served to us in a never before seen type experience.  Comments at our table, ""This is not such and such"" and ""How can they call this green onion chicken with gravy on top?  What Chinese dish is this?""  ""Gravy?!"".  The portions were very small and the prices were obscenely high...opposite of what an authentic Chinese dining experience should be.  We were out of towners visiting nearby Chinatown and some friends (not Chinese obviously) referred this to us.  Sorry, wish it could have been better."
This very authentic restaurant is quite large with both upstairs and downstairs dining.  The wait staff is attentive even though not all of them speak English.  There are a lot of locals so you  know the food is good.
"This restaurant has been heavily reviewed by a lot of people. The no. 1 most popular dish is undoubtedly the salt and pepper crab. Instead, we ordered squab. Honestly, we did not put a lot of expectation. Surprisingly, it was exceptional good. The meat was tasty and remained juicy. The best of it was the bones which always distinguish good and great. You can chewed on the bones! If you haven't tried squab before. I highly recommend this dish from this restaurant. There are not that many restaurants serve this authentic Cantonese dish and make this good.

The restaurant validates nearby parking garage for 2 hours parking if the total purchase is over $50. Keep in mind, the restaurant waiting line is usually at least 30 mins and sometimes more than an hour on weekend nights."
"Tell any local that you have plans to go eat at R & G Lounge or that you did eat there and they just light up and excitedly share what their favourite dishes are! 

Having read the reviews both on Tripadvisor and Yelp, our expectations were reasonable when it came to the food, service and the waiting period for a table. We were open to sharing a table which decreased our wait time to about 20 minutes (Thursday around 8pm) and lucked out with being seated downstairs with some friendly foodies from New York (Brooklyn), Italy and France. 

The woman at the host stand was welcoming and friendly. The atmosphere is definitely a bit chaotic at the door/waiting area but we didn't mind. It was a good sign that there were many Chinese families eating here along with a diverse group of patrons. 

We had the signature dishes of the Salt and Pepper Dungeness Crab and the Peking Duck. Both were tasty, but definitely greasier than other versions we've enjoyed elsewhere. Our table mates enjoyed their sautéed scallops (can't remember the sauce), Salt and Pepper Prawns and also the Dungeness Crab. We also had a simple sautéed vegetable dish which was tasty.

Service was efficient as typical of any busy Chinese Restaurant. Our server was an older gentleman who seemed pleased that we made our choices so quickly. He was professional and on the ball with bringing us tea, replenishing our water, changing our side plates, etc. 

Tips - Be prepared to wait so don't go if you're already hungry. If you're a group of 5 or more, you should definitely attempt to make a reservation. Our table mates really made our experience so positive as they were engaging and funny as well as open to embracing an authentic local dining experience like we were. Don't go with expectations of a mind-blowing gastronomical experience. This is a genuine, Chinese restaurant experience!"
"If you like authentic Chinese food this is a good place.  It has NO ambiance though and NOT good for a business meeting especially where we sat.  It was very loud and the tables were on top of each other.

Even though my husband got ill in the night from eating the rich greasy food I had no problems with it and did enjoy it.  We shared several dishes a signature dish called ""Live Crab with Salt and Pepper"".  This whole crab is deep fried with a very light batter and is pretty messy to eat because it comes out with shells and all so you have to dig out the meat yourself.  So if you don't care about being messy in front of your friends go for it.  The other dishes we shared was the whole duck, an eggplant dish and baby bokchoy. 

I know this has been recommend by Zagats and Michelin Guide but it can't be for the ambiance but only for the food.  I haven't read their reviews but should.  

If you plan to go make a reservation as when we got there, there were many people waiting without reservations.

You go and experience it for yourself. That's all I can say."
"Ate here on the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel and were not disappointed. Very busy but waited about 20 minutes for a table at about 7.00pm - thankfully an efficient queuing system.
Head waiter was very helpful in recommending dishes resulting in one of the best Chinese meals we have eaten. A lot of locals eating there as well as visitors."
"The services was good.  The food, not really.  I ordered rthe fried crab and honet baby ribs.  The crab was oily and not tasty.  The ribs were OK.  I had crab before in Chinese restaurant, and it was amazing, not this one.  I had one piece of the crab, but no one asked me why I didn't eat my food and charged me $65.00.  I wouldn't go back, food not good and way to expensive"
"I have been going to R&G lounge for 25 years and I am never disapointed. I had the vegetables chow mein (Hong Kong Style) and they were as always very good. Big portions and very local, I highly recommend it."
"The food is certainly delicious and it's located in Chinatown which is always neat but it's very crowded and the staff isn't overly friendly. The restaurant is a revolving door. They herd you in, shove you toward a table and ask to take your order before your rear end has even touched the seat. Go before 7 pm and you won't have to wait long at all. The crispy chicken, spring rolls and calamari are yummy...although they are heavy handed with the salt."
"Restaurant name is unique however the food is delicious.  A chinese restaurant that must be visited.  Food is delicious in a casual atmosphere, The chicken soup hit the spot when out in the cool air of San Francisco.  The spare ribs was made perfectly."
"The food is certainly good.  We enjoyed the chow mein with chicken and the kung pao chicken, along with hot and sour soup and vegetable egg rolls.  The soup was the only disappointment, the rest was very good.  But the place just screams classic Chinatown experience.  It is high energy dining, with a dizzying array of waiters clad in formal uniforms moving quickly from table to table, and lots of families speaking Chinese and sharing meals with plates everywhere.  The service is as bad as you'd expect from a true Chinatown place - they work hard, but they don't smile or offer you any sense they're working for a tip.  The guy told us at one point we could not have rice with our kung pao because we already had a noodle dish and that ""woudl be too much rice"" - needless to say we explained why this was crap and he reluctantly provided us with a small dish of rice.  Overall, this place is well worth a visit in the heart of Chinatown because it checks every box - good food, almost comically bad service, and nice dining room buzz and energy."
"As a rule, I avoid Chinese restaurants for various reasons. I went to the R&G Lounge with colleagues however, as it was a majority decision.

The R&G Lounge showed me what ""real"" Chinese food can be like.

Lots of fantastic fresh seafood dishes: Cod, Lobster, Scallops - all delicious. A real break from the rubbery chicken, frozen spring rolls, sugar and msg that I'm used to in the UK.

The restaurant has no pretense and even seems a little basic and dated internally, but the food more than makes up for all that. I think we spent a bout $60 a head, which given the amount of good food we were served, was good value.

Will definitely return next time I'm in SF."
"R&G offers some of the most amazing authentic Southern Chinese Seafood dishes. Don't trust me, trust the crowd and the waiting line of this place. Please try not to order fried rice when you dine here, or any other true chinese cuisine restaurants. It would be like ordering cheeseburger at a top-tier steakhouse. Here, the salt&pepper scallop and crab are to die for."
"I keep reading about how amazing R & G Lounge is ~ all three of the guidebooks we had mentioned it. Tripadvisor reviewers seem to like it. I remain unimpressed ~ I must have missed something.

We were seated downstairs. I would have preferred upstairs, but we weren't given a choice. The basement decor is abysmal, linoleum floors, fake wood panel walls and fish tanks. Not pretty tropical fish in sparkling tanks, dingy tanks from which they presumably get your fresh seafood. We sat right next to the carp & lobster. One of the carp was sickly & another was belly up, gasping for air. We didn't order any carp.

One reviewer mentioned the Lychee Martini. I'd have loved to try that! We never saw a drink menu. We were offered tea. Not a choice of drinks, tea or nothing. At that point I really could have used alcohol, especially staring at a dying carp, but we had no idea they served liquor.

The salt & pepper crab was more than we wanted to spend, so we had the salt & pepper scallops instead, very tasty but kind of greasy. The beef & chicken satay was very good. The eggrolls were delicious and the accompanying sweet & sour sauce packed a pleasantly surprising kick.

All in all, good (not amazing) food, brusque service and horrid ambience."
"I have worked in San Francisco for over six years and I have had no issues with other similar restaurants located there or Oakland.  When I first went there years ago with a group, the food was good and the service was acceptable. Other times it took a while for me eating solo to receive service and I felt rushed.  On my recent trip a friend who had gone there with me in the afore mentioned group wanted to return, based on their prior experience.  So we ordered the  walnut fried shrimp and chicken fried rice, when our shrimp arrived my friend stated that the shrimp tasted spoiled and after tasting it I agreed so we sent it back.  When the fried rice arrived I asked didn't you order it with chicken? They said yes however we both did not see any chicken, when I brought it to the attention of the waitress she attempted to insult our intelligence by saying "" the chicken was cut up into small pieces"". With both of us having been there before we left, vowing ""never again"".  My dining partner are both in our fifties and have traveled the world including Hong Kong and mainland China and had better service in both places."
"We came across the R&G by accident during a random walk around San Francisco.  It was busy and clearly popular, so we decided to try it.  Expect a wait at lunch or dinner without a reservation. The food was excellent and I can recommend the egg rolls (superb!), Peking Duck, Kung Pao Chicken, barbecued ribs and seafood hot pot.  Almost every other table ordered at least one fried crab and it looked and smelled fabulous.  Although space is tight in the basement where most of the tables are located, it is a multicultural scene with people from all over the world....families on either side of us were speaking different Chinese dialects.  A very enjoyable meal and we'd happily return there on our next trip to the city."
"We went here for Chinese New Year, recommended by hotel concierge.  100 % authentic.  We were lucky to book a reservation...when we got there the lineup was out the door and a large number of people on the street.  Lots of Asians inside which is always a good sign!  It was packed for a Saturday night.  Their signature dish, Fried Crab, was amazing...salt and pepper crab deep fried...so fresh and tasty...I think we could have ordered this as the only dish for supper and still be happy.  This is their most expensive dish ($43 seasonal rate), but well worth it.  Their Treasures dish (fried eggplant, tofu, sea cucumber with black bean sauce) was exceptional.  The sea cucumber was filled with diced shrimp and when you took a bite, you realized the subtle flavours of dried chillies underneath the shrimp...never had a dish where one item was so distinct.  The seafood hotpot was fantastic with heapings of seafood.  And of course the hot and sour soup was just right.  All of the dishes came out within 5 mins of each other and we were done in 1 hour...could not believe how fast the meal went.  And pretty decent value, not crazy expensive.   What a great meal...would go back here in a heartbeat if we visit San Fran again."
"On the boarder of Chinatown this restaurant sits. It was recommended to us by one of the locals. I can see why, by the time noon arrived the place was busy and I would say the locals out paced the tourists. 

The egg rolls were the best I have tasted in a long time. They right amount of crispiness and the duck sauce just added to the the flavor. I strayed from my usual chicken and cashshew nuts to vegetable chow mien. The noodles and vegetables were savory and I enjoyed the dish. 
The service was fine. 

The only disappointment was no fortune cookie.  We had to go the fortune cookie factory about 5 minutes away. This is worth the trip as you can see how they are made and eat one right out of the oven."

We have been here a few times. The fried crab is delicious as is the Special Beef. The snow peas are crisp and delicious. Be careful the first time you visit- you will need about half of the food than you will order. And don't forget the Leechee martini!  We were first directed to the restaurant by Anthony Bourdain in No Reservations. It is a busy place- make reservations!!
The bellman at the Omni where we are staying recommended R & G Lounge so we went over there today for lunch.  This restaurant is very busy and really no atmosphere to speak of but their food was fantastic.  Lunch specials are $8.00 - $8.50 and you get so much food.  I ordered the Garlic Honey Chicken with Broccoli - yummy.  My husband had duck and noodle soup and said both were fantastic and the service was great.  This is one of the hidden gems of this city.
"ordered several dishes:  oxtail, chicken & veges.  The food was medicare.  The oxtail was a little tough; the chicken and veges were ok.

The restaurant is a little dingy.  You go down some steps to the basement.  A little dark.  Service was average."
"I ate here last night for dinner and just looking at pictures again makes me want to come here again. I had just a great experience as the service was fast and friendly, and the food was excellent. Tons of great food without breaking the bank. Had a great time and look forward to coming back!"
"We were recommended to this place by a local who works at the jewelry mart, and since he is of Chinese descent, we figured we should take his word for it, and we were glad we did.
First of all the parking, always an issue in SF. What you do is drive past the R&G Lounge, and stay in the far left lane (its on a one way street). Take your parking ticket with you as they validate for the garage at the R&G. 
Second, the food... wow, so amazing, fresh and very unique. We had the Salted Crab (a house specialty), the Vanilla Prawns, the Three Treasures, and was it amazing. This is Chinese food like you have never had, and I will never forget.
Make sure you wash it down with a Tsing Tao beer too, its the perfect accompaniment.
Cheers!!"
"We were at R & G lounge in time for lunch. We got a table promptly, service was quick, food was good. Their Peking duck was good (though I prefer the one served at Peking Garden, Manila) but they could serve more buns with it. Their crab was a delight for the eyes. I especially enjoyed their calamari, the chow mein wasn't bad, but not spectacular either. They served beef strips but I didn't fancy it because it was rather too sweet for my taste buds. I don't mind going back to R & G."
"We were lead to this hotel by the concierge from the Westin St Francis and it was a delicious meal.  Normally chinese food is salty and over seasoned but R&G is not like any other.  The food tasted fresh and the service was very attentive.  

We got the special Leechies martini, not a fan of leechies but other than that tasted fine.  We DID NOT order the crab appetizer but everyone around us did, we just did not think we could finish it.

We ordered the salmon avocado spring rolls and they look nothing like the picture, the picture shows them being plump and they are not, However they were very tasty.

A definite return visit is in order."
Fabulous restaurant! Their house special prawns were simply amazing! No reservations but we got there early and were seated immediately. Within easy walking distance of the Orchard Hotel.
"The tour guide on the Hop-On, Hop-Off bus suggested this restaurant, so we decided to go. It was really busy since we were there at lunch time, but the food took surprisingly not too much time to reach our table after we ordered. The waiters were nice and the food was pretty good. Decent prices considering it is San Francisco and it's a real Chinese restaurant in Chinatown."
We sat next to the fish tank that was duct taped and sweating with condensation. Shredded chicken salad and chicken fried rice had chicken so finely minced it was hard to find. Dressing on salad was loaded with salt. Egg rolls were dripping in grease and the salmon rolls were not good. Bbq pork appetizer had nickel sized slices of pork surrounded by fat.  Service was brusque and impersonal. We ordered plain rice and chicken fried rice to go (at the beginning of the meal) and we received two fried rice orders with no chicken. Why we did not cancel this order is beyond me. This was one of the worst meals i have had and we were very sorry we ate the food.
"When asked what was the best Chinese restaurant in San Francisco several tour guides said the same thing: R & G. The restaurant has a simple décor and a line of people waiting to go downstairs to eat. Most of the people waiting on line were Asian, so we knew the food was going to be good. The service was good and the food was  excellent. We ordered clams in bean sauce, baked pork with baked beans, shrimp fried rice with pineapple and a vegetable dish.
R & G is a great place to experience authentic, reasonably priced, good Cantonese food."
"We just ate at R&G Lounge for the second time. We love the authentic, succulent Cantonese dishes. Portions are generous with reasonable prices for the City. Our server suggested we were ordering too much food until we told him we wanted leftovers to take home where we have no good Chinese restaurants. The downstairs seating area lacks ambience, but is more than adequate to accommodate diners. The restaurant is frequented by Chinatown locals and business people from the financial district.  Reservations are recommended if you want to avoid a wait."
"Most of you non-Asian people don't even now what REAL Chinese food is!  This place has great Southern Chinese food, fresh and tasty, not covered up by lots of sauce to hide the taste of freshness.  If you want spicy, go for Northern Chinese food, or other Southeastern Asian cuisine, Cantonese food is not known for being spicy, it is known for freshness.  The best items are the freshly prepared seafood, made in many different ways, and alive until they get them out of the tank.  The only disappointment is the rudeness of the tall skinny hostile hostess, but you only deal with her when you go downstairs."
"We were looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant in downtown San Francisco and decided on R&G. We were seated right at the top of the stairs. I don't even know why they would put a table there. 

The restaurant is reasonably classy --  real cloth tablecloth and napkins, and staff dressed nicely -- but I wouldn't call it fine dining. 

The food was pretty bland. I had Kung Pau Chicken, which was supposedly ""spicy,"" but I have had spicier soy sauce. My wife had a seafood and noodle dish, and it was also disappointing. The whole menu was really nothing special in our opinion."
There is a reason a crowd always swirls around its entrance waiting to get in.  The R&G is terrific.  My Chinese date took me there.  Manage to sit upstairs where it's less frantic and a more refined dining setting.
"We all had mixed feelings about our meal here...first impressions count and although we had booked we still had to wait for over 20 mins for our table (and with everyone else waiting, it's not a comfortable wait....). We were then led to our table downstairs-try not to be seated here as we all felt extremely cramped and claustrophobic - this area is underground with no windows. The service was as expected, and our food was a bit mixed - we did have some good dishes but nothing that was outstanding (most we thought were pretty average, but maybe that's just because we have such great Chinese food back home...)"
The reviews seem good. We tried to make a reservation but were told to just show up at 11:30am as they have reached a reservation quota. We were assured that getting a table at that timing is not a problem. We were a party of 4 adults and a toddler so waiting for 45 minutes was no fun at all despite being early for lunch. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari and crab. They were way too salty-we could not taste the sweetness of the crab even if it was fresh. The cod fish was so heavily marinated robbing the delicate fish of all other flavor. The honeyed ribs were okay and the tofu dish too starchy. Guess the plain snow pea vegetable dish was the best. The fried rice with egg white was fairly acceptable. I would give this place a miss. The wonton noodle stall across the road named Hong Kei was a gem! Cheap and very tasty food. There is also a queue at peak hours too.
"Nice room upstairs, small portions, pricey ($15) for modest size dish of beef chowmein. Tasty food. Slow service, forgot one of our dishes. We spilled a cup of tea and no one offered fresh napkins. Overall, okay."
Friendly staff but the food was nothing spectacular. Some local sites claim this to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in  the area - I think they might just not know what good Chinese food really tastes like - and prices are quite high for some of the dishes alsi. You better pick a restaurant spontaneously walking around China town.
"The Chinese food served here especially the Dungeness Crab was amazing. So much so that it was able to satisfy my craving for some Chinese cuisine after being away from home for a week. The service here was friendly enough but the downside was that the queue was long despite arriving at 5pm. Hence, I suggest that you make a reservation beforehand."
"If you're used to americanized Chinese restaurants, expect to have a different experience. The restaurant is on a corner, located a block away from a Hilton hotel :) and public indoor parking. Get your parking ticket validated with your meal. I've been told that it's easier to get in for lunch than for dinner due to its popularity. I got there at 11:30 a.m. which was perfect as the place was standing room only by 12:15.

The food presentation is professional and appealing. I went with a group and there were several dishes that I would go back to try. The menu selection gives you the option to order your own dish or get several options to share. The seafood looked fresh, the vegetables were vibrant, and the other protein options were delicious. Check out the place for an experience. Plan on being there for at least an hour or longer as the food is not brought out quickly. Enjoy!"
"Excellent food - especially the seafood. The service was a little slow and less than attentive, but the food makes up for it. Arrive early because this place is extremely busy."
"I was in San Fran for 3 days and I dined there twice. Believe me, I'd dine there every meal if I could, despite a good 20-min walk up and down the hills from my hotel to the place.
It is the only place where I found DECENT and AUTHENTIC Cantonese dishes that actually match those offered in quality restaurants in Guangzhou (Canton) or Hong Kong. The great thing is, not only the Chinese find it authentic, my American friends, 9 of them, all loved the dishes. 
Not to brag too much about it, but that is the charm of authentic Cantonese--fresh yet flavorful, healthy yet tasty, exquisite yet inexpensive. (And, yes, I am Cantonese.) And these are exactly what I found about the food in R&G Lounge.
p.s. It does not affect me in any way as long as the food is that good, but I think they have a Michelin 3- or 4-star rating too."
"We discovered R&G Lounge several years ago and make it a point to eat here when we visit SF. If you have a big party, call ahead for reservations, however, they do take walk-ins. Ate here after a fun day of Christmas shopping (there were two of us); our wait was less than 20 minutes. The only bad thing about going with only 2 people is that you can't order everything on their menu! I love their R&G Special House Beef, Honey Spareribs, and the Salt & Pepper crab is great. Thanks R&G!"
"Awful service. Avoid the chicken sate, broccoli chicken and expect to feel sick from eating so much fat if you order the crab.  They messed up several dishes we ordered, were slow and rude.  Must be the holiday rush, but as a local with friends from out of town, I know there are much better places to eat in China town."
"(11 Dec 13 at 8pm-10pm) I just posted after had dinner there just now and so so dissapointed the services... we called many times to asked our order since next table already got their order even though we order first and waiting for half an hour, when we called the Waiter 'Kevin' to check the order and he apologized and said ""sorry as the delivered your order to wrong table.. and please wait I will follow up"".. after 10 minutes the order not coming yet. we called him again and ask for Manager and no body came. after that the senior lady 'Amanda' came to our table and what make us so upset that she told us that the other table actually already reserved the food before came.. she think that she can fooled us!! the waiter Kevin told us the truth but the senior 'Amanda' lied to us... oh unbelieveable!!! after long arguing with her, finally she offered complimentary drinks and noodle foir the kids for the mistake, but we still wanted to see manager becuase she is not solved the problem. and then the more senior lady came and wanted to solve the problem but actually she doesn't know the problem at all. as we were hungry then we just continue the dinner,  and what made us surprised when we wanted to pay the bill and what the promised to us that noodles and drinks on complementary but that keep charging us. we complained again and their respond is ""we offred complimentary already but you still asked to see Manager' that's why they keep charging... oh man! can you all imagine that they already offered us complimentary but they took it back and charged to us becuase we still wanted to see manager becuase couldn't be solved!! and when we are about to leaving the place, i heard bed respond to us from the senior lady at cashier counter! WILL NOT COMING BACK AND NOT RECOMENDABLE for SURE!!!"
"While touring San Francisco, this was recommended by someone on our bus.  Glad we took his advice!  Great food, great service and left satisfied!"
"Did we hit this place on a bad day?  (Thanksgiving)  We were served plates of greasy forgettable salt & pepper shrimp and an RG ""special"" beef (somewhat tasty but ghastly to behold, nearly black strips of thin beef in a gluey sauce plunked on a white plate) with a pot of tepid tea, NO RICE, not even a parsley garnish, for about $50.  Hunger is the best sauce, so we ate it all after a long day of travel, but service was nonexistent and food a complete let-down, served in a most unappetizing way.  Thanks for nothing, R & G.  Oh, except clean bathrooms, which in Chinatown is saying something, I guess."
"The food was so so but the service was horrible. The waiters were rude. They didn't want you to stay long there after you had ordered, especially during busy hours."
"This place is always crowded though they have it down to a science.  Their salf and pepper crab is greasy but good.  The service is very rushed so don't expect to to be left alone. They will ""rush"" you out of the door."

we had the crab with the black bean sauce and duck.  Both we very good.  We also had the nest soup which was also very good.  Service was nice and competent.
"After Alcatraz and in need of Chinese food, our Chinese taxi driver took us to this small restaurant on Kearny Street. No queue he said, that's good. I have never tasted such delicious Chinese food. The sauce was so delicate in the chicken and cashew nuts and their signature beef equally as good. Crowded, yes, but mainly Chinese clientele and very quick turn over. The queue was 30 deep when we came out!"
"For a major city's Chinatown, this food is totally overrated. Good yes, but only adequate. House special beef dish tasty but not rave worthy. The spring rolls with salmon and avocado were excellent thought. Kung pao chicken bland flavor except for the hot pepper burst, which did not make it any more praiseworthy. Suspect this restaurant is EZ recommendation for concierge and hotel staff- 'safe' place to recommend- very clean and efficient but simply not a unique food experience. You could do better R&g- and your service could be much better- I know service is typically brusque in 'Chinese- style' restaurants, but if they depend on tourists, they could work on this. I wouldn't go back- will research for something more exciting in city"
The crabs are to die for at this place. Try their deep fried salt and pepper dungy crabs as this is not only their signature dish but also their best. Make sure to get 1 crab per maximum of 2 people as it will not be enough to serve more than 2. We also tried the special beef but if you like authentic chinese food stay away from this dish. It is pretty much just ginger beef at its best.
"Everytime I visit SF, I make it a point to visit R&G Lounge. The service is great for an authentic Chinese restaurant and all their dishes are solid. I'm a big seafood fan and their salt & pepper crab is amazinggggg.

I also had a wedding reception there and they do great with large parties."
"And I'm sure it is very good. Think the problem may be a result of my ordering.

For our main, I ordered dishes that were not in sauce and were quite dry with the rice. All cooked nicely but not to my taste.

I imagine I could go again and be more impressed if I happened upon a dish with more sauce that would go better with the rice. Until then, my overall impression of the meal was of disappointment."
"You walk in and are directed downstairs. It's a airless, muggy room with nice wood paneling. Service is decent. Food comes quickly but Yuck! I had Fried shrimp with honey walnuts. They smeared mayonnaise all over the shrimp and it gave it a sickening flavor that disabled me from eating much of it. I tried to scrape it off but there was too much. My husband had chicken Kung Pao. The flavoring was nice, but the chicken was chewy. Not sure if it was undercooked or overcooked or just old. Anyway, can't recommend the place"
but this isn't bad.  I like the salt and pepper crab.  this place is always busy.   we always try to eat at the bar because you may wait otherwise even with a reservation.  can be very pricey for Chinatown.
"After reviewing TripAdvisor, we decided to get takeout from here. We ordered the vegetable chow mein and the cashew chicken.

Both were very good. We didn't wait too long for our food and the service was great."
"We were told of this Chinese resturant by an american couple we meet on our trip of america, easy to find but had to wait 40 minuets for a table.  The wait was well worth it service was great and the meal fantastic, would definetly go again next time in San Francisco."
"This restaurant was recommended to me by the Ritz Carlton Hotel.  You need reservations as it is very busy.  The staff was good, service very fast, the restaurant was clean, the food good to very good and the prices reasonable. Not much atmosphere but it was a typical large Chinese dining hall/room with lots of round tables. We went with friends and would recommend the lettuce (chicken not shrimp) wraps, the Peking duck and the spare ribs. Enjoy."
"Food was very traditional Chinese food.  Flavorful and filling, it was a great meal.  The lines can be really long here, so going at an off time could be the best choice.  I had the ginger chicken, which I am more accustomed to eating cold, but doing it warm was a good experience as well."
"Pros:
The foods are really good.  
a) A lot of varieties, and good taste, strong flavor. Chinese food is famous for its strong flavor and the food at R&B lounge is. 
b) The food is served fast. 
Meet celebrities.
You can sometimes see Hong Kong celebrities. I met George Lam and also took picture with him.

Cons: 
Waiting long for seating: Every time, I go there, I have to wait and the waiting time ranging from 20-40 minutes.
Environment and services: The restaurant is small, so you don't feel comfortable sitting there and waiters are so busy with tending to new guests, you have to wait for a quite while if you ask for anything."
"We were seated in a very busy basement.  It was a huge area filled with tables, and each table was filled with waiting people.  The noise level in the place was energetic therefore, talking loud was a must.  Our menus, then food orders were promptly taken.  The food arrived and it was very good.  I had the mu shu pork and my husband had the lemon chicken.  I'd go back again!"
"The place won't hit you with its interiors or service, but instead you will be amazed with its food. Any choice would be great, but I specially recommend salt and pepper crab, R&G Special Beef"
Casual restaurant serving authentic Chinese dishes. Don't be put off by going into the basement of the lounge. The lunch menu is quite a value.  Service is prompt without being pushy. Very nice for a lunchtime bite.  Dishes are substantial and tasty.
"This was my second trip to this restaurant.  It's perfect for large groups.  The food is fantastic, and most table have a lazy-Susan so the wait staff brings entrees for the table to share.   EVERYTHING is delicious."
"Good range of dishes.  Extra star for making something off the menu- wonderful staff at this restaurant.  If in chinatown and you are looking for a chinese restaurant that is clean and isn't full of tourists, stop in here."
"ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF CHINATOWN.  There is an elegance unlike most neighborhood chinese restaurants.  Food was fresh and tasty, but the two pound lobster I ordered was no more than 1 1/4 lbs based on size of claws and tail."
"A few unrelated locals had recommended R&G and they were right. I ended up having 2 lychee cocktails and would rate these amongst the best cocktails I've experienced. We ordered the famous salt and pepper crab, R&G special beef and a chicken dish on the waiters advice. We would score them 11/10, 9/10, 5/10. It wad one of those meals where words were not spoken between my husband and I ..... The food did all the talking."
"Wandering along Kearny at 9 pm looking for something open, we saw the crowd in the basement of the R & G Lounge. Believing a crowd in a restaurant usually means good food, we headed in and got a table straight away. OK service but we had to remind them of the wine and the steamed rice. Food tasty but not as spicy as advertised. Good amount and we left well satisfied. Recommended"
"the people at the table next to me did not get an itemized bil.  They asked for one and it was wrong.  they were overcharged.  the same thing happened to me.  I got the salt and peper crab, the signature dish.  also got noodles and the black cod loin.  the black cod loin smelled like ammonia and my wife is sick today.  check my reviews, i rarely write bad reviews."
"Visited here my second time with my mother and brother over labor day weekend. I wanted to bring them to an authentic Chinese restaurant as it was their first time visiting me in San Francisco.

Like the first time, the whole crab was delicious. I've gotten both the salt and pepper and the egg yolk crabs, and both are fantastic.

But, like my first time here (last labor day weekend with friends visiting from out of town), we were again seated on the basement floor next to the bathrooms and all of the seafood tanks. The smells on the basement floor are extremely unappetizing like a mix of cleaning supplies, bathroom, and fish. The cleanliness and decor is also very lacking.

For San Francisco, there are much better authentic Chinese restaurants and the tasty crab does not make up for the lack of attention to the overall experience."
"Recommended by our driver, we had to take a look, and we were not disappointed. Opposite the Hilton in Chinatown, we were shown downstairs with no reservation to a typically Chinese restaurant. Great, friendly service, very reasonably priced food, that was fresh and tasted fantastic. We only visited on our last day before flying out, which we were disappointed with as we would have definitely visited again the food was so good."
"Been here every time we are in SFO. In fact some time we are there 2x a week while visiting.
Food is always good, Crab is excellent
Typical chinese restaurant but .... noisy and always rushing around  hahahaha  but thats the norm
Gotta love this place"
"R&G Lounge has the best REAL Chinese food in the city.  Best crab, duck, steamed egg with clams, etc.  The ONLY complaint I have is that when you order their steamed chicken dish, they are so stingy with the ginger-onion sauce.  Are they for real?  Ginger and onion doesn't cost that much and you really cannot eat the chicken without this sauce.  Many times, when I order this for takeout, I run out of sauce before my chicken is gone.  When you ask for more, they say ""NO"".  What kind of restaurant doesn't want to give you more sauce to finish eating your food???!!!"
"My first time coming here and was very enjoyable.  Awesome food, delicious.
Highly recommend reservation no matter what time and what day of the week.  We came around 9 pm for dinner and this place is still packed and still have many people waiting for their tables.
Easy parking nearby, walking distance, validated parking provided.
Must order the crab dish, would love to come back again!!"
"The Salt and Pepper Crab . . .  the best ever.  It is a whole crab, broken into piece, breaded and deep fried.  Could not be better."
I came to this restaurant with my two friends.  Most of their stuffs are overpriced.  The manager tried to sell us some herbal soup.  The customer service was mediocre.
"2nd time in the R&G Lounge for their excellent Salt & Pepper Crab - Ummmm!  Highly recommend.  You must book, even for a Monday night, as we did!"
"This place was recommended to us by a friend and it's a block of the main street in china town. We sat down after 5 mins of waiting. We ordered the seafood combination clay pot, treasure island surprise and the duck soup. It was delicious, the price was very reasonable for it and we would definitley go back. We saw multiple tables with fried crab which also looked good. The ambiance was more of locals having dinner which was a good sign that this place was good and it was busy the whole time."
"I had hot and sour soup and the wife had duck soup. Both were rich in flavor, next came the special beef. Large plate of tender beef with a braised crunchiness.  The wife had garlic mixed seafood with noodles. Very flavorful.  I'd go  back again."
"Salmon avocado egg roll, prawns and snow peas, salt and pepper spare ribs were our meals, Food was good not great. We got there before 9 pm not realizing the kitchen closes at 9:30 pm. We were rushed, asked at 9:10 if we wanted any thing else. 

The table behind us was cleared and food was set out for the staff to eat. 

First time for me that the kitchen ran restaurant and the customers were not the important part of the picture.

The place was very busy when we arrived so I know it is good my experience was not great."
"We don't have high expectations re ambiance when we go to eat in Chinatown in San Francisco and we weren't disappointed at the R&G Lounge when they took us downstairs to our table in the windowless basement.  But that was a mixed blessing since at least we could hear ourselves think, unlike on the main floor where the din was deafening.  The food, on the other hand, was top notch, which is what you go to Chinatown for.  So if you're prepared to overlook your surroundings and enjoy a very tasty and expertly prepared meal, we can recommend this restaurant.  By the way, make reservations -- we did and were shown right to our table, passing by a very long line waiting to be seated."
"I was in San Francisco in early August for business and at the recommendation of my local colleague, stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon around 3 PM. I sat at the bar as I was a solo diner. The food was amazing. I went with the dried scallop friend rice and the R&G Special Beef. I also had a pot of hot tea as it was a little chilly out. Everything blew my mind! I ate until I was stuffed and then took the rest back to my hotel, which I had later that night. I didn't want to waste a single morsel. Highly recommended and the best meal I had in SF!"
"I dined at R&G Lounge with my husband recently and was very impressed with their food. We like Asian food and have tried many places. We both think R&G is one of the best. We had the Salt & Pepper Crab, Salt & Pepper Pork Ribs, Roasted Duck, and Combination Pan Fried Noodles. All four dishes were very good. Four dishes sounds like a lot of food for two people...Normally it is, but we really enjoyed them and just noticed that we almost finished everything when we were done. In terms of the Salt and Pepper Crab and Pork Ribs, we think they really have the batter down to a science. It was light, crispy, and seasoned perfectly. 

Call and make a reservation for dinner as there is always a long line outside. Late lunch would also work since they still serve the full menu. Either way, make sure to try this place if you are visiting SFO."
The R&G Lounge was recommended by a tour guide and Zagat but we were disappointed.  The service was good and the servers were friendly but we didn't finish most of our food.  I think the problem was that we didn't know what to order as everyone around us seemed to be loving their meals.
"The absolute best salt and pepper crabs, lobster, shrimp, and scallops.
Tried these dishes in other major cities and countries but all fell short.
Just the right amount of spice - finger licking good!
Ambience and service is not impressive. Food is great and salt and pepper dishes the best.
Highly recommended."
Several years ago a man on the street recommended R & G Lounge to us and boy was he right!  The food is delisious and the staff are friendly - making for a pleasant dining experience.  Each time I visit the city I'm sure to return.  Have been there at least 4 times now and am planning to return again in September.  This time I will be ordering the Salt and Pepper Crab.  I have seen may locals enjoying the dish as well as watching Anthony Bourdain's review!  Give it a try - you won't be disappointed.
Yum!  This is great food- try the fried seafood items.  The batter is very light and crispy.  Lots of locals dine here.
"white tablecloth, suited waiters, wonderful Chinese food, very reasonable prices - wish I could eat there every week"
Seemed like there were many local and regular customers here but we were greeted by very friendly hostess and seated immediately . Appreciated that the menu displayed pictures of the dishes because the food was certainly different from what we get at our suburban Philadelphia Chinese. Best dishes were the avocado spring rolls and the honey crusted prawns with walnut. I am hot & sour soup fan and theirs was particularly flavorful. Definitely R & G lives up to its high ratings.
Looked at the menu and it was way too expensive for what you were getting.  We bailed out of there.  The restaurant decor was absolutely nothing special.
"GOOD FOOD.  Based on reviews you'd think this place was bad -- on the contrary, I quite liked it.  And I didn't think it was ""American"" at all.  Went with two friends, we ordered a bunch of stuff and all sampled.  We had the:

1) Veggie Egg Rolls - flaky, good flavor, excellent sauce
2) Winter Melon Soup - not my favorite, but that's just me.  Friends loved it, said it was flavorful.
3) Kiang Ton Spareribs - flavorful, fall of the bone tender.
4) Kung Pao Chicken - vibrant, good kick, but not too overpowering.
5) R&G Special Beef - my favorite, a secret sauce that i will spend the rest of my life trying to replicate
6) Peking Duck - tender, flavorful
7) Chow Mein - this is how chow mein should be!  Excellent.

None of our food was greasy, it was delivered in a timely manner, presented well.  The food was very good, we stuffed ourselves silly.  Between the three of us it was about $140 including tip, not unreasonable for the amount of food we got and for being in SF.

I'd go back.  That says a lot."
"Their soups are quite good.  Started with their Seafood and Bean Curd soup, which is quite nice.  Subtle seafood and tofu flavors in a white broth.  I would order this again. For the entree I had one of their house specialities -- Three Treasures with Black Bean Sauce.  Enjoyed this one a lot, too.  Nice, well-seasoned thick broth with lots of flavor.  I really liked the hot peppers stuffed with shrimp.

The atmosphere was upscale, though a bit noisy.  We ate in their upstairs dining room, which is larger than the main floor dining (I think).

While not bad, the worst part of the experience was the wait.  This restaurant was *busy*."
"Let's admit that a lot of the buzz for the R&G comes from Tony Bourdain featuring the joint on his tv show, and enjoying the salt and pepper crab.  I'm glad Tony enjoyed himself, but the food is really pretty average for a quality Chinese restaurant, and frankly it's so hard to get a table it might make sense just to skip this Bourdain Bump recipient and eat at one of the other innumerable pretty-good Chinese-American places in SF.

My travel companion (and son) Alex and I tried to get a table when we arrived in SF on a Friday night but the entrance was swarming with people, like the entrance to a beehive. We were a bit intimidated and went elsewhere. We resolved to return and did so on our last night in SF, a Monday, this time girded by reservations. We had a bit of a wait, not very long, I'd say maybe 15 minutes. We were ushered downstairs to a noisy and rather warm little room, given menus and then ignored for about the next fifteen minutes, long after we'd decided what we wanted. 

Finally we got a chance to order:

Egg rolls (greasy)
Salt and pepper crab (see below)
Peking duck (fatty and with some gristle -- ok but nothing to write home about)

There were sticky buns with the duck, but we got no rice at all -- pretty odd for a Chinese restaurant. 

I got one of those lychee martinis Bourdain had and it's a bit sour. 

A note on the famous crab -- I had had Dungeness crab at the Crab House at fisherman's wharf a few days before and enjoyed it more there. Yes, the batter and frying at R&G adds some interesting flavor accents, but at an incredible cost!  By the time you're done eating even half of a crab you'll feel like you've dunked your hands in cooking oil, then sprinkled them with crunchy bits of batter. What a mess!  R&G does provide one of those humongous handiwipes, however. 

Overall the meal was fine, and anyone eating fried and battered crab should really expect it to be an epic mess.  But in our opinion the wait and the hype are not justified by the meal."
"we ordered Peking Duck - it was perfect... absolutely perfect. We were seated quickly without a reservation, ordered Asian pea pods and shrimp - we got so many shrimp we couldn't eat them all. I was stuffed when I left. Since we went at last call, which was pretty early we didn't get our tea refreshed but other than that we were treated well and the food is worth the walk to get there. If you are staying at the Hilton in Financial district its a block away."
"As said, food were average and small portioned. The signature crab was too oily and lost the fresh and natural taste. Red clam was sandy, which the manager claimed to happen some time. Service was terrible  since I refused the waiter's suggestion of ordering one and half portion of shark fun soup. Other dishes were non-memorable.
If possible, please choose somewhere else."
"I'm Asian-American, brought up on home cooking, and have traveled Asia.  This place is the real deal; from the authentic food to the hectic, jam-packed atmosphere.  Great drinks (my wife and son loved the lychee martinis) and diverse food selections. Salt n Pepper Crab and fried rice were top notch.  Would go there again, but this place is not for someone expecting a ""westernized"" Chinese restaurant."
"My friend and I checked this place out since it seemed to be highly rated for Chinatown and the food seemed authentic. We split a variety of dishes, including the Salt and Pepper Crab, Peking Duck and Garlic Noodles. The noodles were the highlight of the meal. The crab was a greasy mess that was next to impossible to eat. Trying to crack the crabs with all the oil on the outside became a dangerous event. The duck was good but again swimming in grease. We both walked away displeased and slightly nauseous from all the grease. For these three entrees and waters out total was $120 which was ridiculous considering the food. Normally you can get so much food for a great price in Chinatown, this place is nothing more than a rip off."
"Yes, I understand that Bourdain ate here.  Yes, they have the usual Zagat posters hangining in the lobby.  Yes, I understand that they are a tourist place.  But I still think it's over rated.  I was not terribly impressed by the food or the atmosphere.  I actually was puzzled by the breaded and fried hardshell crab.  I've never heard of such a thing!?  Who breads hard shell crab?!  It was kind of odd and a lil awkward to crack.  I had fun with my colleagues, but I wouldn't put this on a list of places to return to... not in a city with so many better options!"
"This place was recommended. Our table was next to a filthy fish and lobster tank. The fish tank had a dead fish. Needless to say, I ordered the roasted eggplant. The food was good, but all throughout our visit I kept wondering what the kitchen looked like. I will never go back."
"Their signature dish, salt and pepper crab, was excellent. The baked black cod was unbelievably tender and tasty. I am waiting for the next visit to try the duck specialties and clay pot specialties.

Service was slow and there is no atmosphere, but the food is worth it."
"We were directed here by the concierge of our hotel, specifically looking for a good Chinatown meal. From Fishermans Wharf about a 25 minute walk but easy to find. We arrived just before 9 on a Tuesday evening and the place was packed.  A short wait at the bar and as they close at 9.30 they asked if we minded sharing a table.  Fine with us but imagined a table for four or something.  Turned out to be a large round table in a private room set out for four groups. Nicely separated, and amusing in they way they scrabbled to find space somewhere, made for a good atmosphere.  We food itself was simply delicious, perfectly cooked, good portion sizes - we both felt it was one of the best chinese meals we had ever had and by far and away the best and most memorable meal of our trip."
"My family decided to grab some take-out and decided to go for the R&Gat Kearny.  Both dishes was terrible.  The chicken was wAy over-cooked and tasteless without the sauce.

The fried fish made up for the lack of favor fr the chicken.  The fish was in the most salty sauce I have had.  A complete disappointment."
"We were absolutely starving and I had read on T.A. that this was the best option in China town, can not be, or the food in China town is all bad. Food came out as it was ready, which was fine, so an entree came out before the appetizer. Really didn't care because we were so hungry. 

Egg rolls were normal egg rolls, BBQ beef was ok, a bit greasy and no vegetables or anything along side of it. Pork dish from the appetizer menu was not very good at all. 

They don't offer water and we were so thirsty from our walk and then eating Chinese food. Skip it, go to Italian Food."
"This restaurant has been a top Chinese restaurant in San Francisco for many years.  It is frequented not only by the lunch crowd from Financial District but also packed with dinner crowd from around the world.  Try the crab (stirred fried with ginger and onion, also fried crabs), R&G beef, soy sauce chicken, stuffed tofu, fried chicken (whole).  Downstairs is normally for local and can be noisy.  Ground floor and second floor are quieter.  The service is much better than usual Chinese restaurant.  Restrooms are cleaner too.  The rating is mainly on the food.  Even wanton noodle soup is very good.  Reservation is highly recommended.  You may not get your table right away but should get it in 15 minutes."
"Based on the reviews in Trip Advisor my husband and I decided to venture off the main street in Chinatown to have lunch at the unpretentious and oddly named R & G Lounge.  On entering the restaurant we were led downstairs to a crowded room with tired decor packed with Asian families engaged in lively discussion. While examining the huge menu we each had a small bowl of hot and sour soup.  The soup was very average.  However, the prawn and snow pea dish that followed was excellent--a definite must try.  We then moved onto their signature salt and pepper dungeness crab which almost every group in the restaurant also had on their table.  Deep fried in batter it was definitely different and the taste did not disappoint.  Although a little challenging to eat it was clear why it was such a hit with those in the know.  Even though we were  almost full by this time we decided to end our meal with the Peking Duck since it also appeared to be on almost every table around us.  The duck was good but did not compare with the Peking Duck that we have had in other places, most notably ( but not surprisingly) in Beijing.  Overall our lunch at the R & G Lounge was a success.  The tired decor notwithstanding we enjoyed the food and the lively tables surrounding us kept us entertained."
"Pretty traditional, but great food.

Crab legs with breading were really well done.  Roast chicken is moist, crispy skin.  Stir fried vegetables were perfect.  Even the tea was above average."
"The place was packed with locals, always a good sign.  We had a reservation and otherwise it would have been a long wait.  The chicken in ginger scallion sauce was marvelous.  It is the only Chinese restaurant I have ever been to in which there is no rice included in the meal, so plan accordingly if you want rice, soup, and egg rolls."
"This restaurant had the best Peking duck I've ever tasted. We tried bird's nest soup for the first time and found it very savory. We then discovered the origin of the soup and decided this was not fair to the birds so we may not have it again, but we really enjoyed the experience which will now become unique."
"I could spend weeks exploring Chinatown and all the little restaurants here!  We chose R&G because we had so little time and the reviews on TA led us here!  We were not disappointed.  I had the Lemon chicken and Hubby tried the Kung Pao Chicken.  Both were very mild, frsh and very reasonably priced.   I must say that the service was outstanding...Very friendly and welcoming from all staff.  You walk in off the street and immediately greeted by a smile---we descended douwnstairs to a family, casual sit down meal (greatly appreciated after walking the hills of Chinatown all morning). Daughter wanted Only ""the best wonton soup she could find"" and was not disappointed-she picked up the bowl to slurp out every last drop!"
"The restaurant came highly recommended to us by our hotel staff but I wouldn't be rushing back.  The special beef was a highlight but everything else was pretty average.  The service was rather disappointing, we felt like cash cows on a conveyor belt."
"You'd better have a reservation cuz the line is insane!  We visited on a Tuesday night and the line filled the lobby and the entire street corner.  Service was great, very attentive staff til it got crazy busy but they would still come by right away when called.  Crab is their specialty and it's quite good.  I loved the sea bass!!!  Everything else was decent and we will definitely go back again."
We took the whole family here for a Chinese dinner.  The food was very good and the service was exceptional.  It appeared that the staff had a real team approach.  The price was very reasonable.  It was crowded but obviously very popular.  We would go back again next time we are in San Francisco.
"We were visiting SF with my parents and asked the Doormen at the Omni for his recommendation. (I find doormen are a great for dining advice) He pointed us on a 3 block walk to what seemed to be a small corner resturant with a long line. 

The line went fast as there was ample seating up and downstairs. This was without questions the best Chinese meal I've ever had. I had the R & G specail steak. It was mouth watering. Everyone at the table enjoyed their dishes equally.

Reason price for five star flavor"
Researched before coming to town to find a good Chinese place where locals went.  Was not disappointed.  Unbelievable food and most patrons were local.  Try their Lychee Martini.
"Hey, if you are looking for somewhere romantic with lots of ambiance, you probably wouldn't be choosing a Chinese restaurant, no? The other reviewers have said it; the salt & pepper crab is to die for, as are the Lychee margaritas. The smoked black cod is simply amazing. Matter of fact every dish we had was outstanding. But make sure you make a reservation or it's a long wait. But a worthwhile wait."
This restaurant was recommended to us by everyone we talked to. there was a wait of approximately 30 minutes which indicated to us the popularity of this restaurant. It definitely lived up to expectations as the food was excellent and well worth the wait.  The menu had an extensive selection of seafood plus the traditional Chinese selections.  The staff was attentive and very efficient.  I will definitely stop in again the next time I am in San Francisco.
"Reservations are a must here, and be prepared to be overwhelmed by the noisy chaos when you try and enter the restaurant (even on a weekday).  This is not a place for a long, quiet dinner, and the service is lackluster, at best.  However, the food is definitely interesting and some dishes (like the Peking duck with buns) are worth trying.  My son (11) loved the honey bbq ribs (but I question the quality of the meat).  We were looking for a SF-China Town experience, and I think the restaurant qualifies from that perspective."
"Overall, lychee martini, salt & pepper crab, and service excellence. 
A must go, on your visit to SF !"
"We stopped by this place because the Salt & Pepper Crab is so famous it gone them onto Bourdain's show.

We ordered just that and the crab was so large we could not finish it in one sitting and had to crack it ourselves and put it in a doggy bag to go ... it did make a great last meal in the SFO Airport Food Court though!!"
"We stopped by for dinner before the ballgame. Dinner was a lot better than the ballgame! 
Food was perfect, but the rates was a bit too high."
"We had dinner on a Monday night. The place was very busy, it was only a 10 minute wait. We ordered the roast duck, fried rice and special beef. The roast duck was amazing, juicy, crispy and full of flavour."
"It appears my stop at this restaurant was a bit better than some of the other reviews.  It was recommended by a very aggressive shop salesman and my wife and I decided to try it for lunch.  I always test the smell of any restaurant or grocery on first entering to see if I want to eat or buy there and the first impression was good.  Not really a fancy place, but we weren't looking for that.  Just a nice quick lunch and on to more sightseeing.  When we went downstairs to the eating area we noticed mostly well dressed Chinese business men and women and a couple of folks like us.  We thought that was a plus and it was busy.  We both had selections off the lunch menu and the food was very good with adequate portions.  We both would eat here again."
"Tried this place on the recommendation of a couple of local people.   I had the Peking duck, which I had never had before.  The skin was crispy and the meat had an interesting flavor.   Don't know that the dumplings added much to the meal, but it was good overall.  My husband had mixed seafood, which had a very light sauce that let the shrimp, scallops and squid show off their flavors.    The avocado and salmon egg roll was fabulous .  Service was fine,  atmosphere was entertaining, with great people watching."
"Odd name for 3 story Chinese restaurant in SF Chinatown.  Extensive menu with some special dishes like salt and pepper crab, special beef, etc.  Food very good, interesting."
"This resto is known for the crab, they are sort of OK. We tried the Peking duck as well (it is our ""standard"" to compare the various restaurants), it was sort of OK..... with very strange pancakes that reduced considerably the pleasure of eating the food !!!! Quantity are enormous, but for our European eyes  and stomachs, ALL the portions in US are ENORMOUS !!!! :)
The resto is divided into two parts, the first floor is clean, the underground is horrible. Overall, nothing to write home about it......"
"We chose this restaurant by using the internet and it had very high reviews. We had no reservation, they were crowded when we walked up, wait time was 30-45 minutes, they gave us a card with a number on it and we were told to come back in 20-30 minutes and they would let us know when we would be seated. It seems typical of the restaurants all around Chinatown. We walked around a bit, came back and were seated right away in the main floor dining, even though we were skeptical due to a LARGE tour bus of Japanese tourists out front. Service was polite, efficient. White table cloths, pot of tea on seating and questions answered quickly. 
I honestly can't remember what either one of us ordered for entrees, but the hot and sour soup was good- too many mushrooms for my taste and lots of meat- more broth less ""stuff"" please?
There were many multi-generation Asian families eating there and they had some of the more traditional foods brought to their tables. Think whole chicken with feet.
The meal itself did not knock my socks off, but was seasoned well and ok for Chinese food. I've had better. 
So, not great, not terrible. I might or might not choose to go there again if I visited SF again."
"There was great anticipation for this restaurant as it was visited by Anthony Bourdain. I had to make a reservation three weeks out to get a decent time for my birthday dinner. When we arrived, the place was packed with wait times in the hour range. I say average because the food was good, and I can't really justify a rating of poor. However, we did not find it be better than many places we frequent at home (Chicago). It's overpriced and you are rushed out of the restaurant by very cold serving staff. I wish I had done a bit better research to find a different place. Don't waste your time with a wait that could be hours long, and if you are anticipating an expensive dinner spend it at another place that could be more worth it."
"We arrived right when they opened and was the third party to get a table. The restaurant is down in the basement. Not quite the ambience I was expecting for the price of food. Service was swift. At times too swift (I'm not done with that!) Overall, not bad at all. We ordered the overrated greasy, salty stomach-churning salt and pepper crab. Have no idea why people are raving about this awful $40 dish. If you want steamed rice, its extra. Yes, extra. $1/pp. We also ordered half a peking duck and the honey walnut shrimp. Duck fat was rendered to making for perfect, crispy skin. Prawns were huge for the honey walnut shrimp and not too much mayo. Expect your dishes to come out when they're ready - not together. They are all about turning tables here. Duck and shrimp were priced right under $20 but I'm still mad about the crab. It is nasty. Save your money."
"A nice choice for lunch - atmosphere transports you to China or Taiwan for those who've been there.  Authentic menu.  If I have one criticism, it would be that the hot & sour soup was not great...very spicy, but just OK."
"On a second visit to this popular Chinese Restaurant across from the Hilton there was a nearly 1 inch size roach creature in my noodle plate. Ok that's bad but what was worse is the waiter didn't really care. He acted like it wasn't all that unusual to find a whole bug in a fried noodle plate.   

He took the plate away and yes I had already eaten some and took the plate off our bill but we still got charged for the other dishes. And no real apology at all. 

I sent a photo to the SF Health dept who I thought would folllow up but have never heard from them so I doubt it.

 I know this is a popular place but beware and cautious."
"MAKE RESERVATIONS. We were lucky to come just before a mad rush. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes. We waited in their small, upscale lounge (facade). Over 40 minutes later we were told our table was ready. We went downstairs. This place is a slippery mess. The floors are slippery, the chairs are slippery and are uncomfortable, the place is very noisy and it just has an overall ""ew"" feeling. The food is EXCEPTIONAL.  The food arrives when ready, not all at once. The rice and/or noodles are not included with the meal. Do not order the short ribs (not sure what we were eating and it was very messy) The wait staff was great. are a family of four and paid $100 for Chinese food (no drinks). Wow! Loved the food, but we can't afford this place. You could easily split meals and be satisfied."
We have eaten here twice now with our son's wife's family who are Chinese. What an awesome restaurant!! The food is amazing and the service is excellent! The deep fried crab is our favorite! For a real treat try the lobster sashimi. BBQ sea bass is also a hit with our family! Love R&G!!
"If you like Chinese food, this is the restaurant for you.  The food is without compare.  The service is friendly, and very prompt.  The Sezchuan eggplant is perfect, as is the Peking Duck, and the various noodle dishes.  It's a true study ""in correct.""  These people care, and it shows."
Don't expect to eat your meal at the same time as your dining partners.  My meal came at least 5 minutes before my dining partner's.  The service is poor.  The waiter never checked back with us.  We had to get up and hunt our waiter down to get service.  This is a first!
"My wife overhead some folks on the tour bus talking about the R & G, so went to check it out.  Luckily, we called ahead for a reservation because there was a line outside the door (and on a Monday night).  It reminded me of a Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong -- bright, crowded, loud and noisey, and a a very nice place to go.  It had the most extensive offering of Chinese food that I had ever seen.  I had the pork and it was very good and most tasty.  The price was reasonable.  A fun time overall."
"We were going to go shopping in China Town and my wife had got s recommendation for this  restaurant, so after having exhausted the credit cards, we set off to find it. After about a 10 minute walk, “it’s just the next block” type of walk, we turned right down to a main road, turned right again and there was the R & G Lounge. 
It was packed with so many people queuing at the reception desk, and not having a reservation, we thought that we would never get in. 
Anyway, we were sat down and asked to wait around 50 minutes. After about 10 minutes the maître de asked us if we would be happy to share a table, to which we agreed. The food was served very quickly, was excellent and I felt had a very authentic taste.
We had a most agreeable meal with 2 ladies from North Carolina on a course with the Wells Fargo Bank, and a young couple on holiday from Tennessee. He was an attorney and she was an accountant. 
All very chatty and made the evening go even better than we hoped. If they read this, thanks for helping to make our evening more enjoyable.
Definitely one to recommend, but do book ahead!"
"My partner and I recently had dinner at R & G on the recommendation of several friends (as well as restaurant reviews) in San Francisco, and it did not disappoint! Busy, crowded and loud, R & G was worth the noise and the short wait. We had the signature salt & pepper crab, honeyed spareribs, and a special green beans with pork that was prepped by special request for us. Service is quick and efficient, and the crowd is exciting and glad to be there. I don't recommend it for a quiet romantic dinner for two, but if you're up for some good Chinese fare in a clamorous, loud room that feels like a real part of Chinatown, be sure to go to R & G."
My first day in SF I decided to check this place out for a quick lunch due to it being somewhat close to my hotel.  I was not really impressed with anything about this place.  I ordered the popular Salt & Pepper Crab after reviewing the extensive menu they have.  The crab was just so-so and was very disappointed.  The service was average as well.  I would give this place a second chance but I would definitely order something else.
"I actually came to R & G Lounge for the praise by people about the peking duck, nothing that i expected, firstly i'm a solo traveller, i arrived when the restaurant was quiet and was promptly seated in a traffic area so i felt like eating and getting out of there, the duck was cooked well but the only way i could put it was hacked up causing small slivers of bone which i had to pick out' yes i have had peking duck before, the restaurant was not up to my expectations"
"I was told that this is the best food in Chinatown. What a disappointment. My food was average, nothing exceptional. I had to ask our waiter for rice, twice. It seemed to me that all of the other Asian customers had theirs delivered with their meal. I got the feeling we weren't welcome. Staff was not friendly and the food was similar to what could be had from a food court at the mall."
"There is definitely a wait and it's worth it for the Salt & Pepper Crab alone.  This was our first time here and everything we read gave it great reviews. Food was fresh, flavorful and plenty to share with a group."
"Best crab I've ever had.  Ordered the salt and pepper crab and it was delicious! Chow Mein was a little different, but still good."
"We had seen Anthony Bourdain's piece on this place and he was over the moon about it, and in fact there wasn't a seat in the house at 6PM on a Friday night. Many tables of six or more. The specialty is crab, served several different ways...we ordered the house special. It was okay, Tasty. Not fabulous. The lychee martinis were just okay as well. We were sorry that we didn't return to Oriental Pearl, a better Cantonese experience."
"We ate here last week and highly recommend it. We had the salt and pepper crab, shaking beef, honey walnut prawns, Chinese greens and the salmon and avocado egg rolls. everythign was expertly prepared, service was excellent. Most of the customers were locals...very few tourists. Two thumbs up. We shall return. Reservations are recommended."
"Extensive menu with both authentic and ""American Chinese"" dishes. Seafood in a clay pot and duck were excellent. Service is good, even though the restaurant seems like it's always packed. Don't linger at your table, though, because they'll remove the table cloth in a ""it's time to go now"" fashion -- it's that busy!"
"We eat seafood soup, clay pot and peking duck with spring pancakes. All meals vere tasty and well done (ok, duck had bones in it, that was mistake). Serving was fast and easy. It seems that service vary quite a much time to time."
"Every time we've stayed at the San Francisco Ritz-Carlton we've made our way down the hill to Kearny Street to the R & G Lounge for dinner (it's the walk back up to the hotel that's the killer). This Hong Kong-style eatery is a classic. It's friendly (the staff is great), neighborly (you feel like a regular), and downright delicious (self-defining). Over the years we have enjoyed all manner of claypot recipes (the chicken with onion is a favorite), classics (honey barbeque ribs), and specials (salt and pepper crab . . . see photo). 

Not sure why ""Lounge"" is in the name? Visit the street-level floor and find out why. This is a great place to spend time figuring it out; just have the crab plate in front of you while you do . . ."
"i don't know why this restaurant has the best reviews online...but because of it all tourists(including us)were headed that way. it was too packed and the service was extremely slow. i don't usually care about the service, i come to restaurants for the food but this was unusually slow. from the outside it looks like it's a new decorated place but that's just a bar area. the eating area is downstairs in the stuffy basement with no windows and poor light. all the kids in the restaurant,including ours,were cranky and couldnt wait to get out...probably because of overpowering smells coming from the kitchen and stuffiness. the good part is they do not have usual chinese food menu. food is different and pretty good. oh yeah, and nothing comes with rice so you have to pay $3 for a small bowl of rice...when i asked for a box they boxed everything but rice...did not understand why they thought i wouldn't take it if i payed for it? overall...a tourist trap."
"We knew that this place got rave reviews, and we were looking forward to having Peking Duck (one of their specialties).  We ordered the half duck, since it was only two people.  We also decided to order the Salt and Pepper Prawns - since they supposedly do all the Salt and Pepper stuff really well.

We were sitting near the fish tanks - with some half-dead lobsters and mostly dead prawns.  (We didn't notice the dead stuff until some time after we ordered our food, or we would have reconsidered the prawns.)

So they brought out our Salt and Pepper Prawns, and they were decent, although not even close to the top of what we have had in the past in NY/NJ.

Then they brought out a plate of the smallest half-duck we have ever seen (it appeared to be missing some pieces) - and it was hacked up just like a roast duck (not sliced like a peking duck).  They brought us a few of the doughy steamed buns, and that was it.  We had to ask for the hoisin sauce and scallions (that normally come with peking duck).  When they brought it, we asked why we got roast duck and not peking duck.  Also - we asked how we were supposed to put the slices of meat on the buns when it was still on the bone and wasn't cut properly.  They said ""this is how we do it here"".  I explained that we KNOW what peking duck is supposed to be, and this isn't it.  They basically ignored us after that.  

OK - we're not experts on specific cuisines, but I have had enough peking duck (and roast duck) in my life to know this was just wrong.  (I have eaten at the Peking Duck House in NY, other places in Chinatown in NJ, and numerous places in NJ, and my partner also had Peking Duck at R&G previously several year ago, and they did it CORRECTLY then.)

This was our first dinner in San Francisco, and it was BEYOND disappointing.  Clearly, they simply don't give a darn about what they serve, and we will NEVER return, nor will we ever recommend this place.

For good Chinese food, there are SO MANY BETTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE places to go.   Don't waste your money here."
My sister and I were in SF on business and I was craving some peking duck. Read the reviews for R&G Lounge and trusted the positive ones. We were overally disappointed. It seemed more of a tourist trap than anything else. The service was poor and it took forever to get a waiter (even though we sat RIGHT beside the kitchen door!). We had ordered the peking duck and salt and pepper scallops. The peking duck was extremely fatty and had very little meat on it. It felt like I was eating an oily bun. Yumm?? NOT! ( On another note: the buns were delicious!! I ended up eating those on their own with the cucumbers and hoisin sauce)  The salt and pepper scallops were another oily mess. It was the pricest 'heart attack' in a plate of food I have ever had.
"We were recommended by a friend to eat here and order this dish.  We were glad we did, but you must know it is HUGE!  we ordered the crab, Mongolian beef, and a noodle dish.  

I asked if it would be enough food for two, but really I should have asked for another couple to join us...

Absolutely delicious and no regret, other than we were soo full from lunch!

great hole in the wall and great crab!"
"Recommended by a friend, this place had a lot of locals eating there. That's always a good sign . The house version of red pepper oil was the best I had ever had. It have some good heat, but way better flavor than most I have tried. My salt and pepper squid were tender and tasty. They bring you hot tea when you sit down which was a nice touch. Service was polite. I would go back."

"A place in old china town, atmosphere was not up to date and they seated us down stairs. They had one server who was very fast and a wall of tanks with fresh seafood! We ordered the duck with sticky buns, Mongolian beef, salt and pepper scallops, chow me in and fried rice. It was a little pricy but worth it for the fresh seafood. Definitely not what you would expect by looking at it."
"One goes for the food!  Ignore the wait, or call ahead for take-out.  Just eat.  Fresh ingredients, well prepared with tons of flavor."
"Met a friend here on a busy Friday night (make reservations!). We had a few cocktails and ordered the house special beef as well at the salt and pepper crab.

The crab was really good. My only problem was I didn't realize how greasy it was going to be and I ended up getting stuff all over my pants. But that's ok. Would I eat here again? Yes. I would like to try some other items on their menu. Their cocktails are strong but really good!"
i have had great Chinese food in my day but this actually was on eof the worst i have had. Everyone told me about the fried crab but it ended up being a dripping soggy mess
"We ate here about a year and a half ago and loved it.  It was in mid-Dec on a Sunday night, the place was packed.... had to wait 20 min or so to get in, were seated upstairs and loved our food.  Looked forward to going back on this trip, but was disappointed.  Monday night, not busy, were seated immediately in the basement.  By the fish tank.  Not very pleasant. Had an app of chicken satay, which was extremely bland.  The sauce had no flavor.  I know, satay is NOT a dish of Chinese origin, but still.  When we told the waiter, he just kind of blew it off.  Lemon chicken: OK.  I let the waiter talk me into the fried crab.  I should have stayed with my instinct and ordered something I knew I liked, (like a duck dish), but I had read so much about the salt & pepper crab that I ordered it.  Not something I cared for at all.  Greasy and a pain to crack open to eat.  From the previous reviews, I guess if you like it, this place is the place to go, but if I go back, I will stay away from the satay and crab, and order a duck dish."
"San Francisco, Chinatown great weather and a visit with the grandkids.  It does not get any better unless you do the Dungeness Crabs.  Really really good,  The shrimp in honey and walnut was also a wonderful choice.  Service very good and all in all a neat place to eat."
"Saw this place on Anthony Bourdain's show and so I thought you can't go wrong with it.Place was packed,you can park at the garage and have it validated free for 2 hrs,have a tour around Chinatown make the visit worthwhile.Crabs are good (I'm not much of a crab guy,)the Peking duck and the ""special beef"" were excellent. Service was okay,facility was decently clean including the bathrooms."
"Probably not a good idea to go to a Cantonese restaurant in the US less than a week after eating some pretty tasty food in Chengdu in Sichuan Province, but Chinatown was on the punchlist, it came highly recommended, and a large party from the Chinese delegation that will be hosting the next conference (our reason for being in SF that week) in Beijing was headed out as we were headed in, so we took that as a good sign.  

But after all that, it was pretty disappointing- good quality, reasonable portions, but just not very interesting.  Even though it was fairly late on a Sunday, it took us a few minutes to get a table, but they transferred our drink bill to the table (something more restaurants should do- I know it complicates things when distributing tips, but c'mon, WE are the customer!)  Food came quickly, as did the Anchor Steam (unfortunately, most Chinese beers are no better than most American beers, so it's always good to have a good local like Sam Adams in Boston or Fat Tire in Fort Collins to fall back on)

"We arrived just after 9pm on a Monday evening. The man serving us was very abrupt and impolite. The food was just about ok, but pretty disappointing."
There are few places in which you can find dungeness crabs that are fried. It's one of their staple dishes. We shared 1 crab for 2 people = $38. It has an authentic taste. We were stuffed with food. There's no room for dessert!
"Im a huge fan of Chinese food and when visiting San fran for the first time we had no idea which was to choose as there are so many! So we literally googled it and came up with this place.. what a find!! We had a wait of around 40 mins and the place was packed! That's always a good sign if you ask me.. The place was full of locals so in my opinion if the Chinese say its good.. its good!!! They specialize it crabs and EVERYONE seemed to order this!! Unfortunalty we didn't as our budget was very tight (they cost $38) Kind of wished we had just gone for it tho!! I had the special beef and omg it was the best thing ive tasted!! If I am ever lucky enough to go back to San Fran, I will be sure to give this place another visit!"
"Heard about the salt and pepper battered crab served here.  
And no doubt the crab was delicious.  However it was $40.  I like crab but not that much.
Otherwise everything was very tasty.
Overall good food but expensive."
"So, Jump off the Bart at Montgomery or the cable car on California and Kearney and make this your first stop! Always amazing choices, try the shrimp and noodles or honey and garlic chicken for lunch. Exceptional quality, generous portions to share. reasonable prices, good service.  Not fancy, but consistent and notches above other Chinatown restaurants.

"We took a small family trip with our daughter,son in law and grandkids to San Francisco and of course Chinatown is a must for great chinese food. R&G Lounge came through with some of the best chinese food in the city but the most impressive food was the lightly battered deep fried crab and it was the one thing our 9 yr old grandson wanted he was one happy boy! R&G Lounge have the best crab in town!  The service was also very nice."
"Who knows what to expect when going into a Chinese restaurant? Especially in Chinatown. 
The place is modernly designed, very clean, no odor. Mostly Chinese people in long wait for a table, with a few whites mixed in. 

It is a little noisy which adds to the positive vibe. I have not been to the bar but I like the tv with normally a popular American sporting event on display.

The staff is very attentive, shy and quiet. They do their job and don't say much: perfect.

The food is incredible. Fresh delicious fish with subtle delicious flavors. Crab was one of best items I've ever had. 

Food, atmosphere, service. There's nothing better..."
"No reservations on Easter Sunday for dinner and just lucked out to find this option. We were seated in a private room with the biggest glass carousel on the table I have ever seen. We agreed to be out by 730pm as they had a group scheduled but never felt rushed even though we didn't finish until 8pm! The special beef, peking duck, shrimp and lemon chicken dishes were awesome. The martinis were also very good and the Shirley Temple was super. Remember to order rice as it isn't usually included.
The service was delightful and reminded us of the staff at the Chinese restaurant in ""A Christmas Story"". I am sure they thought we were absolutely nuts as we sang ""Deck the halls with boughs of Horry, Fa ra ra ra ra, ra ra ra ra!"" Just go! Food and service are wonderful!"
One of our favorites when we visit San Francisco. Food is awesome. Favorite is the salt & pepper crab.....yummy!  Other seafood is excellent also. Give it a try.
"Another hotel guest recommeded the restaurant.  My husband ordered their special beef menu item and it was excellent.  I had the chicken cashes and it was good, but not as favorable as the beef."
"The R and G Lounge--went for the infamous Salt and Pepper Crab and we were not disappointed. Ample portions. Delicious. Because we went before 6pm, upstairs dining room wasn't available, but we had no wait for the downstairs dining area. We really enjoyed it. Great service."
"Lucky to have gotten this recommendation from local friends.  Was fantastic... like ""Chef Chu's"" but in the city.  Catonese style, Had the Crispy Walnut Chicken, and the best Mashed Chicken & Corn Soup I've had in the USA.  Quick service, but make sure you have a reservation... when we left, line was down the sidewalk."
"This was a perfect surprise. It was off the beaten path. Less congestion, and less tourist. Natives dine here, and the food was beyond our expectation, really good. Highly recommend!"
"You can't go wrong with this place - great food, fast service and full of the Chinatown way. The Peking Duck is amazing, as also the Mellon soup with scallops and shrimp."
"We asked a sales clerk in one of the many stores in the Chinatown area for dinner recommendations.  She suggested R & G Lounge and when we walked to the restaurant it was overflowing with people - always a good sign.  We put our name on the list and waited about 20 minutes and this was on a Tuesday night.  The menu is full of great options and we were not disappointed.  Our food was superb, the staff was friendly and service was pretty quick.  We had the Mu Shu Pork, Beef Chow Mein, Chicken Chow Mein and Seafood combination bowl - our family ate every bite and we were completely satisfied with our dining experience."
"When you find a Chinese restaurant full of Chinese people, you know the food is going to be good, and it was.  The service was very fast, and prices reasonable but not cheep.  The entrance is at ground level, but the dining room is a floor down, and the decor is minimal.  The Peking Duck with white buns was delicious, but I always have trouble figuring out how to get rid of the bones, especially with no knife and having to eat the duck on the bun."
"I heard from a friend that R & G lounge is known as one of the best Chinese restaurants in San Francisco Bay Area for its traditional dishes, and after all, I agree! If you are craving for an authentic Hong Kong style food, this is the right place to have a bite after walking around in the famous Chinatown in San Francisco.  The restaurant has two levels for dining. The interior is nothing special. Anyhow, I enjoyed their tasty dim sum, the mouthwatering salt & pepper Dungeness crab and R&G special beef.  They gave us a two hours complimentary parking in the garage which is not so far from the restaurant. Service is fine. Pretty recommended."
"We were attending a three day meeting in San Francisco and wanted to try some authentic San Francisco Oriental food.  The R&G was recommended (though the person recommending told us ""it has been a long time."") by more than one person.  Including the bar tender and concierge at the Marriott.  The experience - we were quickly seated downstairs - even for a party of 5 on a busy Tuesday night.  The restaurant was very busy and looks like a lot of people do take out.  One of the people in our party had never been to San Francisco - the first thing he noticed was a dead fish in the aquarium.  Yes the one they use in food prep.  We noticed later someone kept checking the shrimp - netting them and making sure they were alive and through them back in.  The food did arrive in drips and draps...must anticipated since this is family style.  At best the food was bland.  Some of the beef was so tough it couldn't be cut with a fork.  The roasted crispy pork shoulder was ok - the best part was the crispy skin. The meat was bland.  That is the best description of the meal - bland and not prepared well.  Something would really have to change before I darken the door here again.  I'm just glad I didn't take customers with us!"
"our 8 member party was seated immediately upstairs (didn't see an elevator but mom with cane could go up holding handrail, and restroom was on that floor) snappy service, 6 dishes including a double portion of their salt and pepper deep fried crab were enough to feed 8. the spice level was mild even for dishes labeled hot. plenty of room for strollers on the second floor. directly in the parade route of Chinatown New Years Parade so reserve ahead next year, then google southwest airlines san francisco chinatown parade to get tickets in advance mailed to you---grandstand seats about a block away from restaurant. at $30 each a great bargin to sit and be able to see everything- but it's a long parade and it gets REALLY cold so bundle up!"
"First things first, the food was pretty good i'll be honest there.  The problem came when we paid for our table.  We realised when we stood up to leave that when the bill came to add on the tip, the credit card was not there.  We immediately told the waiter our problem and he quickly palmed us off.  The manager eventually came out and told us to cancel the card, we don't have it etc.  I eventually told him to show me exactly where the transactions took place, he reluctantly took me in to a room, opened up a drawer and pulled out our credit card!!!!  I grabbed it off him and while doing so, noticed another card in the drawer.  Seems to be another ""business"" going on behind closed doors here.  Unfortunately after this I would highly recommend finding somewhere else, or if you must go there, pay with cash."
Had a group dinner here on A Wednesday evening. We were lucky to get in as there was a large group waiting. We decided to have all our dishes served family style and everything was very good. The salt & pepper calamari was the best I've had. I ordered the macadamia but scallops and steak tips as my contribution to the table and loved every bite. Great service the whole time...
"R&G is a great choice for Chinese food in San Francisco, It is located slightly outside of the touristy Chinatown area.  The building is not much to look at, but the food is divine!  Try their Salt and Pepper Crab which is one of their specialities and was featured on a Anthony Bourdain ""No Reservations"" episode."
"First things first, the food was pretty good i'll be honest there.  The problem came when we paid for our table.

All the locals from Chinatown come here for the completely genuine Chinese food at reasonable prices. Shame they are ignorant of the obscenity of shark's fin soup; but you cannot have everything. Great menu for food and drink and service brisk but good.
"We felt like we had fallen into a fast food factory.  We had made reservations, but no one seemed to be looking at that and it made no difference as we were quickly shuffled into a dining room.  Fortunately we were early and got right in, not like waiting crowd we had to push through to exit.  Tables were close together and the noise level was loud.  Service was almost too prompt.  We knew what we wanted and got an order in fast.  But the sequence of service was out of whack.  Main dishes appeared before appetizers and then everything appeared all at once.  The Peking duck came almost instantly.  Not bad, but it had little flavor.  The crispy skin was good.  Moo Shu vegetables were lukewarm, over cooked, and greasy.  Salt and pepper scallops were hot and tasty!  It seemed that we were there only for minutes before plates were whisked away and we were out the door.   There are better places in the area."
"We did not try their the signature food ""salt and pepper crabs""  - and decided to go with the crispy roasted duck, the perfect Hot and Sour Soup, and enjoyed the great spring rolls. 

I really loved the atmosphere at R & G Lounge, a real Chinese Restaurant with all the noises and buzz of activities without the loud colors. and not a hole in the wall restaurant. We had no reservation and the line outside was very long when we arrived, which always is a good sign. 

We will be back soon."
"I loved my chicken clay pot dish..which was huge..and a good thing since the price for lunch was high.  My boyfriend struck out though the the chicken dish..think it was called princess chicken...not too good.  Didn't try the s&p crab dish they are known for and I was told by others is amazing.   
I'd say they know how to do their dishes right here and without a wait, it is definitely worth a visit."
"Attended a group dinner here, and the host had pre-ordered a multi-course dinner which was fabulous.  The atmosphere is raucous, and there can be odd delays between the dishes coming out, but the food was uniformly good, with some of it outstanding, and it's a wonderful place to go with a big group of friends to share time, food, and stories.

The stand-out dishes as far as I was concerned were the butterfish, which absolutely melted in your mouth, and the beef, scallops and snap-pea pod dish, with perfectly cooked scallops, succulent seasoned beef, and wonderful crisp pea pods. Just fabulous.

I don't think this would be nearly the same experience on your own, or with just a couple folks, but bring a crowd, settle in, and enjoy a wonderful evening of eating and experiencing it all."
"the R & G Lounge may sound like a bar, but its really a very small restaurant right on Kearny that makes the best fried crab!  You will see people lined up outside the restaurant waiting for a table for lunch and dinner time.  If you have a healthy appetite order the fried crab its huge or share with a friend.  If you are staying at a local hotel, have the concierge call in advance to reserve a table."
"We went for the famous salt-and-pepper crab.  Everyone told us to.  It's.... fine.  Frankly, it's a little confusing.  The batter is outside the shell, so you either have to scrape off the plain and slightly greasy batter with your teeth (and who wants to eat just batter?), or move past it and eat just the crab meat (which seems a shame since the addition of a little salt and fat is always a good thing, no?).  The crab meat itself was good, but nothing particularly special. And a final note:  the shells were pre-cracked in a way that produced quite a bit of splintering.  There isn't a buzz-kill quite like starting to chew and then encountering a shard of shell.  :(

We also had the Peking duck, which was good but again - nothing special and quite overpriced.  $16 for a half duck?  I've had better product for a better price at hole-in-the-wall mom & pop Chinese BBQ joints."
"We went here on recommendation of hotel clerk and a guest. Had the salt and pepper crab which both said to order. It is very good and very salty tasting. Be prepared to use fingers to eat and crab crackers to get at meet. One is enough for two people. Also had spicy beef on recommendation of server, it was quite good also. This is a busy place so suggest a reservation. At 6 we got seated right away, when we left at 7  there was a line waiting for tables."
"This was our last meal in SF and possibly the best. We knew we wanted the crab, and we went early to get it. But when we saw all the different ways to get it - from black bean sauce to garlic to ginger & scallion - we got a little confused. Finally ended up going with the house signature preparation: breaded with salt and pepper. This doesn't sound that great, but it turns out to be extraordinary, probably the best we've ever had."
"Yes, this place is popular.  But if I'd had these dishes as take-out and rated them not knowing where they were from, I'd have given the mushroom chow mein a C- (few mushrooms, not much flavor), the chicken and eggplant a B- for being far too oily, and only the chicken with black bean would get a B+.   Service make you feel very rushed, even at an off hour."
"So many people say this is the best Chinese food in the city, but I can't agree.  Dishes have too much sauce, and it seems like the sauce is covering up some other transgression.  The dishes don't seem fresh at all.  Overcrowded and overrated."
"In a city that should offer great Chinese food this is truly the worst I have ever had. 
Except for the edible shrimp fried rice, nothing is worth mentioning, let alone eating it."
"Everybody knows about the crab; it's their specialty item.  $38 for a whole Dungeness crab that's been fried with a ""salt & pepper"" batter.  Way over-rated in my opinion.  Veggie mu shu and hot & sour soup pretty good.  Total for 5 was $138 w/tax, tip, etc."
"We chose the R&G based on reviews and we had a nice meal but of the 4 dishes we ordered only 2 of them impressed.  The other 2 weren't bad, but could be better.  Service was good.  I'd call this an average Chinese food location.  When you enter you see only the bar, and then go downstairs to the dining room.  It's dark and there are no windows.  Fish tanks with live (and some obviously dead) fish great you which kind of weirded us out so we did not order fish.  This is a popular place though so go early if you try it."
Across from the Hilton downtown San Francisco and then downstairs from the bar. The food was great but anything with the salt and pepper seasoning was Outstanding! Service quick although the waiters a little cold.
"We had seen great things about the specialty at R&G - the salt and pepper crab, so we decided to give it a try.

I'm a big shrimp and crab fan - but I just didn't get the appeal of this particular dish:  it is impressive to look at  (a big deep fried crab, served with top shell on the plate) - but to eat it is a mess!  One is large enough to share, which my husband and I did, but the batter/frying makes handling the legs slippery and difficult, and didn't seem to really enhance the flavor of the crab that much to me.

The restaurant was packed - with a line out the door - so clearly they are doing something right... but for my husband and I, we'd pass on the specialty of the house... Too much aclaim over a dish that didn't really live up to the hype."
"I am so sad to report that the salt and pepper crab is deep fried and the grease is still sticking on my fingers. Seriously, Anthony Bourdain???  Seriously??  I am so sad because the other dishes there looked so dang tasty!!  I would go to the venue but order something (anything) else !!"
"My dad recommended this place, and it lived up to the recommendation.
Portions were a little smaller than we expected, so we ordered a couple more dishes halfway through eating.
Service was really nice.
Food was well prepared and delicious.
R&G Beef, Honey Spare Ribs, Honey Walnut Prawns, Peking Duck, all very good. Should have ordered the Salt and Pepper Crab... It looked great.
It was very busy. We saw a long waiting line when leaving.take that into account.
Since eating there, we have heard lots of people talking about this place. It seems to be well regarded in SF."
"The signature dish is the salt and pepper crab.  No need to mention this entree since Anthony Bourdain plugged it on his NR show.

But suppose you are allergic to this creature, or consider crab to be like chips, an appetizer for something more.

Let's test out the menu by ordering some typical Chinese fare.  'Best of', yes, 'must have', yes. But first we must have a placebo control.

The plates are large.  The portions are enough for two super-sized patrons. They are perfect for a party of four. The strategy then is to order a half dozen dishes.  Split them up and sample as you like, dim-sum style.

The hot and sour soup is good. It is hot on the hot and sour spectrum, chowder like instead of broth lite, and tastes fine.

The Peking duck can be ordered half or whole and comes quartered up like a sliced loaf of bread.  The skin is crisp.  The fat is absent.  The texture is tender.  The taste is neutral and has to be sexed-up with the soy and red pepper condiment.  Steamed buns are used as wraps.  Don't make the mistake of soaking the buns in the sauce as they absorb liquids like a sponge.  Dip the duck in the bath instead so that it gains more flavor.

The black mushrooms and mustard greens are visual eye candy.  The use of oyster sauce gives them a nice shine, like the waiter has buffed them up before bringing in the plate.  

The braised E-Fu noodles sound like a dish that comes with the free Wi fi service but no, they are rice noodles. The equivalent would be the Vietnamese hu tieu. Both are usually served with slices of pork.  The hu tieu is a lighter, summer fare.  The E-fu choice looks more gelatinous, the strands sticking together like white mac and cheese.  It tastes good but fills you up quickly.  This would be winter fare as you need to pack up those carbs.

The steaming bowl of fried rice with seafood also looked gelatinous.  If your taste runs toward a drier rice preference, this sticky, sushi-style rice might not be your choice.  There is some cheating going on with Surimi being used for real crab but we understand as long as the deception is not premium priced.

The tea served is nothing fancy.  It would be nice if one has a choice between jasmine or oolong, but that's fine.

Service is excellent with multiple servers whisking in full plates and removing empty ones. Turnover is the name of the game but our party never felt the rush and enjoyed the meal at a good pace.

Ah yes, the standards pass the test and more.  This sure is no placebo!"
"This is the type of place where tour buses park in front, prices are reasonable if not a touch expensive, but a very solid choice for Chinese.  Be sure to order the salt & pepper crab (expensive) and the special beef."
"We went here based on TripAdvisor and other reviews.

We had no booking but got a table for 4 quite quickly.

We ordered cocktails for our children (nearly 21 & nearly 18); other restaurants had served them a celebratory drink in the basis that they were under our supervision (I don't know the law in CA).  The waiter asked for ID, they said they didn't have any and he then went and got the drinks,  After a couple of sips he came back and said no ID no drinks.  The drinks were cancelled but the approach was confusing and annoying - an outright refusal would have been fine.

The food arrived sporadically, not together.  It was barely hot enough,  We had to ask for rice and water several times to get it.

Salt & pepper calamari was nice.  Signature beef dish was OK.  Crispy skin pork shoulder dry and not very tasty.  Snow pea & water chestnuts and a vegetable noodle dish were both stodgy and not a great experience.  Nice wine.

Overall not what we had hoped."
"We have been to this restaurant several times. The banquet menu is excellent. Our last visit was on Thanksgiving; it was extremely busyand noisy. Service was good. The salt and pepper crab is the best dish here. We made a mistake in ordering a non cantonese dish like mapo tofu, it was awful, then had a bland dish of prawn with sort of scrambled eggs. Same with the lemon chicken, bland.This is a pretty pricey place, so you expect better food. So, this time it was very disappointing!"
"The porter at our hotel recommended R & G Lounge as having good Chinese food, he was not wrong, we did not book for the Thursday evening but ad to wait about 15 mins for a table.  The restaurant is divided into rooms both upstairs and downstairs, but it seemed the clientele was both Chinese and Western, a good sign......  The menu is quite extensive and the portions generous, food is freshly cooked and delicious, we had the salt and pepper scallops and beef and chicken satay to start.  The scallops were far to good quality to serve in such a fashion and very good value, 7 large sea scallops was one portion, the satay was tasty but a little mild in flavor.  Our main dishes of chicken with cashews and house speciality Beef were very good, the house combination fried rice was excellent.  Efficiently served, water and tea readily available.  A very good experience."
"Have eaten here for almost 20 years when I come to the City.  There was a large convention in town this week and anticipated a long wait. They honored our reservations immediately (when the entire party of 8 was there) and we became part of the hustle bustle. Outstanding food and yes, the salt and pepper crab is sensational.  Only one person in our group struggled with using and licking her fingers to get every bit of that dish. Note: they do add gratuity for complete tables of 8 with a line for ""additional gratuity"".  We overlooked that and ended up double tipping. It was worth it. They were worth it!"
Come with a spirit of adventure! We could not understand the menu or the waiter because of the thick accent so we ordered everything he said by nodding.. The food was great overall except for dodgy looking bean curd and special beef plate which was so fried it could give  cholesterol poisoning  :-) the room was greasy and decor very dated as well as awkward server moments when we couldn't communicate.
"I always have a delicious meal here, lunch or dinner.  Their signature dish: Salt and Pepper Crab is second to none.  The soy sauce chicken is authentic and tasty -- of course they have to warn us that it has some bones and is room temperature.  Real Chinese food, a bit busy but good service, price a bit on the high side but worth it.  I make it a point to stop by at least once whenever I'm in town."
"LOVE this place... sat at the bar and had fast service.  The lettuce wraps were the perfect start to the meal.  We were SO impressed with the Salt and Pepper Crab as well as the Special Recipe Beef!  AMAZING.

Book a reservation early or online... don't leave a voicemail and expect a confirmation.  We didn't want to wait an hour to get a table but sitting at the bar was great."
The menu is quite varied and the items that I had as well as those my brother had were excellent. The one negative is that you must climb steps to get to the dining room.
I been eating at the R&G lounge many times in the last 7 years. The food is some of the best in Chinatown. The salt and pepper crab is excellent along with the house special beef. THe restaurant can get very crowed with long waits but it is well worth it.
"because we are not Chinese food experts.  I have no idea how authentic the food was.  What we had was mostly tasty.  The worst was beef and chicken on skewers.  The meat was tough.  Maybe it's supposed to be that way in ""authentic"" Chinese cooking.  Shrimp in the shells was a little messy, but we asked for it.  Otherwise we had calimari and also chopped fish, etc. in lettuce leaves.  We had a reservation for a Monday night and were seated right away although business appeared to be strong.  Our service was excellent - no complaints there.  If I went back, I would want to take a Chinese foodie with me to help me order an appropriate mix of things.  The total tab for my wife and myself was $94.40, which included a bottle of wine and tax (but before the tip)."
"Friday evening, told a 30 minute wait, but we were in under 10 minutes.  Seated upstairs, fun atmosphere.  Ordered a house specialty, loved it.  With the exception of water refills, wonderful service.  Overall, lovely experience."
"I've traveled throughout Asia for work and every time I visit Taipei, the sales team has taken me out to lunch at some great local restaurants.  They always make sure and order scallion cakes and this fantastic crunch prawn dish.  I've been to many different ""authentic"" chinese restaurants in the US and they never have any of the dishes that you get in Taiwan or Mainland China (unless you know chinese and can order off the menu in Mandarin).  R&G is the first place that I've been where you can get the real thing, including my crispy prawn dish (#208 - Prawns and Honey Walnuts).  The avocado and salmon spring rolls are great as well.  I didn't try the peppered crab but all of the local Chinese patrons were eating it so I would have to assume that it is worth getting."
"The name of the restaurant is very misleading but this is totally an authentic Chinese eatery. Booking is essential or one can be kept waiting for 45min to 1 hour on a Sunday evening. We were seated at the basement which was noisy but not unbearable. We were recommended 'rock- hound fish' which is not common but it's very much a home-made Cantonese dish, served as soup first and then fish fillet. The soup was very good, clear and fresh. Their signature dish was chilly pepper crab which was excellent. One will see this on every table in the restaurnt. Disappointing was the Boston lobster prepared In ginger sauce without much taste of the ocean.  It was also oily. The fried clams were of medium size and again was also too oily as were the vegetables  with tofu. The sauces on these dishes seemed too thick. The chicken prepared in soy sauce, a signature dish, lacked the proper appearance of this classic dish with the soy sauce being too pale in colour. Lacking in a proper  was compensated in flavor. Overall, the price is quite reasonable, about $40/person with this type of menu."
Had one of the best meals here!  The Mushu Veg is outstanding!   The restaurant also had excellent wines at reasonable prices.
"Called in whilst following the ""SF in one day"" Trip Advisor itinerary.  We had the Hot & Sour Soup, R & G Special Beef & Honey Ribs.  All lived up to the other great reviews and it was fortunate we still had plenty of walking to do to work it off."
"Great food everytime!  Fast service.  Well and worth the money.   Special beef, salt and pepper crab and calamari are a must!  Servers could be better.  Only downfall of the place. Love, love, love!"
"My husband and I visited the RG Lounge after watching Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations San Francisco episode.  We went on a Saturday night and  place was packed!  Even though we had reservations, we waited :30 for a table.  When we finally sat, we had a lychee martini (kinda gross but everyone was drinking them!), salt & pepper crab, won ton soups and chicken with cashews.  The best part of the meal was the salt & pepper crab -- somewhat steep though priced at $42.   While the food was good, the service was not.    The host was very rude.   It also felt like the waiters were constantly  trying to up-sell us, persuading us to ordering more food and dishes we did not care for or want! Not sure if the crab was worth the crabby staff!"
Very good food and service. Very busy (we waited 30 minutes for a table with no reservation) and mostly oriental clientel which we consider a good sign.
We had dinner here our last night in town. It was recommended by a local. It turned out to be a good place with very good food. Very busy though. As we were leaving there appeared to be about 20 people waiting. This place was full of locals and tourists alike. The earlier you go the better as it filled up quite rapidly.
"Upon entering, you are told to go upstairs or downstairs depending on where they have a table open.  As soon as we sat down, someone IMMEDIATELY brought us purse hangers.  That, to me, was a very kind and welcoming offer of great service.  We didn't have to ask.  They were brought to us to use without hesitation.  The food choices were different to us as we are used to traditional American Chinese items to choose from.  We were far from disappointed.  While the dishes were brought out to the table as they were ready causing some of our party waiting for their dishes, this did not, in any way, disappoint us as the food was phenominal.  Between the four of us, we ended up sharing all of our dishes with each other.  All of it was too good NOT to share.  It appears the staff works as a team.  I still don't know who was our server.  All of them worked very well together.  We only wished we lived closer to this gem."
"We visited this restaurant for lunch. The Kung Pao shrimp were very good but the highlight for the table was the seafood clay pot which came brimming with shrimp, huge scallops and squid. The roast duck is also very good. This is not an ""upscale"" spot but the food is good & service is quick.  Price wise this is one of the better cheaper places around. The place is always full so you know he food is fresh. For dinner be prepared for a lineup at he door."
"We made a reservation for 6 pm on Tuesday night for a party of 8.  When all of us arrived, we still have to wait at least 15 minues for the table.  We order, the waiter will suggest more than one portion of each dish ordered which is too much for all of us.  The food tasted OK. The roast duck was the best dish we had.  At the end, since they needed a table for the next customer, the waiter told us to leave, although politely, after we paid."
"Recommended to us by local shop keeper in Chinatown, our having struck up a conversation with them and asking what they thought of Bund Shanghai or Hunan Home as we were aboutbto try one, working on Trip Advisor recommendations here. The local described both as 'average' and suggested R&G as the place they always use. Glad they did.
First class food
Good service
Great value for money
As always, if the locals eat in a place it invariably turns out to be good.
This place had a mixed clientele of locals. (Incl Chinese), business people and I guess visitors like ourselves.
We sat downstairs which doesn't look much but the food and service are great.
Make this your go to for Chinese in China tow"
"We went twice in two days after an hotel recommendation.  Lovely food, good service and a fun atmosphere.  Only problem is that we fear we will be disappointed at any other Chinese restaurant.  Great place."
"Wow.  Who would think the best fried oysters I would ever eat would be in Chinatown ?   Amazing food.  Sea bass, Peking duck and the BEST veggie fried rice.  Not great at all.  A MUST."

"This is the best Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, & my Chinese friends always agree! Even the nearby hotels recommend it."
"We went with a group to R&G Lounge last week. This is the 3rd time I've been here in 5 years & it has never disappointed. There was a wait & even with reservations they didn't seat us on time, but the service is quick & expedient. 
I finally tried the S&P crab & it was... fine. Certainly not worth $40 or $45 but ok. We also had chow mein, kung pao chicken, pork ribs & all were very good. We started with the salmon/avocado rolls, which were excellent.
If you're craving traditional, delicious Chinese - this is one of your best bets!"
"My husband and I are from Liverpool in the UK where there is a large Chinatown we are used to good chinese food.  We were told that Michelle Obama had eaten there earlier in the year so figured it would be good and it didn't disappoint.  The restaurant was extremely busy and the service wasn't the best we've ever had but the food made up for that. Between us we had hot and sour soup, mongolian beef and mu shoo vegetables all of which were excellent."
"First, my wife and I were shopping in Chinatown and asked a shop owner for a recommendation.  Her question to us was, ""do you want good or really good?""  We said, ""really good.""  Her recommendation was R&G Lounge and it was spot on.  When we arrived, the place was packed.  It appeared that the folks waiting were primarily locals and there was a 30 minute wait--all good signs in my mind.  After our wait we were directed to go downstairs, which I must admit was not exactly impressive...very hectic and loud; however, we were there for the food.  We ordered the garlic eggplant, kung pao chicken and hot and sour soup--all were delicious.  My wife doesn't particularly like eggplant, but her favorite part of the meal was that delectable dish.  If you want great food and not terribly concerned about ambiance--EXCELLENT choice."
"Pros

- Salt n' Pepper crab did not disappoint. Outside was flaky, savory with a small kick from seemingly white pepper as well. Very similar to a Taiwanese night market fried coating
- HUGE portion so $40 for a crab can easily (and did easily) feed two guys
- Not as noisy as would be expected for such a popular place. The restaurant is in the basement and the ambience (at 4:30 pm on a Tuesday so before dinner rush hour) was pretty enjoyable.

Cons

- Other dishes were overpriced. We had the winter melon w/ slow roasted beef. It was definitely the soul/comfort food our families cooked, but not worth $18 for these types of ingredients"
"We ate family style and ordered, egg rolls, bbq pork, chicken chow mein hong kong style, mixed lo mein, mongolian beef, fried beef and szecheun pork.  All of the food we ate was fantastic!"
"Came to San Francisco for my birthday.  Kept googling ""best peking duck in San Francisco"" and R & G Lounge kept coming up.....I looked at the menu online and saw it was near our hotel, and decided to take a chance.  Called and told them i needed a reservation at 730pm on a saturday night.  We walked over from the hotel and when we turned the corner we were amazed!  The crowd was spilled out of the restaurant onto the sidewalk.  All I could hear was Chinese being spoken.  The poor frazzled girl at the front desk kept telling walk up customers it would be at least an hour before they would be seated.  She took my name and told me to stand by.  After about a five minute wait we were seated....Thank goodnes we had made a RESERVATION!!....I would NOT try to go here without one.  Our Server Edward was prompt, polite and helpful.  We split peking duck, seafood fried rice, and mixed vegetables.  The duck was INCREDIBLE!!....SO tender and moist and juicy!!!.....(I personally prefer the english version where they shred the duck so you dont get bones, but they were easy enough here to get off and dispose of)....and the skin!!!.....I have NEVER had that crispy of a skin on a duck....ANYWHERE!.......The seafood fried rice was a mixture of shrimp and imitation crabmeat and was so LIGHT and FLUFFY......some places you go you get hard little bits of something called rice that tastes like soy sauce......not here!  The vegetables were fresh and sauteed to perfection in a really nice sauce.....We decided NOT to be pigs and order the salt and pepper crab.....then later heard from a fellow diner we should have splurged and gotten it.   Easily one of the BEST birthday dinners I have ever had.   Thanks R & G Lounge !!!!!.....Can't wait until my next trip to San Francisco!!"
Started with great signature martini of the house.  Dinner was beef with special sauce and the scallops and steak.  The latter was tremendous.  Service was exceptionally attentive and friendly.
We loved eating at this exciting and moderately priced Chinese Restaurant.  The food was exceptional.
"So good. So reliable. 

We were first here 8 years ago and wanted to go again on our trip north this year but couldn't recall the name or the exact location. Hungry and tired, we traced our steps from recollection and finally stumbled onto the place we remembered! Hooray! We were shown to the same table; perhaps we had the same waiter. We ordered exactly the same meal. 

I suspect that the price was not exactly the same as 8 years ago, but no matter. This is my favorite place on earth for Peking duck and it does not need to be ordered in advance. The pancakes that come with the duck are out of this world. The plum sauce is so intense and complex. I can only hope I will get back to R and G before another 8 year interval."
"My family has had special occasion Chinese meals here for several years, whenever my mother was visiting SF.  I have managed to miss 3 or 4 meals here so my special request this trip was to have dinner here.  Because we had 16 people, we got a private room.  The dungeness crab 3 ways (black bean; garlic and green onions; deep fried with salt), black cod (seared and glazed), scallops, shrimps, roasted chicken, pea shoots, gai long (chinese broccoli), tofu stuffed with shrimp, chow main were all delicious and tasty. I would definitely go back with a group...you just can't try enough things with just a few people."
"The roast duck served at R&G Lounge was delicious!  Traditional bread and sauce served on the side, it made for an amazing lunchtime experience for our first trip to Chinatown.  The downstairs dining room is a little small, but the whole place is very clean and neat.  Service was great!"
"We had reservation so waiting time wasn't bad & we seated in the basement. Well, we were there for the food, not the ambiance. The service is okay, rushed little bit but I see that is common in the busy chinese restaurants. The salt & pepper crab was delicious, the stuffed beancurd also great. We also ordered seafood claypot which was also very good, and chicken chow mien for the kids. Definitely will come back to R& G."
The restaurant was recommended by staff at our hotel and the food was excellent.  The restaurant is very popular and because we didnt book we had to wait for a table but it was worth it
"No matter what style, salt & pepper, ginger & green onion, steamed..........they offered
the best in town. Also, their steamed fish is alway done right.
Please do not hesitate to try Cantonese style Chinese food here."

"Wasn't really planning on having Chinese food while visiting San Fran but due to extenuating circumstances, we had little choice.  After reading the reviews we decided to check out R & G Lounge.  When we arrived the place was jam packed and i took note that 85% of the customers waiting for a table were Asian.  To me, this was a very good sign.  We were a fairly large party of 8....oh wait before i go on, THEY DON'T take reservations some other reviewers say to make ressies but you can't.....to continue, since we were a large party we thought it may take a while to get in but we only had to wait 10 minutes.  We sat down and ordered the chicken and beef satay for the table.  Was ok, nothing special but the meat was crispy fried.  My wife doesn't eat fried food so the Satay was a bit of a disappointment since most satay isn't fried.  We all ordered a wide variety of food for dinner and almost everyone had excellent Chinese food.  There was one dish that wasn't very good, but maybe that's just because it was what it was ""eggplant and salted fish"" in clay pot.  So besides that one dish the rest was really good.  I saw a lot of people ordering the "" salted crab"" that everyone raves about.  Looked awesome, but it's also fried so i couldn't get that with the wife.  But for $42 bucks it was something i would have liked to share with the table more than have for a dinner.  

Service was a bit crazy and scattered.  Food did come out one by one and slow, just as other reviewers noted.  They forgot the clay pot order but were quick to get it out.  If you ask for water, expect it to arrive after you finish your dinner.  The bathrooms are all unisex and both i went into were NASTY, i mean NASTY.  So  if you're a woman make note, i'm a guy and i'm saying it was gross.  

All and all it was great Chinese food.  Don't go here if you're expecting fine dining, but if you're looking for really good chinese i don't think you'll be disappointed."
"We planned on lunch here. Went in and asked to see a menu. A couple coming in after us, apparently known to the hostess, asked to be seated upstairs and were immediately taken there. We then asked to be seated upstairs and she said, ""Only big tables. You must sit downstairs."" We were taken into a crowded room with all the windows covered. Asked again to go upstairs. ""No! You will sit here!"" we were told. We left!"
Ate here for a quick meal before dinner. Had fried oysters and the lobster meal. Pretty good you can tell the oysters are fresh not fishy. The lobster was good as well the sauce that the lobster was covered in was very good some king of butter garlic. It wasn't too filling which was prefect for us. Would recommend.
"Whenever I'm in town, this is a must place to go. Had a 7:30 reservation on a Sat., and waited for 15 to 20 min.  I made a reservation 2 weeks ahead, and highly recommend it, or you will have to  wait.
    Of course, I had the amazing salt & pepper crab. It was very sweet and crispy. They gave us crab crackers, but not necessary, because the shells were soft enough to crack with our teeth. Will travel for the crab! We also had the meaty oysters with ginger/onions, and the seafood combination clay pot. Both were perfectly prepared. Very generous! I also had the R&G special beef, which was just o.k. It was lacking flavor for me. Do make sure you get a bowl of white rice. Had a lot of rice all over the world, but this is the best. It's shiny, fluffy and full of flavor.
     This place is so good that I returned the next day for lunch. I got the seafood clay pot again and the stuff tofu. Great!
      My servers on both days were friendly and attentive. Always smiling. Little pricey, but so worth it. Best authentic Chinese restaurant ever! They can validate for 2 hours at the Portsmouth garage. It was a15-20 min. walk from the hyatt at the Embarcadero."
"My friend and I had lunch at R&G Lounge for the first time and the menu had a number of reasonably priced lunch entrees.  The service was very efficient and we had piping hot chow mein, chow fun(rice noodles) and pork wonton soup.  The lunch menu is different from the dinner menu, so if you want their signature crab dish(cooked several different ways), it's only available for dinner.  To celebrate a birthday, we had the baked lobster with supreme broth and garlic available at dinner only.  The food is cooked in the Chinese traditions - pure broths, steamed casseroles, live fish cooked several ways, roasted/BBQ poultry as well as the traditional Chinese restaurant methodologies of stir-fry and fried.  Typically, Chinese food is served steaming hot so will not arrive all at once.  If you go for dinner, I would suggest reservations as there is a considerable wait after 6 pm.  For lunch, arrive about 11:45 am so you don't have to wait for a decent table."
"I was here two years ago during dinner time and it was packed with people and the restaurant made outstanding Chinese food.  Two years later on August 6th, the food was average and during a not so busy time.  I was disappointed and a bit embarrassed because I kept on raving to my boyfriend how good the food was at this restaurant.  I will not be eating at this restaurant my next visit to San Francisco."
"Get a reservation because this places gets packed! We had great service (although our food didn't come all at once). Everything everyone ordered was sooooo good. If you want some legit Chinese food in Chinatown, this is your place."
"Funky little Chinese restaurant right across the street from the Hilton in China Town...the name would make one think of this as a bar - and there is a nice one upstairs - but this place is recommended for it's food!  (Last time I was there I tried to order a Long Island Iced Tea and they weren't quite sure what that was if that helps clarify!!)

I've eaten here several times now and had everything from the standard Pepper Steak to the Salt and Pepper Fried Dungeness Crab...each meal has been wonderful and I make a point of stopping here to eat when I'm in San Fran...it's definitely worth the wait for a table!"
"My family and I were reccomended this restaurant by the concierge in our hotel as the 'best Chinese restaurant in the city'. We waited over one hour for a table and when we finally sat down and ordered,  the service was very haphazard.  We waited a long time for the first dish to arrive and then the other dishes were delivered with a wait of around 15 minutes between each one.  So by the time they all arrived, most of the food was cold. We also had to remind the waiter to bring our drinks. When we complained, the manager offered us a discount but it was already too late. This restaurant appears to be a victim of its own success and obviously now can't cope with demand. Would go somewhere less popular and more officiant next time. Not reccomended at all."
"We had read great reviews, the place is OK, food is not great, but not bad, the restaurant seems a bit chaotic. Was not impressed, but was not a bad experience."
"We had heard a lot of good things about r n g so we caught the bus from pier 39 through china town and checked it out. Holy Crap the bus was packed with asian people coming and going... Wow- Anyway, It was a busy place, but it was cool in a 70s retro way. When we walked in it was going to be about 1/2 hour wait, but a spot opened up at the bar so we slid right in. We ordered the salt n pepper crab and it was AMAZING! Expensive, but really really good. We also had ""special beef"" which was delicious but the portion was not impressive.

If you get a chance, hit the R n G Lounge and have a cocktail or stay for dinner, it is worth the trip."
"Forget the decoration, try to get a seat in the main dining room. The Duck is excellent, the crab is the house specialty, but honestly i prefered the steamed to their recommended fried one, too fat/oily and where the taste is wasted by the cooking... 
Exzellent coktails at the bar waitng for a seat, and nice funny staff... At 10 pm, they pushed us out.. and rushed the pltes, whihc is not what we were looking for, but the kitchen was good."
"We stayed in a hotel nearby this restaurant and we asked for a suggestion where to eat. It was little bit late and we didn´t want to walk too far. 
We were told about this place and we were really surprised for the service and, of course, the preparation of the dishes, The chef does a great job and the presentation of the plates has a personal touch. 
We were suggested different dishes, but the menu HAS PHOTOS! Of the dishes! So you are not going to have any problem choosing what you want to eat. Specially for people like us who don´t know much about chinese and cantonese food. 

We went three times and we were fascinated. We also had ""To Go"". 
You need to try the duck. Incredible! You won´t regret to wait. Sometimes it is crowded and you need to wait a little bit. But it is worth it.

My suggestion: try different dishes, eventhough you don´t know what you are eating. And share them with your couple or friends. It is a nice experience.

Bon appetite!"
"We went there a few weeks ago after reading the good reviews on the internet and also the concierge at our hotel (JW Marriott) recommended us this ""very good"" chinese restaurant....but what a disappointment (((( We travel a lot around the world, but never had such terrible chinses food in a filthy place (grease and dirt)."
"Mom and pop kind of Chinese place - low key, good value, fish tanks hold fresh crab and lobster.  Did not have to preorder Peking duck...and wow was it good!  Crispy skin and wonderful puffy ""buns"" to wrap it in.  Wish Ohio had anything this good."
"My mother celebrated her birthday at R&G Lounge in July and my family had a great meal. Walking to the restaurant I felt like I was in another world, even in my own town. The service is quick and gets right down to business because this place is packed! There were five of us and we ordered two Salt & Pepper crab, Five Treasures, honey spareribs, chow mein & mustard greens with mushrooms. You will love the crab here if you enjoy picking the crab yourself for the sweet meat inside the shell. We are very lucky to get crab year round on the Pacific Coast but when it is crab season in SF, it gets even better.  The five treasures was delicious because I love eggplant, sweet peppers and shrimp and the sauce was very flavorful. I highly recommend this dish as a side to go with your crab meal. The chow mein was just ok. There is validated parking nearby. Make reservations to avoid the long wait."
"This is a must do in Chinatown, great experience. Make reservations or go early, the place is ALWAYS crowded. Don't expect much from the servers in terms of answering questions from the menu, it is what it is and they have pictures that help. The food is great and prices were reasonable. Try the Mai Thai!"
"We had seen the R&G Lounge on a bus tour of the city and wanted to make this a stop during our visit - what a great place to eat at very reasonable prices.  The entire family (6 of us) ate here and all had terrific meals.  We did arrive a little early (11:30) to beat the lunch crowds  - it filled fast!

There are two levels to enter on and we ate on the lower level from the street.  I had the R&G Special Beef and it was amazing! Service was very prompt and you did not wait long for water refills, etc.  It has a great, cosomopolitan feel and is a MUST if you are in San Francisco."
"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING- I would fly to San Francisvo just to eat here again! Let's see where do I start- fried rice YES-
Salt and Pepper Crabs-  YESSSSSSSSS and Lobster- make room because it's just so fabulous you can't leave without it. Hands down one of the bestvrestaurants in the State of California!"
"Good authentic Chinese Food in downtown SF.

If you go, you must have the Crab, in any form it's very good.

It's a little expensive, but delicious. The scallop & beef would be the best if the beef was a little leaner. 

The waiters are nice.

Not the world's best, but overall grade......GOOD."
"Upon getting referred here, I was surprised to learn it has been around some decades.  It was crowded, had a great vibe, and the food was wonderful.  Salt and pepper fried crab is the thing to do, and it did not disappoint."
"My husband and I ordered too much. Our young waiter looked at us, considered a minute, and said ""too much food."" We canceled one item and he was still right.  The salt and pepper crab wreaked havoc on the tabletop and our hands and faces, but it was worth it, the best crab we've had in years.  The Peking Duck was not as outstanding, but still well worth eating.  The place was mobbed on a Thursday night, so make a reservation!"
"When we asked the front desk staff at the hotel where do you go for Chinese food and he said R & G Lounge. That is where he takes his Mum and Dad for a nice meal.
We went there about 4 pm and the place wasn't that full.  Service was good but not exemplary. Didn't have to wait long for the dishes. We had deep fried tofu as an entree, stir fried oysters, seafood with snow peas and a beef dish for mains. They were delicious. 
Of course we had Californian wine to go with this fantastic meal."
"We been here a few times, salt and pepper dungeness crab and soy sauce chicken is out of this world, the menu is typical Cantonese, the restaurant is an old establishment in Chinatown, with choice ingredients and traditional style cooking, we always come in if we are in San Francisco, enjoy the meal every time."
"Not the best chinese food in San Francisco, but I do recommend this place because of the consistency. Reservation a must, very noisy place and service is only average. Must order their signature crab dish and sticky rice stuff fried chicken, one of the best."
"We followed Anthony Bourdain's advice and went to R&G for the salt & pepper crab- it is so good! Of course, you have to know how to enjoy whole crab (eyes looking up at you and all), and know how to get down and dirty, sucking the deliciousness off each piece! Salty and garlicky and just right... and I don't even usually enjoy crab! Ours was $36 for the plate and totally worth it! We had a couple other dishes that were good but nothing to write home about. The crab is where it's at!"
"We went to this restaurant on the last night of our 3 day stay in San Francisco. The receptionist was a little indifferent to us but there was no queue and we were seated straight away in the upstairs room which was already fairly full of locals and tourists. Service was a little on the slow side but drinks were served followed by one of our several choices. Unfortunately that dish sat on the table for quite a while whilst we waited for the rest of the order to arrive which came in dribs and drabs. By the time it was all presented on a table that was too small to hold it all the first dish was cold and they forgot part of the order so we had to wait even longer for that to arrive. The food itself was horrible the noodles were soggy, the pork and duck were extremely fatty, the egg fried rice was greasy and the spare ribs were all bone and no meat. It wasn't a pleasant experience it wasn't a pleasant restaurant, dark, cold, food on the floor and very very pricey for what was served. The service left a lot to be desired they were rude, off hand and totally disinterested until it was time to pay!!!!!!. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, I was very glad to leave and I cannot understand how other trip advisor reviews rate it so highly."
"We heard this place was good through some friends, so we had planned to end up in China town around lunch time to eat. There's so many options, but I'm glad we chose this place. The food was delicious, it was clean, and the staff was friendly. My husband was disappointed that they didn't have dumplings on the menu, but overall the food was good."
"We went for lunch on Memorial Day.  We circled the block a couple of times because we could not find available street parking.  We ended up parking at the nearby parking garage where R and G Lounge offered free parking validation.  

Upon entering the establishment, we were asked to go downstairs where we were seated right away.  We were handed the menu and given complimentary tea.  We ordered the salt and pepper crab, R and G special beef ($17), and salted fish with chicken fried rice ($11).  Our bill was $68.35 minus tip (and without drinks).  

I am deducting a couple of stars because a) parking situation was difficult, b) they were disorganized in serving the food.  They brought out the crab first, then It was at least ten minutes before they served the beef, and another ten  minutes before they served the fried rice.  It was a bummer that we were almost done with the crab when the rice came.  The crab was delicious.  The beef was tender, but it was nothing special.  The fried rice was good, but they scrimped on the chicken.  Eventhough we enjoyed the crab, it's not enough to compel us to return in the near future."
"Helpful reception staff in the Mandarin Oriental recommended R&G- it's not the sort of place you'd look at and walk into. The entrance looks more like a take-away, but hides a tardis-like  upstairs and basement.  There were crowds waiting, and we were warned it would take half an hour for a table.  But after a 10 minute walk round the block we were given a table straight away by the bar, where you could watch the general buzz.  You come here for the food, not the ambiance, and the service was efficient- neither brusque  nor gushing. But wow, is the food good!   Catfish in garlic, three treasures (aubergines, chilli peppers stuffed with shrimp), peking duck with little sticky buns... and a good wine list.  The best Chinese I've had for years: flavours on a par with Singapore and Bangkok restaurants, or that elusive childhood memory of a Chinatown lunch in Liverpool in the '70s..."
"We had made a reservation (for 3) weeks in advance.  While 2 of us made it to the restaurant on time, the server refused to seat us until the entire party was on site.  Even after everybody's arrived, we waited another 1/2 hour before we were seated.  

The attitude of our server was horrible - rude, unfriendly and made belittling comments.  

The quality of the food was so-so; the salt/pepper crab was good but of the 3 dishes we ordered and all 3 dishes considered... it was only so-so.  

Overall - considering the food, the service, the wait and atmosphere... this fell short of expectation as this restaurant came highly recommended.  

This restaurant, in my opinion, was over rated."
"Ate at R&G Lounge our first day in San Francisco for lunch.  The food was very good, but it was far too pricy for a lunch.  Also, there are no windows, so the lighting is terrible.  By the time your food comes, you eat, and are ready to leave, you feel like it's midnight and just want to go to bed (the fact that you stuffed yourself will also contribute to this feeling).  You can't see when you get back outside because you feel as if you've been sitting in a cave.  You won't be disappointed in the food, but you won't like the bill when you get it!"
"Every place experiences an off-day and I'm sure that R & G is no exception.  This place came highly recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and most of the reviews we read reflected the same.  We arrived about 5:30, we didn't have reservations and were promptly seated at a table at the top of the stairs right in the midst of heavy foot traffic.  We asked to be seated elsewhere but were told that there wasn't an available table because we didn't have reservations, so be it.  We ordered the barbeque pork appetizer, rather dry but flavorful.  We also ordered the Mongolian Beef and the Chow Mein, Hong Kong style....the Mongolian Beef was bland, and when the Chow Mein finally came out, it wasn't prepared as ordered and was sent back.  We also ordered Egg Rolls and Pork Fried Rice and they were good.  Yes, the menu offers creative dishes as well as some of the old stand-by's.  And, yes, a number of celebrity chefs/food critics have eaten here and raved about the place.  Like I said, maybe we just visited here on an off-day, but for what this place costs, we expected better tasting food and certainly better service."
"We were recommended to go to the R & G (I thought it was C & G) by the owners of the Redwood Inn on Lombard street. They are Chinese themselves and  obviously knew their way around the local restaurants in China Town. 
They told us that when they had friends over, they would go to the R & G themselves.
When we got there (by taxi) the place looked very modern and also very full. We were told that there would be a 30 minute wait for a table so we got a drink and within 10 minutes were called and taken downstairs to our table. The place is like a Tardis - deceptively big, with enough seats for about 60 people easily I would say.
The customers downstairs were 80% chinese which is always a good sign I think. We didnt have the crab but many of the people in there did and it looked delicious.
We were a party of four and ordered a main course each, some rice & noodles.
Thankfully the waiter brought out the main courses one by one as we would never have eaten them all in one go.
The food was beautifully presented and tasted great. It is quite easily the best Chinese food (and us Brits eat some Chinese food!) we have ever eaten. 
I thanked the people in the Redwood for recommending it to us and in turn I would advise anyone thinking of didning in San Fran to make this place one of your 'must go to' places."
Our hotel recommended this place and we entered without wait into the main dining room - a miracle since the line spilled onto the street when we finished.   The salt n pepper crab was the best we've ever had. I have had many types of crabs all over the USA and this was the best. Service was not good it was great.   One of our best dining experiences in 2012
The Salt & Pepper Crab is absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back and eat more!!!! The service is great as well.
"Over-rated. Big $$$.  Very oily, very messy, good flavor.  I probably will never get this again.  R & G is Very busy, line is long.  If staying nearby, I suggest order take out; go downstairs & place your order.  It's much faster.  Food is good."
My family had a great lunch here while visiting San Francisco last summer. We had great service and the restaurant was packed. The concierge at the Omni recommended it and we were please!
"It was a pleasure to dine at R&G since their menu is filled with Chinese food that you do not see on every other menu in Chinatown. After many years of eating Chinese food, there are usually few surprises for me, but at least 30% of the items being offered here were new to me and I'm looking forward to trying more of them."
"This restaurant was packed last night and long lines to sit down. For me I didn't enjoy the food, but most people seemed to love it. If you like more traditional chinese, authentic this is more suited. Was a bit ""bland"" in my view, but as I say it was busy and is very popular"
"We stopped in at 3:30 for a late lunch after checking into our hotel.  No lines, but the place definitely wasn't empty, and for good reason.  Our family of four shared several dishes, including the salt & pepper crab, which was unbelievable!!!  Don't miss this place.  Fantastic food, great atmosphere, cheap beer."
"Busy restaurant with 50/50 chinese to western patrons ... A good sign , food was excellent I had barbecue pork starter and beef with scallops and macadamia nuts .... Very pleasing indeed. On a Monday night we had to wait 30 mins for a table , and was a recommendation from our bar tender in the hotel.... Very jolly."
"Most of the reviews I had read suggested the salt and pepper crab, but my 11 year old son and I weren't quite brave enough for that.  At lunch, he had the special beef and I had some honey glazed ribs.  Both were delicious, but the ribs were sure messy!  Later in the week, after striking out at a couple of restaurants we wanted to try (places closed early on Sunday), my son suggested we go back to R&G.  He had the special beef again and I had salt and pepper scallops.  We also shared some soup.  It had noodles and slices of beef; it was good, but the meat was quite fatty.  Overall, we enjoyed both experiences."
"Best Peking Duck of my life.  My husband LOVED the Salt and Pepper Crab.  This place is legit, and you will not be disappointed.  Great food, and great service.  We lucked out when a local directed us here.  A+++"
"I travelled to Chinatown and purposefully picked a restaurant that was highly rated.  The meal was extremely disappointing and the service uneven.  Very disappointed
 with the experience."
I checked in my hotel and needed a close place to get dinner. R & G Lounge was given as a recommendation. It was so crowded that I decided to grab takeout from downstairs. The young lady that took my order wasn't rude in anyway but definitely not friendly. I got my order and headed back to the hotel. I had half an order of roasted duck and it was just ok.
"We had already eaten at a well established restaurant that had great ambiance, but had seen better days and served very ""americanized"" chinese food. (I had to cut meat with a knife). We wanted more of an authentic Chinese eating experience. R&G fit the bill nicely for us. The menu was diverse and innovative. The portions were more than adequate, the food freshly prepared and some items were even a bit creative, such as the salmon and asparagas roll. Good blend of flavors. I had to wait for the beef soup but it came bubbling hot, fresh from the stove where they cooked the egg in it at the last minute. The salt and pepper calamari was not only very tasty but cooked to perfection. It was one of those restaurants where you looked forward to returning even before you got your check. Very efficient service also."
"The place was packed and they will sit patrons w reservations first unlike other Chinese restaurants that never take reservations. The food is awesome. I like the lamb in a bun the best. The steamed egg with clam is something different to try. Fried stuffed tofu is delicious. E fu noodles is just so-so and it would be better to order something else. Overall, good good and fast service."
"Went to R & G to catch up with an old friend while at a meeting in SF and we were guided to this restaurant in Chinatown where people were crammed in the waiting area and over-flowing onto the sidewalks.  This Chinatown restaurant, where many of the restaurants are now ""for tourists"" seems to still have a strongly Asian and local clientele.  The food was good and the crab special was definitely worth a visit."
"This article is in defense of the R & G  Peking Duck which was slandered by Marydan1's report from July 6 2008 and katheiann's report from New Jersey. Marydan1 complained about the ""meat in the Peking Duck."" The preparation of the bird involves hanging and marinating for twenty four hours. The meat will never be juicy and birds specially bred and fattened. This confuses me because when I have Peking Duck it is for the crispy skin and to be honest, I have never eaten the meat. As these birds are hung and marinated for long periods, the meat cannot be juicy and succulent  If Maridan1 wants roast duck, she should order the roast duck or in the boonies of Tennessee just go out and shoot one. 

Oh by the way, the chilli crab was nice too."
"Longest wait ever to be seated downstairs in a basement, food Ok but nothing to write home about. Highlight was watching the kitchen staff devour piles of seafood on the table next to us. Would not go back."
"If you don't order the Salt and Pepper Crab (market price, ours was $38 for one crab), you would have come to R&G Lounge in vain. Every other person who came into the restaurant ordered the crab.

Sometimes, I was wondering whether I was eating soft shell crab. At other times, I was thinking of whether the tea could wash all that grease in my stomach. The thing is that, it is the first time I'm eating crab cooked in such a way and it's delicious! It's not too salty and was a good complement to the fresh crab meat. However, I think it was a little too much for 2 people to share and would be perfect for 3.

Those with health issues please avoid this dish at all cost because of the deep fried goodness and the high cholesterol!

Just to relieve some of the guilt of eating such an unhealthy dish, we decided to order the Mixed Vegetables Deluxe ($14). I appreciate the fact that the sauce of the vegetables were not salty (some restaurants drench their vegetables in salty oyster sauce).

The service here is great as well. Our plates (which were full of crab shells) were changed without us asking and they served the vegetables pretty late into our meal, presumably because it ensures that the vegetables will still be warm after we are done with the crabs.

While the price of this place is more expensive than other restaurants in Chinatown, I think it's pretty worth it if you love to eat crab cooked in different ways!"
"love the seafood there, it would be great if the place is larger"
"We tried this Chinese restaurant on the advice of our hotel conceirge. I have to say we were disappointed. The restaurant was very busy so obviously is popular but it just didn't compare to what we are used to at home. The Chinese food we dine on at home is Peking style with lots of flavour and spices. The food we tried here was very bland. The claypot seafood dish was extremely disappointing with little flavor and very tough squid. My husband said their 'special sauce' beef dish reminded him of beef jerky. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items but I honestly couldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone used to Peking style food. On the positive side, the restaurant was clean."
"Walked to China town from Pickwick Hotel asked were a good restaurant was and were told about R & G. We were greeted by a very friendly person who made suggestions on what was good. The flavour was very good and the portions were large, had trouble finishing and the prices were reasonable."
R & G was recommended by a friend who raved about his experience a number of years ago and it didn't disappoint!  Awesome food and atmosphere!  Highly recommend for a great Chinese meal
We went because of Anthony Bourdain.  My husband wanted the salt & pepper crab.  It came before the soup -they said it some times appitizer - wrong! The soup then showed up.  I waited another 15 minutes for my clams and then 5 more for the eggplant!  Maybe before they were on TV service was better.  Husband loved the s&p crab the rest of the food -okay.  Won't recommend & won't be back.
The location is great for my regular trips to SFO.  Love the prawns and eggs.
"Skip the crab. Personally, I think it's a bit overpriced and dry.

Do go for their soups, special beef, honey walnut prawns, bean curd, and peking duck with bao bread.

They have a bar, too. Highly recommend the lychee martini."
"First, very close to Hilton Financial District (maybe a block from the door) and not too far from the offices in the district.  When I walked in at lunch, I was asked if I wanted to share a table (which means with other random diners), and I was fine with that.  My co-worker and I ate with 6 other diners in a semi-private room upstairs.  Service was minimal:  seated, given menus, tea, took order, brought food, brought check.  In all fairness I wasn't expecting much so this suited me fine.  Co-worked said it was the best duck he ever had.  I had a fried rice, which was good, and had just a little ""kick"" to it, more than I've ever had with that dish.  I also tried the salmon and avocado eggrolls, which were good, but not that special.  One of the other diners ordered the salt and pepper crab, which was huge, and they seemed to heartily enjoy it."
"We found this gem of a restaurant after we could not find the place we had reserved at and were walking around at 9 pm looking for food. People waiting outside is always a good sign, so we put our name on the list and ordered a drink at the bar. Within 15 minutes we had a table. Food is very good and there is something for everyone (also vegetarian). If you love good Chinese food, than this is a good choice!"
"Came here because we heard the crab was great, and true to their reputation the crab we ordered was excellent!  Finger-licking good!  Everything else we ordered was average for a Chinese restaurant, nothing spetacular but servicable.  Staff accommodated our baby in stroller with a corner table and service was better than average, for a Chinese restaurant.  They validated our parking so it would be free to park in the garage across street.  Though I wish they have an elevator to their second floor so people with stroller or wheelchair can have easy access."
"Salt and pepper crab, special beef and the mushroom plate. I could eat here every single day."
Had a great time at R & B Lounge. Our friends took us here and the food was very good. Salt and pepper crab is a must. Didn't like seeing shark fin soup on the menu though! The moo shu pork was good. The shrimp and candied pecan (maybe it was walnut) was fantastic. I recommend this place.
"We decided to make R & G Lounge our first lunch in San Francisco after seeing it on TV (Anthony Bourdain's ""No Reservations) and reading the many reviews on trip advisor.  I was initially surprised at how small it was and it's nondescript location.  We walked in at 1 pm and were immediately greeted and seated.  The wait staff was prompt and courteous and eager to help explain the menu.  I ordered the salt and pepper crab (it's what anthony bourdain ordered on the tv show) and was blow away by the flavor.I washed the meal down with a delicious Tsingtao beerIt was such a treat.  A bit pricey, but well worth it in my opinion.  It was a perfect meal for a long day of walking china town and visiting San Francisco landmarks.  Not to filling, but not to light.  My wife ordered some kind of chicken dish and she had no complaints.  All the food passing by looked and smelled amazing.  All in all, a good experience."
The fried crab and the special beef were excellent!
"It had to be by far the worst Chinese food I have ever had. The restaurant did not look that sanitary and we got stuck right next to the kitchen. The smells that waffed out of there was horrendous. My dish, Monogolian Beef was a big mistake. My husband made them take it back and take it off our bill. Won't be going there any time soon."
I'm not sure why this place is given so much attention.  A lot of tourists are directed to this place and I think it is really overrated.  Their crab is one of their specialties and I thought is was just greasy.  The service is mediocre at best.  I haven't gone back and don't plan to.
"The weather was bad . After a good day at the SF Palace of Fine Arts Exploratarium we decided to do some quick shopping so we ventured out to Westfield shopping centre . Had fun shopping in to early dinner so we requested a suggestion from our sales quy. Apparently the taxis are not as easy to flag down as NYC but we eventually got one but to my utter surprise it took me ten minutes to get  a few blocks away . Apparently there are a lot of one way streets. LOL ! 
Got in tens minutes late but had to wait 35 mins to be seated . Service was rushed and unattentive . I was literally bullied into ordering on suggestion from waitress. Food came quickly and  we felt pressured from the gloomy setting and rushed service and persistent flow of the clientele to eat quickly and leave !  Has had better tasting Chinese food without the hype and fast pace. Certainly did not meet my requirement of upscale Chinese dining in SFO as requested !"
"Had the Salt & Pepper Crab, Dad had the stir fried oysters and they were huge.  Food was very tasty.  Asked a guy coming out of the resteraunt when we were walking in if it was good and he looked me squarely in the eye and said best chinese food in San Francisco.  Although I don't have much to compare, he might be right!"
"When we got into San Francisco from Houston around 4 PM, we hadn't had any lunch and we wanted to try this place because we had heard good things from a friend.  It was definitely worth the trip.  There were a lot of people there even though it was only 5 PM, and their specialty dish has got to be the Salt & Pepper Crab.  All the Asians who were there was eating that.  There were also a lot of Americans but they got the more traditional fare.  Should have gotten the crab too,  but we were planning to have that at Fisherman's Wharf.  Instead we got some stir-fry and clay pot.  Both were delicious, but being that we're from Houston, we didn't think it beat out anything we could have had from Houston.  Also, the price here is just so much more expensive than in  Houston, but that's just the price of living in SF."
"if you like Chinese food, you have to go to China town while you are in San Fran and eat here. nothing we ordered was a regret."
Visit every time we come to San Francisco.   Extremely good - the salt and pepper crab is the best!  Lots of locals and that is always a good sign.
"This place was recommended to us by shopkeepers in Chinatown. It was extremely busy but well worth the wait for a table.  Very interesting dishes, as well as a few dependable ones. It appeared to be a favorite of the locals. The portions were large, the service was prompt, and the dishes we tried were beyond our expectations."
One of Chinatown's best restaurants! Authentic Chinese cuisine without all the pseudo Chinese Food cliche's commonly found in American Chinese Restaurants. This is the real deal!
"We dined with Tony & Joan Leung, and Brian & Kelly Leung. It was astounding. Tony speaks fluently, ordering everything. They roll out big plywood circles to place on their regular tables for Saturday night. Then the food comes out, huge Dungeness Crab fried in the shell, braised fish, shrimp, beer, Peking Duck (or is it now Beijing Duck, don't care, it's awesome) and my eyes were just popping. It's fast, and oh, so good. Tony always does this, and beautifully! We ate until we were ready to explode, then we headed off for dessert and drinks at the Hilton just up the street. An amazing experience! The dining room"
This place was packed on a Tuesday night.  The specials are amazing and the menu has everything & then some for all tastes.  High quality food with great presentation....
"We loved the food. My picky 10 year old couldn't stop eating all the different foods we had chosen. The beef, lemon chicken, cashew chicken, chow mein...all were delicious. We were served quickly and all plates were hot.  It is hard to please all 4 of us each with a different taste and I am a vegetarian.  Great service, reasonable prices.  Perfect"
"The R& G Lounge has been a favoruite since we lived in SF in the mid 1990's.  Upstairs and downstairs.  Theoretically locals dine downstairs.  Not atmospheric but the food is incredible!  We visited for lunch on a Monday - Soup is $ 2.00, lunch entree was $ 7.00.  Tea is included.  Sounds like regular chinese restaurant pricing, but the Michelin notices in the window (several) indicate their food is at a higher standard.  The hot and sour soup was great - my eyes watered!  The special beef was a good choice (I asked folr a recommendation.)  Looked like saavy business owners and chinese residents filling the tables around us.  Menu in English and Chinese.  Would certainly go back."
"Very fresh, and beautifully made. A little pricey, but worth it! Yum, yum!"
"We arrived around 8 PM on a Saturday evening to a 20 minute wait.  It was busy and crowded.  I was a little surprised to see the hostess ask tables to leave so she could seat new tables.  I see both sides to that debate.  We were seated and the service was quick. I had an apple martini that was really good.  We had vegetable rolls to start, they were good until I found a random piece of plastic in it.  We let one of the employees know and he was quick to apologize and take it off the bill, plus he offered us another round of drinks.  Then my husbands Kung pao arrived with no rice.  We both thought it was good, the chicken was cooked well.  A out half way through his dish my cashew chicken arrived.  While I appreciate the food coming out while it is hot, it would have been nice to get our entrees at the same time.  My dish was good.  Well, unfortunately we had a visitor at our table just as we were finishing our meal.  A cockroach crawled up the wall and onto our table.  My husband killed it and we told the server. He was apologetic and embarrassed.  He offered us free desert, which we declined because we just wanted to leave."
"Quite pricey but worth a visit. Salt and pepper crab was well-prepared. Felt very rushed, like eating at a fast food outlet and service staff seemed hurried. Liked the pigeon too."
"Dined last night with several co-workers. The service was good through the meal. The food was served hot but not all at the same time. While waiting for our checks they began to break down our table and open up the room to another party. 

Bottom line: Decent food, good service, but don't expect to linger."
"I've been going here for 30 years with my family and friends; you can always count on good food!  This is my #1 recommendation for SF. 

After you eat take a stroll through China Town for traditioanl chinese dessert or taxi to North Beach!

It's pricey, but good!"
"R&G has traditionally been one of my ""go to"" places for excellent, often unique, Chinese food.  My last two lunch-time visits have been disappointing.  Brusque service, and nothing-special food.  Maybe they don't pay as much attention to lunch patrons as they do in the evening?"
"We discovered this spot in 2011, and found our way back last night. It was a great (albeit very steep) walk from our hotel on Nob Hill, and we were hungry! Timing was perfect at 8ish on Saturday night ... very brief wait tho the house was full. We started with justright hot sour soup and lovely spring rolls. Great start, with the best lychee martinis we have had in a long time. Atmosphere was busy, fun, spirited but still very nice. Clean, whit tablecloth Chinese, with remarkable service by a team. Our main dishes were the signature salt and pepper crab, and three treasures with black bean sauce. Both were good ... the crab extraordinary and fun. They do charge for rice. And the bill adds up quickly, but it's a great night out. If you have the opportunity to join a community table, dont hesitate. We have met some neat people and the restaurant handles the ordering and individual billing fflawlessly. Oh ... and it was hands down our best fortune cookie EVER!"
"Had some local Detroit friends recommend this restaurant since they also have a place in downtown SF and told us this is the best Chinese restaurant.  Didn't have too much of a problem making a reservation for our group of 7, though it was a Wednesday night, and we did have the concierge at the Ritz calling for us.  The place is very unassuming from the street, but once we walked in, we knew we'd found a gem.  Obviously was full of local families--there was one group there for a birthday, and being in Chinatown, this is the experience we wanted.  

Lots of traditional Asian beer available, plenty of sake.  We all tried different soup, and they do have sharkfin soup available if you don't feel bad about slaughtering a huge animal just for one tiny part of its body.  The seafood soup was not very good though.

The dishes we ordered were all very good, it was pretty much like being in an authentic PF Chang's food-wise.  There was a beer with macadamia nut dish that was great.  We did get their specialty, the salt and pepper crab, which was basically a deep fried whole crab.  Kind of messy, very salty & greasy--I still prefer my crab boiled.

Some reviewers commented on the servers seeming ""pushy.""  I think it's more of a cultural difference than them actually being pushy.  Our food came out in fairly random waves throughout the meal, but I'd prefer that to having the food sit under heating lamps.  

I would highly recommend R & G for those looking for a slightly more high-end Chinatown Chinese food experience."
"This was probably the best part of our trip to china town, we were originally supposed to go to Hong Kong Clay pot but they were closed, so we were able to find some free wifi and found R&G Lounge on google. The wait was not that bad, but the place was super busy, the menu had a lot of options and the prices were good! Service was very prompt and we had tea with in minutes of sitting down"
"You have to ignore the service if you decide to eat there, because this is not what R & G can offer. Every employee there seems incredibly impatient.  We ordered Salt & Pepper Crab, Eggplant Tofu stuffed with shrimp meat and topped with special sauce and Baby Bok Choy with Chinese Mushrooms. The dishes were not bad. However, they were a little salty for me. I don't usually eat rice with my meal, but it was hard not to have something to neutralize the saltiness."
Best Chinese dumplings and peking duck. I think this rest was visited by Anthony burdain
"I've tried quite a few chinese restaurants these couple of days and this one probably tops them all in terms of decor, ambience, service and food. This is 1 of the larger places with 3 levels, and still you need a reservation to get in before 8pm. I'm not sure if they recently renovated the place, but the place looks newish with pretty decent decor. I noticed only the maitre'd is female and the rest are all male waiting staff, all seeming to know what they are doing and professional. We ordered the winter melon soup, which was tasty and I immediately knew the chefs knew what they were doing also. We had the steamed garoupa which was nicely done, and steamed fish is 1 of the most difficult dishes to do. We also ordered the beef with melon in claypot and it was very good - the beef was very tender and nicely seasoned. The last dish of stir fried vegetables was average. I'm surprised this place is not rated higher"
"I had the benefit of being taken here by Chinese friend so the experience may not be typical.  I had tried previously to eat here but could not get a reservation. 
The restaurant has three levels - upstairs for the white folks and high rollers who want high price alcohol with their meals, downstairs for predominantly Chinese families and street level for somewhere in between. Note that the street level is accessible in wheelchair from a taxi dropping off. We sat downstairs and has Chinese tea but no alcohol. 
Service was profunctory and the dishes came in a relatively uncontrolled sequence but this was not a problem. Highlights were deep friend crab, fried eggplant and chillies, honey shrimps with wall nuts and Mongolian beef. They do a series of classic varieties on Ling fish, although we did not try this. 

Notes for seating: martininis upstairs, families and faster service downstairs. Problem is that its usually full and therefore you may not have a choice unless you reserve ahead."
"Was highly reccomended by people we met.  We have had better Chinese food in Houston, TX.  Was really expecting great Chinese food but was dissapointed.  We were constantly rushed, had just order our drinks and a starter the told we should order our main course now..  
Our waiter NEVER checked with us again after we were served.  I had to get up and get our own condiments.  I was asked if I wanted another glass of wine and said yes.  Never received the wine but was charged for it.   Please look elsewhere."
"I've been here a few times and each time the food has been very good.  It was recommended to me as a place that the locals in Chinatown eat at and it's true.  If the locals eat there it usually is a good restaurant.  It gets crowded quick though and you may have to wait for 30-45mins+ , so if you want to go for dinner, then plan on an early dinner or you may have to wait to sit.  The food is good, but the service can be slow at times for drink refills etc."
Wanted to love this place; Anthony Bourdain did. We may have ordered wrong but what we did have was very ordinary.
"After an utterly disappointing encounter at Lam's Garden in Orlando (avoid!!!), we were glad to be hitting San Francisco Chinatown.  This time, I took the precaution of asking for recommendations from a Chinese staff of Walmart, Union Square, a Chinese fruit & veges grocer in Chinatown and a 40+ professionally dressed local Chinese lady I met walking around Chinatown.  I asked them where they would host a family dinner be it for their own nuclear or extended family and friends for a casual dinner or to host an occasion, limiting the choice to SF Chinatown.  All 3 recommended R&G Lounge and yeap, we were not disappointed.  For dinner, we dined upstairs.  We were so impressed that we returned the next day for lunch (we only had 2 nites in SF).  Service was just average - about 3 stars.  Lunch was in the basement and I noted strangers sharing tables for a quick lunch.  The place was teaming with lotsa local Chinese, in groups or solo, obviously on their lunch breaks.  We dine out a lot on Chinese food in Melbourne, trialled out a few restaurants on our travel in China rec by locals ... and the flavour of the food here is tops, v authentic and the house specialities are unique.  We had the lobster (the gravy choices are better than the dry fried versions) and a couple of the meats on the specialty menu.  Were I to open a restaurant in Melbourne when I retire, I will head hunt the chef or ask if they are interested in a franchise.  Tipping was left to the contented diners.  We found the prices reasonable by American standards."
"We went to this restaurant on New Year's Day for lunch.  We had to wait a few minutes.  It appears they favor their local chinese population, but we still didn't have to wait very long.  The portions were huge.  Consider sharing.  The staff is limited in English, so you have to be direct.  Overall it was a good experience and I would go again."
"I recently vacationed in San Francisco and was told I had to check out this place in Chinatown. I am so glad I did because this is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten! We had the seafood clay pot, and seafood Lo mien. This food is nothing like those big nasty China Buffets. This is authentic Chinese cuisine.  Make reservations though because it is a busy place"
"This is a Chinese restaurant like one finds in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Bangkok.  No Chinese lanterns, no tablecloths, no frills.  Just excellent Chinese food at excellent prices located where Chinatown meets the financial district.

It is not about charm or decor, and I consider that authentic ""atmosphere"" just fine; but not to be in any way confused with romantic or upscale.   We ate there years ago and hadn't been back in Chinatown since but recalled thinking at the time it was excellent Chinese fare, and since I remembered more or less where it was and the no-frills ugly green sign naming the place looks exactly as it did a decade ago (may not even have been painted in the interim) we spotted it immediately.   Being one-ish we had to wait a few minutes for a table for two, and within ten minutes of being shown to our upstairs table, maybe a ten had been vacated and immediately reloaded with new batches of diners, maybe half were Oriental and the other half big-noses. I'd bet many of both were regulars.  I noted two women who came in after us ordered without looking at the menu and were being served about the time our waiter returned for our order.   We were tucked out of sight of the main upstairs dining area, and when I couldn't see any waiters to flag down, I just stepped over to a room divider which had two plates with soy and chili sauces standing in wait and grabbed one.  

The shrimp in my wife's fried noodle dish were abundant and cooked to that perfect sweetness and texture that says they had to have come off the heat the very second they were done.  Tasty, authentic food, very reasonably priced.  Excellent.

I'm sure the R & G is the go-to place for Chinese for hundreds of San Franciscans, and it is for us too."
This is one amazing place. I did not find the prices to be too high and it was the best Chinese food I have ever had (and we have great Chinese food in Toronto!).
Not sure why this received such high ratings.  Decor is below par and the food is average.  The signature dish of salt and pepper crab is a whole crab fried in a salt and pepper batter - as if eating shelled crab wasn't messy enough.
"The crab, and baked Cod is the best and to die for!"
"Visited this restaurant based on the high ratings on TA for seafood in Chinatown.  The restaurant does not have much curb appeal, but we nevertheless, entered based on TA recommendations.  Our lunch wait was 40 minutes.  I noticed the lunch crowd was mostly tourists and very few Chinese (a sign that it is for tourists).  I noticed this restaurant also advertises in the local San Francisco magazine for tourists, a free publication available in our hotel room, which may also explain why its patrons are mostly tourists.  The seafood was cooked American-Cantonese style.  The portion was adequate, but presentation unimpressive.  American Cantonese food ~ yes, but authentic Cantonese seafood as compared to the restaurants in Hong Kong or Kowloon, far from it.  

This is another incidence where TA recommendations on restaurants have let us down."
"Yes, there's a line, yes, service is excellent, yes, the food is superb. Yes, the price is right. Yes, order the beef in the special XO sauce - it melts in your mouth. I believe that R&G specializes in Cantonese/Hong Kong style - so don't expect Szechuan or Hunan-style hot sauces, or brown sauce more typical of Mandarin style cooking, though they offer some."
"I really wanted to like R&G and after seeing and reading so many things on Yelp; I thought I'd give it a shot. 

We walked to the restaurant a little after 12pm on a Thursday. There was a heavy lunch crowd and we were handed a number. We weren't told how long the wait would be but I would guess it was around 15mins. 

We were asked at one point if we were willing to share a table with other guests to be seated quicker. I've never been asked this in all my years of eating our or at Asian restaurants. I declined and we were asked to continue to wait. 

We were seated upstairs.. literally, right upstairs. There were this tiny table that you could not push your chair back from that they seated us at. I guess I should've said yes to the sharing table. 

Our waiter came to bring menus and tea. And I think that was the last we ever saw him. 

At most Asian places (esp busy lunch places); they know the rule. Do everything quickly & efficiently. Take my order, bring my food hot and bring the check fast so I can pay and go back to work. 

Somehow R&G completely missed that memo for being a dominantly Chinese speaking restaurant. 

We had a total of 5+ servers (I kid you not). My order of honey walnut prawns (which was WAY overpriced at $18) came .. without rice.. without my husband's order. So it sat.. for 15 mins until the next server came and brought my husband's (cold) food. When I asked the 'new' server if I could please have my bowl of rice I had ordered, he brought me an empty bowl. 

I repeated that I had ordered rice but it had never come (nor did it seem to be). He finally brought my rice and we were able to eat. This whole process to get order to meal was roughly 45 mins. 45 MINUTES! Ridiculous!

My husband had ordered the lunch special which was 2 ""BBQ"" items and rice. His chicken and beef were both cold. That is unacceptable as they should have been served hot. 

For $38 for lunch; this was WAY too much money. We spent a total of 90 mins in this joint strictly for the fact that they neglected us for 45 minutes of it all. 

I'd like to claim it's because we were 'out of towners' but I don't think that was the case. I don't speak Chinese but I 'am' Chinese. Much better places to eat and not be treated so rudely. Skip it."
"This restaurant was good, but going all the way to San Francisco to have this as your Chinese meal? Disappointing!! It was really equivalent to ordering from a take out place in Ottawa. Previously (2007) we'd gone into China Town and picked a random restaurant that was very authentic and SOO good, and I was hoping for the same. This was too ""white""."
Went on recommendations from Tripadvisor. Was busy when we arrived and a good atmosphere. Food was bland and very disappointing I have to say. Duck was extremely fatty and lacked flavour. Kung Pao chicken (spicy) was not spicy and was probably the worst chinese meal I have eaten.
"On a recent trip to San Francisco, our hotel recommended that we go to the R&G Lounge.  We are glad that we did.  It is very kid friendly and the service was wonderful.  We did not have to wait for a table at all.  The food was some of the best that I have ever eaten.  We were all very impressed.  

Last night, we noticed that the restaurant was featured in the television show ""No Reservations"", and we can totally see why."
We came here because we were told it was the BEST in the city.  The Food was real good; the service was too fast and the atmosphere was plain.  I would not go back .....too many other places to eat.
"We headed out from the Hilton Financial District to Chinatown on our first night, but were overwhelmed by choices and nothing looked great or busy.  We walked back to the hotel and they recommended the R&G -- which is virtually across the street.  It hardly looks like a restaurant from the outside -- or by name -- but it an excellent one.  We managed to get the last open table, and had a great dinner.  We didn't know at the time that their specialty is fried dungeness crab;  we saw everyone there ordering it, and if we return we definitely will, too.  We had an excellent dinner, about $15 per entry."
"We visited this place because of other recommendations we viewed on line, We visited on a Sunday and found it uncrowded and full of local and Chinese businessmen, As for the restaurant they have an upstairs and and basement dinning area but on this day the basement was the only area open.   Now for the food review,  I had the Beef & Broccoli and we both had the  Fried rice and Won-Ton Soup and my wife had the Lemon Chicken which came with a custard type Lemon dipping sauce,  my food was So So and all I can say is I have had better Beef & Green in food courts at shopping malls,  as for my wife's Lemon chicken it was outstanding,  Now for the price, our bill for the entire meal came close to $60.00 which we thought was outrageous.  I think you can do better and find more reasonable Chinese food in San Fransisco, after all were taking about city with one of the biggest Chinese community's in the United States."
"We found this place on Yelp while walking around in Chinatown.   The restaurant was very busy but we were able to get a table for 2 in about 15 mins.  The service could have been a little better, but they were busy so we just went with it.  

The dining area was downstairs and we were seated in the back corner.  Which was perfect because it wasn't as noisy as the rest of the restaurant.  The food was pretty good.  We ordered hot and sour soup, satay skewers, mongolian beef, and veggie deluxe.  

The hot and sour soup was fantastic - just like moms!  I always order hot and sour soup in the hopes of finding a place that has a similar recipe to my mom's.  I'm bummed that it's not closer to home.  The skewers were good.  The chicken and beef looked like it was deep fried and it was covered in a gravy sauce.  Not what I expected but it had a good flavor to it.  The entrees came out at different times.  The mongolian beef wasn't automatically served with white rice.  They charge $1.50 for a bowl of white rice that should have come with the entree.  -_-  The veggie dish came out last.  That could have had more green veggies instead of bean sprouts as filler.

Overall, it was a good meal.  I would dine there again, but I would still be bitter about paying for a bowl of rice.

There's a bar area where you can get a drink while waiting for your table.  When you enter, they give you a printout (time stamped) with a number written on it.  They call out the number when the table is ready."
"Made reservations for 2 tables, agreed on the menu, and price, verbally.  When I rec'd the bill on my credit card, the price was 100.00 per table more than what was agreed upon."
"This is my 3rd time visiting this restaurant--I have always gone with Chinese colleagues who live in San Francisco, which allows for some special requests / orders.  The food is WONDERFUL!  Be open to trying new things and you won't be disappointed.  Definitely have a reservation as it gets very busy.  Even when they are packed, the service is incredibly fast.  Food is served family style, so order lots of different dishes.  They bring out the food in courses, so everything that comes out together, goes well together.  If you arent' sure what to order, I have seen the staff work with non-Chinese guests to figure out a good mix of food and most people seem happy with their food.  The deep fried crab is amazing and a must have."
"Very popular, always packed but be patient.  Service is classic busy restaurant, be ready to order, food comes when it's ready.  Tastes out of this world when delivered."
Busy Chinese restaurant!  Very tastey.   Glad we went!
"We had dinner here with some friends. What a great chinese food ! First time tried their BBQ Pork and Roasted Duck, just fell in love with those dishes. Loved their Chow Mein and Spring Roll as well. All the food had a great flavour, fresh and yummy !
The service just mediocre, and the prices were decent. Would like to try some other dishes next time. Definitely ...yes to come back to eat more !"
"Visited here as recommended by our hotel however I was disappointed.  Sat downstairs.  Ordered the ribs to start but could not eat them, although there were a pile of them they were 80 per cent fat.  Not a good start it kind of put me off from there onwards although there was nothing wrong with the spicy prawns and snow peas and vermicelli chow mein I didn't really enjoy it.  The place did not look particularly clean.  I would not return to this restaurant."
"We tried R&G Lounge based on web reviews.  It was an interesting cultural experience, but the food was nothing to write home about.  The chicken soup had an odd smell, and the Three Treasures dish was rather bland.    I'd stick with some of the more unassuming local eateries."
"My hubby and I dined here for dinner because he wanted to have Dungeness crab. This place is the home of salt and pepper fried Dungeness crab. We waited over an hour for our table. This place had a large crowd waiting for a table at the bar. R&G was the only restaurant that I saw in Chinatown that can attract lots of people coming off the streets. While waiting, the hostess was turning people away when they wanted to get a number for a table. She said that they are at overcapacity and would direct them to another Chinese restaurant. Once more and more people were seated, she would take on more people on the wait list. We finally got a table on the first floor behind the bar. We ordered their famous crab and the shrimps with candied walnuts and broccoli. Both dishes were delicious but honestly you can find these same dishes at other Chinese restaurants. Service was good here but don’t come here if you are looking for a fancy and quiet ambiance. It’s loud and great for groups, which is typical for large Chinese restaurants. This place thrives on its reputation of having the best crab dish in town. I would pass up on this place if there is a huge crowd waiting at the door."
"Recommended by locals, R&G did not disappoint.  My clients from Taiwan conversed freely with the wait staff and managed to order several outstanding dishes.  The jellyfish appetizer was delicious, as was the chicken soup.  We all drank beer, so the overall bill for the meal for 5 people was very reasonable.  We sat on the second floor, which is set for large groups.  There were a number of parties over 5 people, and the staff seemed to handle all of them well.  I had a hard time getting silverware, but it was just a minor annoyance.  Overall, very positive experience."
"Thought this would be better. Some good to excellent dishes, but overall nothing to write home about. Chairs SUPREMELY uncomfortable. Best thing? The black cod was to die for. ( I should have saved more room! )"
We read about this place in the Frommer's guide and because we always trust these guides we decided to visit the place. it's easy to get there on food from China town. It was extremely crowded when we got there (there was a party I think) and we had to wait for more than an hour but let me tell you it is definitely worth it. We were seated with other people in a big round table (as we would have to wait more time for a table for two). They welcomed us with a watermelon juice which was lovely and then the food arrived relatively fast and it was AMAZING! Absolutely enjoyed it! Would definitely recommend it!
"we heard great things about the restaurant. You head downstairs to dine. We sat next to the tanks where they keep all the live lobsters, fish and prawns. They were staring at me the whole time! We weren't daring enough to order the salt & pepper fried Crab, but the table next to ours did. It looked a little intimidating. I got the salt & pepper prawns. I wasn't sure if I was eating it correctly, but they were delicious. The servers weren't very helpful or attentive, but the food was delicious"
"But I'm telling you, go there for the salmon and avocado egg rolls. They are divine.  I also had a ginger chicken which was fine, but like I said, I don't really like Chinese food (I prefer the flavors in Thai). But a few years ago I went to R&G and got the egg rolls, so when I went back this month I had to make sure my memory was correct.  And it really was.  They are fantastic.  There is generally a wait, so plan on that when you visit."
"I have eaten at R&G on several occasions during my various trips to San Francisco.  The food is pretty good, but not great. The restaurant is very popular and there is always a crowd. Frequently you will find a waiting line, so go early if possible.  It has a tendency to be crowded during peak hours and this sometimes translates to a noisy, chaotic environment.  However, I think it has a certain energy which makes it interesting and in some ways entertaining.  The bottom line is that there are better Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but there are few which are as entertaining as R&G Lounge."
"I went to R & G back in April. We didn't know what to order but the food was still good. This time around we went with relatives who knew exactly what to order. DELISH!! Our crab was excellent as well as the soya sauce chicken, the pea shoots, the beef, the shrimp...We had 10 dishes and each one was tasty. Even the picky ones in our party loved everything."
"Went back twice during a recent trip to SF, so I definitely live the food. We were seated on the second floor both times at big tables that seated about ten people...with large lazy susans in the middle.  Gotta try their salt n pepper crab and the calamari!  The duck was also delicious!  Tried about ten dishes and they were all outstanding. Beware that the service is really abrupt and impersonal.  Gotta love it for the food and the people you go with. Very loud!"
"We were seated in the cellar of the restaurant which was really packed with guests.  The food was only average.  We got special beef and chicken with XO sauce.  The beef was better than the chicken.  The waiter warned us that the chicken was spicy but in our opinion, it was not spicy enough and did not have much flavor.  Another downside was that we had to order our rice separate as nothing was included with the meat entrees.  We shared a Chinese beer which was pretty good.  Staff was not that friendly and one waiter was quite rude to me while I was waiting for a restroom.  Atmosphere was too loud and boisterous.  I would try a different location in Chinatown on my next visit and wouldn't really recommend this place."
"Visited R and G Lounge in San francisco  and had the BEST meal.  It is in the heart of China Town and visited by locals and tourists alike. Read about it in Zagat 2011 as best Chinese. A crowd gathers in the bar area, but it is worth the wait.  Sign in and walk around Chinatown and return to a fabulous meal.  We were seated in the basement in a huge room filled with happy eaters. The freshness of every dish is amazing!  Take your time with the lengthy menu!  We had the cashew chicken and fried rice, but a favorite going to all of the tables around us was a deep fried crab dish that looked amazing!  I would have gone back every night of my trip if there weren't so many wonderful choices of food in SF!!"
"The food was fabulous, especially the salt & pepper crab. The restaurant was busy and the tables crowded. I felt that it was a loud atmosphere and that our waiter seemed very distracted. However, it's just what I would expect if I were actually in China. Definitely glad I ate here during my visit. Tip: make a reservation ahead of time!"
"Was recommended to try here by my hotel and I'm glad they did.

From the outside it doesn't look anything special and downstairs looks like a low-grade takeaway. But it's not a place to come for ambiance or the décor.

I chose the salt and pepper calamari and Mongolian beef. Both were cooked just right to retain flavours and keep some 'bite' to them.

Don't expect attentive service or even the same waiting staff but then if I wanted that, there are so many other places to choose from. I work on a simple premis - if it's good enough for the locals, it's good enough for me."
"Made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. Only had to wait about 5 minutes. Service was very good and the food excellent. Especially the Salt & Pepper shrimp.
Needed a taxi to get back to our hotel and asked the hostess if it would be a problem.
Well let me tell you all. She went above and beyond the call of duty and took us outside and flagged a taxis for us. unbelieveable.  What service"
"We read on-line reviews that recommended R&G as a wonderful find in Chinatown.  The hour-long wait wasn't bad (we didn't have reservations, it was Saturday night during Fleet Week and Columbus-Day Weekend, so we were grateful to even get in) as we were able to sit at the bar.  Unfortunately, the food was disappointing.  We ordered chicken soup, fried crab, Peking duck, and a fish-and-mushroom dish.  The soup was okay.  The crab - apparently a specialty - was a huge disappointment.  It was overcooked.  Almost all the meat was mushy.  Steamed Dungeness crab usually provides a lot of tasty, firm meat.  This poor crab was greasy on the outside and mealy on the inside.  The fish was also disappointing.  It was covered in a thin gelatin that gave it a slimy coating and swallow texture, while we were expecting a sashimi-type freshness based on the description and menu photograph.  The Peking Duck was fine, and we happened to like the bun-textured wraps.  The restaurant was packed, so it's a popular spot.  The food wasn't awful.  It just wasn't that good, and it was a little pricey.  Maybe we ordered the wrong entrees."
"While reservations were no problem, and the wait was minimal, the seating left a lot to be desired.  The tables and chairs belonged in a take out chinese place, and were old at that.  While waiting to order a roach ran across the wall next to us, and we almost left on the spot.  Fortuantely the drinks were well made, and tasty.  The service was random, with a different person for each request, as we never saw the same person with any frequency, and there were lots of gaps, like when our Mushu pork failed to appear with everything else (they had forgotten to make it).  The flavors were OK, but not special or worth returning for.  You can certainly find a better palce than this, especially in Chinatown."
"The food in this place was excellent, I had the Peking Duck my wife had some and this Duck as good as the one in New York Chinatown, service was very good and the server very helpful."
"We tried this resteraunt based on a recommendation in a travel guide for San Francisco. Boy were we dissappointed! I ordered the mongolion beef, my fiance the shrimp lo mein. His dish was four shrimp on top of a bowl of grease soaked noodles and nothing else! My dish was bland at best, it is supposed to be spicy according to thier menu. The waiter spilled hot water all over our table and never even offered to replaced the napkin we had to use to clean it up. If this is authentic Chinese, they can keep it!"
After hearing about this restaurant from a friend we checked it out. We tried the fried crab which was great but messy. Also had a Lei chi berry martini which was surprisingly good. Also the fried calamari was some of the best I've ever had.
we were a party of 4 with no reservation. we had to wait for 45'. there's a queue outside every day of the week! the food was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. Go early: they turn off the lights around 9 p.m.!
"I love this place because it is so authentic and delicious food. It's so close to the Hilton in the financial district and that is another plus when I am staying there, but even when I am at the Hilton in the Wharf it's worth the taxi for a meal here. They do take reservations and you should make them or plan to wait... it's that good. This is not a quiet, romantic dinner ... this is the pulse of China Town and it's busy, lots of chatter and feels foreign."
"a lot of eating(carbs), spicy  and  a lot of sauces (hiding minimal prots), cheap , and  specially among chinese people of SF,  impolite, rudes  and hurrying"
"Ate at R&G early one Friday evening and the food was good.  Paid with my American Express.  Even though there was a cash register nearby my table (downstairs, in the back) they disappeared for almost 15 minutes with my card.  It was ridiculous and I started getting concerned when I asked for my card/bill back and they still didn't bring it back right away.  The following afternoon, American Express calls me that there was a 4k charge at Louis Vuitton (denied) and $1k at Saks (went through).  Someone apparently MADE a fake card (how do you even do that?).  I am highly suspicious it was R&G.  I had only used this card a few times in SF (from out of town) and doubt the theft happened from using the card at Forever 21 or checking in at the hotel.  So beware if they take your card and take a long time to return.  American Express said they have had this happen before and are suspicious of R&G.... thank God it was on my American Express and not another charge card as American Express Ex is fantastic with customer service and removed the charge immediately.   R&G management might not even know this is happening?"
"Five of us arrived 8.30 with no reservation. Lady at the desk advised 20 min wait so no problem. Table offered at 8.50 order confusion then started. A number of items requested not available. Waiter advised that all dishes would be delivered together ( starters and mains). Discussion ensued and agreement that they would be delivered separately but some starters and some mains delivered over a ten min period and then all others except the rice which did not arrive till after everybody finished. Both duck dishes not edible one undercooked and the other so fat not fit for consumption. Had to argue not to pay for these. Service poor, food ok with exception of duck. Would have no intrest in returning"
"We were a bit disappointed, perhaps due to the 1 hour wait.  You must have reservations;  The service was not up to par.  Water glass was not clean.  Paid approx. $13.00 for seafood clay pot;  it was very good, but said it came with vegetables....  that was ONE mushroom.  Squid in clay pot was tough,  octopus was fine.  Husband ordered garlic noodles and scallops;  mostly noodles and very garlicky.  Neither came with rice.   Hot tea was included.  Most people ordered the fried crab legs;  couldn't get used to that idea.  When we fry food in the South,  you eat the entire thing.    We would have left starving if we paid $35 for that bit of fried crab."
"R&G Lounge was featured on Anthony Bordain’s “No Reservations” program on The Travel Channel. We based our business trip to SFO entirely on the program! We love Anthony and trust his wisdom on food-dom.
R&G Lounge and Sushi Sebo were on the list.
R&G was a nice Sunday walk through Chinatown, avoiding all the tourista trinket shops. Being from NYC, been there, done that. Leave me alone.
Sunday afternoon’s are a busy time, but we were later, around 4pm. We had heard about the crab and that was our prime directive.
Geoduck sashimi was the first delectable raw delight. Served on ice… so nice.
The live salt and pepper crab is a house specialty and we ordered that immediately! Lightly breaded and deep fried, this lasted until the next night in Carmel as long as kept it cold.  The meat/shrimp stuffed tofu was also a nice appetizer and silky and crispy.
But the best dish in the house to us was the live salt and pepper crab. Soft enough to enjoy the shell, however a small crack is all it takes to get to the luscious Dungeness crab meat. Devour straight up with no sauce and let your fingers and get dirty with it! Simple seasonings do this dish justice and we agree with Anthony on this one!
We talked about R&G for our entire week-long trip to SFO/Carmel and Yosemite. Go now, for exceptional Cantonese cuisine. Bring the family. This seems like any number of NYC Cantonese restaurants who can handle large crowds.

Chef's special beef and Peking duck were fantastic!
"I'm paying the price for dragging my family here!  First off, we are not Asian, but we have lived in Singapore, Thailand and Japan.  We've also traveled through China, so we a very familiar with ""non-Americanized"" Chinese food.
We were greeted by a very dismissive hostess.  She could careless she was employed or we were customers.  She decided to seat us on their ground level.  This area of the restaurant has no ambiance or appeal.  We asked if there was anything available upstairs and she said ""no.""  Sucking information out of her about wait time, etc seemed to be a major inconvenience for her.  We noticed people going downstairs and asked if there was more seating down there.  Her answer....""go if you want.""  
We ordered their ""famous"" salt and pepper crab and a few other dishes.  The crab was a greasy and had barely any meat in it.  In total, we would have been lucky to get 1/4 cup of meat out of it for $35.  The Chow Mein was oily and the chicken in it had a very strange texture...rubbery, yet mushy.  The lemon chicken had a better texture, but you dipped it in a gelatinous lemon slime sauce.  Nothing was fresh and light as heavy oil was the key ingredient to all dishes.
We've eaten our fair share of Pepper Crabs and Chili Crabs throughout Asia and their pile of ""famous"" grease crab was disgusting.  
The only thing that's saving them from a 1 star review is their martinis.  The Lychee and Mango were both delicious and generous."
The food was churned out with no flavour or freshness. It was almost like all the food was pre-prepared for quickness and reheated! It was warm on arrival and quickly turned cold. There is a definate interest in getting people in and out as soon as possible. If sitting upstairs near the air con be prepared to wrap up    warm. Very poor food &  very poor service.  Don't eat here !!!
My family and I are here 08-24-2011 for dinner. We had seen that they are known for their Salt and Pepper Crab and then a Special Beef. We made sure to order them both. The crab was really good! I didn't care so much for the beet..I'm pretty sure it was just the flavor of It that I didn't like. But...the rest of our food was good in general. After we went we heard you should get the Lychee Martini...so if you are reading this before you go...get it!!! If we go back to San Francisco we will eat here again for sure. It is a little pricey...but its good food.
"The hotel recommended this restaurant and the food and service were horrible.  The food was thrown at you and all they wanted to do was to turn the table over quickly.  The reservatoin that was made by the hotel was not on record at R&G and we have to wait 15 minutes.

Will never go back again and told the hotel not to recommend and they agreed."
"If you don't mind waiting without a reservation (make a reservation), I highly recommend this restaurant.  It's worth the wait!  The food is fresh, simple, and DELICIOUS!  We waited an hour because we didn't have reservations.  We didn't mind because we were on vacation.  It was worth it!  Also, the cocktails are FANTASTIC1"
"I love their rice plate take out. the duck/rice, pork/rice, spare ribs/rice, and the beef is all wonderful and under $8.00"
"This was some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten. Everything we had was full of flavor and very authentic. From their special beef to the seafood clay pot to the Peking duck, every bite was a delight. 

Unfortunately, because this place is so good, it's also extremely popular. We arrived at 7:30 on a Sunday and waited for an hour for a table. There are literally crowds of people waiting for tables. 

Another thing I found disappointing was that they served shark fin soup, a dish that's been instrumental in the rapid decline of sharks worldwide. Luckily, it appears that California is considering legislation to ban the practice.

Other than those negatives, I would heartily recommend the place."
"A business friend from Shanghai took me here for bunch on a Monday afternoon, excited to show me a SF restaurant he found that he said was ""excellent"".  

My friend is himself a gourmet and planning to open a high end restaurant in Shanghai. 

He ordered 7 dishes (over kill in terms of quantity) for the two of us and then smiled through every plate as he described what he liked about each dish.  Textures, combinations of spices, sauces and ingredients, clean-clear flavors, freshness, etc.

It was all very good to my ""simple palate"" and I did enjoy each dish as he described the characteristics he looked for in each classic recipe.

This is a ""walk down"" location that sits mostly below street level, so if stairs are a problem for you this isn't a good choice. 

The place was crowded when we were there, I saw lots of business folks (suits) having business lunches and lots of Chinese were part of the crowd (adding to the air of authenticity). Service and the kitchen seemed a little slow, but then we ordered 7 dishes and it was ""rush hour"" so all in all, it was not unexpected.

Summary: if you want to get some great, authentic Chinese food that a Shanghai gourmet would approve of, this seems to be your spot."
"R&G serves the best Cantonese food I've tasted, including several restaurants in Guangzhou (formerly Canton) that I've been to.  Crab is the house specialty and shouldn't be missed, but other dishes were also terrific. Very fresh ingredients expertly prepared.  The drawback?  Way too popular and the wait for a table, with or without a reservation, is looong.  Once seated, service is quick and efficient."
"Had heard this place was fantastic & highly recommeded. However I found the food and service to be rather average and much prefer takeout place (authentic chinese) at home. For example my cashew & chicken - very few cashews, skimpy on veggies and chicken bland & rather tasteless. 

Place was buzzing, very busy and appeared to be frequented by local Asians which is generally sign of good chinese food , unfortunately our party was rather disappointed."
This was a really awesome place for authentic Chinese food! The Kung Pao Chicken and Seafood Fried Rice were both very good!
"Just simply a great real chinese restaurant,
went with my family and everybody enjoyed themselves."
Located on the cusp of the Financial District and Chinatown is a really great Chinese restaurant. From the outside one would probably not go in but do yourself a favor if you like Chinese food.
"Right across the street from the Hilton Financial Hotel, the Rand G Lounge was recommended by the staff.   We were advised to go early.  Having not eaten all day, we were there at 5:30.  By 6:00 the place was full and by 6:30 there was a line out the door.

Nothing fancy here.   Good food and obviously a favorite of the locals.   

I had the Peking Duck which flavor-wise was about the best I've had since Beijing.   It was cooked and spiced perfectly, but could have used a little more trimming.  Too much bone and fat left on the meat.  

The service is perfunctory.   A couple of the waiters wore headsets which pretty much says it all.   Not a place to linger, in fact there are no desserts on the menu.  Come in, enjoy some good food and leave early."
"We were fortunate enough to stay at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco and they recommended this restaurant. All I can say about it is wow! We started with the fried salmon appetizers. Even though fried, the crust was light and flaky. For the main course, we had the R & G Signature Beef dish over the best steamed rice ever. The beef was tender and flavorful and the rice was hot, but not too clumpy. Every dish coming out of the kitchen looked fabulous and we were sorry we couldn't try everything. The wait staff was impeccable and organized. Loved our visit."
"Easy stroll from omni hotel. Recommended by concierge and they were right. Great tasting genuine Chinese food ( which we've missed living in Santiago, Chile). Very busy at 8pm when we arrived. Expect a half hour wait and then very quick service to get the next punter in. As a consequence the place has a buzz. I'd recommend this place"
"For those who can dine early (5-5:30pm), no reservation will be necessary. After that, this tiny local gem gets packed!  Excellent fresh ingredients, reasonable prices for dishes meant to be shared. Pineapple shrimp fried rice was a simply prepared delight, and hot and spicy chicken with broccoli in brown bean sauce was delicious and more traditional than Americanized. Service was efficient, but a little cold to non-locals.  Quality of meals made it worth it."
"I went there because this restaurant was recommended by a lot of people.  The restaurant is not very big, tables are crowd.  I ordered the salt & pepper crab.  It’s crispy and tasty, and it’s not very greasy.  It is a must try dish.  Other dishes I had was some beef, vegetarian dish and soup.  They all are above average.  It’s a little pricy, but worth to try."
"We have been frequenting this restaurant since the 90's, when it was a somewhat crammed  basement establishment (to go to the washroom you had to walk practically through the kitchen, where you could watch with amazement the intense action going on there)  but with extremely tasty and copious food, and fair prices.  The personnel have always been a bit rush you, but hey, we went there for the food, not for the atmosphere.  

Since then it has grown both in size and pretension, becoming an overvalued tourist trap.  Yesterday we decided to give it another try, hoping it had returned to the spirit of its early days.  Unfortunately, it has departed further.  Overpriced food, with less and less ""Chinese taste"",   and served by ineffectual personnel.   Sad to see another Chinatown myth go to pot.  That's it with our patronage!"
"I chose this restaurant because I was travelling with someone who did not want to order based on what was on a dim sum cart. R&G has a full menu (with pictures), which is very helpful to those of us used to a Middle America Chinese food experience. The food, however, is nothing Middle America. It is hands-down the best Chinese food we've had. We had the hot & sour soup, cashew chicken and the kung pao prawns. Both sauces were light and non-oily. The soup was spicy without being searing hot. Everything was very fresh and expertly prepared. It was a joy not to eat Chinese food served in gloopy, oily, or syrupy sauce, overloaded with sodium."
"Some of the food was good, but not what I expected after all the hype."
"Looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant we stumbled upon this. After looking at various other sites, we felt confident about it. Now when you walk in there will a crowd of people. Feeling discouraged we left our name with the hostess and told it would be a 45 minute wait. 20 minutes later we were seated with other couples, not that we cared. Start with the calamari, absolutely the best ever! Ruined it for all other places i would get it from. I had the spicy beef also it is one of their specials. I was 2 for 2! The beer was ice cold and the service was extremely attentive. Probably because we all were wiling to sit with people we did not know. But if you try the local cuisine, you have to try this place!"
"A family member recommended this restaurant and at first the word ""lounge"" in the name threw me, but don't be fooled it is not lounge food.
The food was delicious, I had the fried crab and it was not greasy at all and easier than I thought to peel. Our other 6 entrees were also tasty. The service was good not great, but considering we were there at peak lunch hour it was adequate.  The atmosphere is high energy and it looked to be quite a few local business people dining there. We were vacationing. The presentation of the food could be improved upon, but I would rather have food which taste good rather than food that looks pretty, but not tasty."
"Came here on the evening of 6/20 at around 6:30pm (w/o a reservation) and found the place to be extremely packed.  This was no ""hole-in-the-wall"" Chinatown restaurant, this was an upscale 'fancy' place.  It was very nicely decorated and well-lit.  Anyway, we were initially ready to head elsewhere as the line at the door was pretty long.  Matter of fact, the hostess had assumed we were a party of two and told us that the wait would be at least an hour.  HOWEVER, when she finally realized that we were a party of 5, we were IMMEDIATELY given a table downstair. No waiting at all, felt kinda bad walking right past everyone to an open table, but oh well.  

What we ordered:
-Kong Xin Cai (w. Garlic): $15
-Salt and Pepper Prawns: $15
-Honey Spare Ribs: $13
-Peking Duck: $32
-Ling Cod (prepared in sauteed chives w. sprouts): $20

The entrees were pretty damn tasty.  Really good in fact.  Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely.  However, the portions were extremely small for the price paid compared to the many other restaurants in Chinatown.  If you are planning on ordering the Peking Duck, bear in mind that they do not serve the dish on those thin tortilla pancakes, they do so on those weird fluffy buns.  Also, although the duck tastes fine, they did not do as good a job carving the fat off the skin as other places I have visited (i.e. Mark Duck's House in Virginia).  Additionally, the Peking duck here still has bones in certain parts!  I'm not referring to the legs/drumsticks, I'm talking breast bones/cage!  That's just plain horrible for a classy Peking duck dish!

Being a 'fancier' restaurant in Chinatown, this place at least accepts credit cards.  Anyway, if you come here, just remember that you'll be paying more for the presentation of the dishes than at other places in Chinatown."
"Me and my husband just went to this restaurant tonight. Food was okay, not great but okay. However, if you or your members of group are black, DO NOT go to this restaurant. There are few waiters who are hating(or they are just rasist) black people.
They will give you awful, terrible service, I bet. One of the waiters throw away fork to my husband when he brought fork to our table, and so many waiters were looking at my husband very very rudely while we were eating, also everytime when they passing by our table, they put their hand on our table(we were eating!!) and flipped table cloth on purpose! We are from New York City, and traveling all over the world so We've been seeing so many rasists or people who hates asian or other races(I am asian) and some people treat me so bad but not like this restaurant. We were soooooo sad. Really sad. One of our nights of San Francisco messed up by this restaurant's rudest waiters.

I can not believe this kind of waiters are still exist in this world."
"Dining alone in a strange town is never easy.  Usually, you are guided to some small table in the corner and its an ""eat and run"" experience.  R and G offer a great counter option for lone diners like myself.  The food is really excellent - the salmon and avocado spring rolls were outstanding and the combination seafood clay pot was a great meal in itself (another great option for the single muncher).  Main drawback is the crowd that gathers in the foyer on a cool evening.  By the time I left, there were around 30 people standing in line for tables.  Everyone seemed in a good mood, but the noise and jostling was a bit uncomfortable. the staff were attentive and made some great suggestions.  I liked it a lot!"
"When we got to the restaurant it was fairly early but there was a long line waiting to get in. We had no reservations, but we were given a number and were seated in about 20 minutes. This is a family restaurant and there are large groups. The food is the best I have eaten in a long time and now I can understand why everyone wants to go there. The menu is very easy to understand and they have photos of what your meal will look like. The portions are pretty large but it is difficult not to eat it all. I had the BBQ spare ribs in honey sauce and my husband had the large prawns with steamed rice. What a treat. If I lived closer, I would be a regular customer. The staff is really super !!"
"This restaurant is highly promoted in the glossy tourist guides. In this case, it's a bad sign.  I've dined at R & G Lounge over the decades, and it's always the same.  The staff try to look professional, but their attitudes are anything but professional.  They are rough and short tempered. The food is very overpriced such as the famous crab.  And the flavours and cooking are not anything special. You can get better meals at less pretentious, less costly restaurants closeby."
"This is my favorite-favorite-favorite Chinese restaurant in San Francisco.  But you should be sure to ask the waiter what to order.  The specialties are awesome: try the salt-and-pepper crab!  The BBQ plate lunch specials are also great, and a terrific bargain.  Spicy conch, anybody?  Shredded jellyfish? BBQ duck?  Some of the non-specialties are just sort of okay.  For example, I think the hot-and-sour soup is just ordinary, and on my first visit I had some forgettable noodle dish (before I saw the BBQ lunch plates everybody else at my table was smart enough to order...)"
"So many people recommended this restaurant as the best in China Town - the Tour Guide, the hotel, trip advisor. The Tour guide ensured us that San Francisco people know good food so we took their advice. 

Please dont make the same mistake.

We read these reviews on trip advisor and take everything with a pinch of salt when the odd bad review is given but please please dont go there. We are not pretentious people, just like good food (Subway would have been better :) )

We got there and was greeted by a visit from a local tramp who decided to come in and watch the game on the TV and then luckily wandered downstairs to other tables not ours. 

We ordered the mongolian beef, chicken chow mein and chicken with black bean sauce.

The beef dish arrived 5 minutes before the rest... It was okay. The chow mein then arrived in a bowlful of grease, this was not sesame oil it was so slippery we could hardly pick it up. The Chicken dish arrived and we managed to finally get the waiteresses attention to tell her it was not the bleck bean one we ordered. She looked confused for a bit until we asked her where the black beans were in it and then she took it back to the kitchen.

5 minutes later (it cant have been freshly cooked....) the black bean dish arrived but we had ordered it non spicy and it was spicy but at that point the other dishes were eaten so we asked to just take it off the bill.

That is then the real drama started. They argued it was the spicy black bean we ordered and then the waiter started arguing that we didn't tell him in the first place we wanted it non-spicy. 

After a 5 minute argument at the till they took it off the bill and we left.

Please please dont go there and dont listen to the foody San Francisco people!...."
"On a recommendation from another traveler at our hotel, we found this resturant while venturing out in China town. Food was very good, seemed authentic (always a good sign when there are lots of locals, including other Asians eating there too!). However, we hit during the noon hour and the tables were very close to each other, not lots of room and man was it noisy! But, a great place for lunch if in Chinatown!"
"We ordered salt n' pepper Dungeness Crab ($38), a lamb dish recommended by the waiter and black bean claim.  The food quality is absolutely top notch fresh; taste is authentic with the crab been most unique.  Lychee martini was very good ($10) Atmosphere is nothing to speak of, service was good but the owner was chatting with the table behind us most of the time so I don't know if that made a difference.  Usually I'd give most Chinese restaurant service 1 or 2 stars as you go there for their food.  Anyways, great experience, highly recommended from my years of Chinese food dining experience."
"Three or four people in our hotel recommended this place telling us how great it was. Needless to say we won't ask their opinion on where to dine tomorrow night.  When we arrived we were sent to the dining area downstairs, Not to bad. We sat there for about 10 minutes before a waiter even wandered over. We debated leaving during the wait and wish we had.  My wife and I ordered a cup of hot and sour soup, I chose the Mongolian beef for my meal, she chose a chicken and broccoli dish with the sauce on the side. Our three year old son was going to share with us. We also ordered 3 waters. After about five minutes our soup came out. It was pretty good. About thirty seconds in to the soup they brought out the Mongolian Beef. Still no water. About five minutes later I asked again for water from a manager and he brought some out. Five minutes later they brought out my wife's dish, then asked if we wanted white rice. I thought that was a given in a Chinese restaurant. I asked the waiter why the Mongolian beef had zero spice, when it clearly said on the menu ""Spicy Mongolian Beef"".  He said some people don't like it spicy and I could apply the hot sauce sitting in a jar on the table that looked like it had been there for several days. Call me crazy, but a dish labeled Spicy at a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco should be ""Spicy"". My wife's dish wasn't bad, but thank goodness that brown bowl of grease they call sauce was on the side. 10 minutes later a manager came over and asked how everything was. I said ""Eh"", and she smiled and said very good and walked away. This restaurant might have passed for semi decent in a small town where they never had good Chinese food, but not for this city. Go somewhere else, in fact go anywhere else, it has to be better than this."
We ordered many dishes.  All of the dishes were terrific.  The staff even adjusted the dishes to our taste.  The staff was excellent in getting us a cab.  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.
"the service was so horrid we deliberately left a evry low tip to make a point.  THEY  ACTUALLY ALTERED OUR CHARGE RECEIPT AND ADDED $5 TO THEIR TIP!!!!!

it was a weekday lunch, and the service was abyssmal, very slow and unfriendly and simply lacking in...well, service.  the soups we started with were deliciosu!  yes, the prices are high for pretty much everything on the menu, but if we had just ordered the large soups we would have had a good meal.  as it was, we  had several dishes that all came pretty boring and bland ( and we did not order things ""not spicy."" ). 

we were so excited to hear about this restaurant.  it got raves from many locals and this site, including our  Chinese- American  friends that live in San Franciso.  i've eaten chinese food around the country, as well  Hong Kong and China, so our dislike of this place cannot be attributed to not being used to that cuisine.  where we live now decent  Chinese food is very hard to find, so we were so stoked for this meal!  it ws a total wate of a good meal out."
"My husband and I went here for a late lunch on a recent Saturday. The place was pretty packed.  Being somewhat of a picky eater (and not a bit adventurous), I had looked at the menu on line prior to going.  I went with the ""Fried Stuffed Bean Curd"" expecting firm tofu with chopped shrimp inside.  It was more like bread pudding (fried outside, custard-like inside) with shrimp flakes on top.  Perhaps that's authentic, but it was not what I wanted or expected.  My husband had the Chow Mein and really liked it.  The service was very good and the prices were reasonable.  For someone who isn't afraid to try something exotic, this would be a great spot."
"We were fairly hungry and stopped in for lunch after the concierge recommended it.  Our family of five are all small eaters.  Yet these portions were small enough that we needed to order seconds.  I prefer that to heaving dishes.  Our son ordered the R & G Special Beef and really enjoyed it.  He finished it and helped finish some other dishes that were on the table.  His twin sister is vegetarian and finally decided to try mu shu veggies.  She LOVED it!  It was not overly greasy with a pleasing mixture of veggies and a bit of egg.    Husband like the veggie one so much he ordered a mu shu pork.

The service started off inattentive and we were debating leaving and going to House of Nanking.  Then the waiter came took our order and after that anyone that came by was helpful, polite and willing to get us anything we needed.

We enjoyed our lunch and would visit again for a nice meal.  Doubt I would wait in a long line for a meal here though.  Too many other good choices in San Francisco!"
"Went to this place on recommendation of a local.Really hoped this would be a super place.We did not like the food,but that was our personal problem .But...the service was lousy.Waiter 
did not take drink order,acted rushed.When extra rice was ordered,waiter totally forgot to bring order but interstingly enough did not forget to put charge on bill.Overall,restaurant is overrated.you are better off,on finding the proverbial hole in the wall with genuine Chinese food."
"Saw this place being recommended in various guide books and over the internet as the most original place in Chinatown to have cantonese food. I can say that it lived up to the expectations but only up to a point. We didn't have the crab (didn't like the way it looked); preferred some vegetarian and salmon rolls, which were amazing, and some chicken and beef plates, which were a bit on the cold side, and finally some noodles, which were great. The flavors seemed more original than in many other places (in NY and Europe) but still westernized enough (not that this is necessarily bad). Decor was bland and service quite mediocre. Overall a nice experience."
"We went for the crab (house specialty) that we saw on the food network.  Make sure you get a reservation because the line was out the door.  We were luck enough to get the ""last crab"" as we heard our waiter telling this to the table next to us.  Strange that they would run our at 8pm?  Crab was worth it.  Very good.  Price was reasonable ($30?).  Service was the worst part.  Very poor.  Kept forgetting drinks, appetizer, etc...  Appeared to be one experienced waiter working every table with a bunch of younger ""runners"" bringing stuff out.  System did not appear to be working.  Worth trip one time to try crab, probably would not go back though."
"Our first night in San Fran we roamed around Chinatown - I remembered seeing the good reviews on TA and our hotel bellman recommended R&G - so we tried it out.  At 8pm on a Friday night there was a line out the door, standing room only in the bar and a 45 minute wait - but me, my wife & 2 teenagers decided to stick it out.  The wait was only about 30 minutes and then we were taken downstairs to be seated.  Decor was ""bland""  - but nothing special other than some fish tanks.  The service was slow and seemed rushed.  We ordered several dishes so we could try them all.  The Salt & Pepper Crab was very different.  My teenage son loved the R&G Special Beef - but the rest of us all thought that dish, as well as all the other chicken dishes we ordered were just plain bland.  We ordered the Fried Stuffed Bean Curd (knowing we would all make faces and probably not like it - but that was OK).  It didn't come to our table until we were almost done.  We told the waiter that it had come out late - and he huffed and puffed and then took it off our bill.  Overall the service was fair, the food bland, the place crowded and the price a little on the high side.  Not an aweful expereince, but next time in Chinatown we'll try somewhere else."
"Went here on the recommendation of my American daughter-in-laws mom. Well done, Mary!
We did book in advance and that was wise, the line (queue to us Brits) was enormous. We, however, we seated dead on time. Service was attentive but not overbearing - but the food was the clincher. Good, fresh food, well prepared, seasoned perfectly and looking good. You get a feeling about a restaurant from the other clientèle and I knew we'd be OK because of the number of local Chinese eating here.
Four of us ate and drank very well for a total (including tip) of $200.  Recommended."
"Visiting from east coast - this was recommended for dinner by hotel clerk who's Cantonese.  We were pleased with the food, bordering on excellent.  However, the portions were small, so don't expect your standard heaping large plates of food at your usual authentic Cantonese restaurants.  The wait can be long."
"Good food, good ambience, good location. I don't think there is scope for any improvement.
My problem with NY Chinese restaurants (the easily accessible ones not the really upscale ones, so NY lovers don't start pouncing on me) was that the food there would somehow not smell good. This place was nothing like my NY experience (as a matter of fact Chinatown at San francisco is WAYYY better than its east coast version). Loved the food, liked the chinese beer. Def recommended ...
Be warned, waiting queues can be long, plus they close by 9 or 9:30, but its well worth it .."
Haven't been in a while. Good chinese for the area
"Recommended by Tony Bourdain and did not disappoint!  I would suggest making a reservation since we tried to go on a Saturday night and the wait was long, but made it back on a Wednesday and it was well worth it!  The service was great and the food was delicious.  I would recommend the R&G special beef and their prawns with honey walnuts - most innovative Chinese food!  Love the atmosphere too."
My Chinese wife and I are very picky about Chinese restaurants - even when in China.  I can say we have never been impressed with Chinese restaurants in the U.S. regardless of what major China town we visit.  We ate at R&G 3 times and never ordered the same dishes twice.  All were great - it is real good Chinese food.
Great chinese food!  We had a bowl (they call it a bowl but could have served 6) of hot and sour soup and it was fantastic!  We also had the vegetable rolls and kung pao chicken.  All of it great!!  Highly recommend for lunch while going through Chinatown.
"Don't be fool by how packed this place is, it does not mean that the food is any good!  It's just any restaurant in China Town is full of people, simply because it's a tourist area.  The wait for a table is ridiculous, waited for 40 minutes for a table, ordered 4 dishes because the pictures look good....but they don't taste good, quite terrible actually.  The restaurant looks nice on the main level with the bar and such, but they seated us down the basement where it's stuffy and quite dirty.  We ordered peking duck, there's still bone in it....it's a wrap, how do you eat a wrap with bones inside??  We also ordered honey spare ribs, it came out thick sauce and very sweet, which is what I expected. However, the spareribs are so fatty.....you cannot even find any lean meat in it.  And oh, Do not get the ""ham hock"" dish, it's terrible and horrible....One word to describe this restaurant: Disappointing!"
"This was an outstanding dining experience.  Two promises:  you will wait a few minutes to be seated; and, you will overeat.  The chicken and cashews dish was excellent, as was the mixed seafood in a clay bowl.  The service was prompt and straightforward.  The facility is a bit worn around the edges, but clean and neat.  Our recommendation for the restaurant came from a local who eats there frequently."
"I really enjoyed this Chinese restaurant. My mom and I went to SF for Thanksgiving and walked from Union Square to this restaurant for dinner. It was very good. I live in California's Central Valley where there are lots of Mexican immigrant families. We always can tell a good Mexican restaurant when there are Mexican citizens eating there. I felt the same way about this Chinese restaurant. 

It was good food and we were seated right away, despite it being VERY busy. The salt and pepper crab is a must-try. I am not a seafood eater, but I gave it a shot and it was delicious. I noticed all the tables around had ordered it too."
Very decent restaurant - they do serve Shark's Fin Soup which is outrageous however.
"The Concierge at our Hotel recommended this  Restaurant.  Reasonably priced, excellent service.  Food was good.  Mostly locals . 
I would recommend."
"We wandered around SF looking for dinner one night late July looking for a restaurant.  We recalled R&G after passing it the night before and saw a local patron in a fairly nice car bring out to-go packages.  Seeing this, we assumed this restaurant should be tried.

There was about a 45 minute wait, so we made our way to the bar on this busy Saturday night.  The stand-in for the bartender was the owner's son.  He was very friendly and made fairly decent drinks.  We kept ourselves entertained by guessing what ""R&G"" stood for.  

We were seated in the lower level.  The crab entree was delightful, considering I'm not much of a crab fan.  The portion was plentiful.  The waitstaff was efficient.  

Everything was great and would go back here again.  Funny that the following week Anthony Bourdain made a stop here in his SF episode."
"Staying on the outskirts of Chinatown, we were keen to have some decent Chinese.  The hotel recommended R & G Lounge with the caveat that it was not fine dining.  Perfect.  It did not disappoint.  It has that typical no no-nonsence decoration that Chinese restaurants often do.  I miss the old fashioned kitsch a little.  It is very busy, with diners spread over three levels.

We asked for recommendations and without checking prices, were a little concerned we'd be hit with a massive bill for mainly seafood selection.  That worry was unfounded.  The food was very good, plentiful and was not expensive.  Service is friendly and efficient.  They obviously do a huge turnover, but handle it all very professionally."
"My husband, two teenagers and I  were looking for place to eat in San Francisco's Chinatown.  As it is a touristy area, we had heard some restaurants were overpriced with bad food.  So, we went into the Chinatown branch of the San Francisco Public Library and asked for recommendations.  We were directed to the R & G Lounge.  Although not a budget restaurant, I have never had such excellent Chinese food!  The waiter was helpful, friendly and offered us suggestions when we were ordering two dishes that were very similar.  Even though we were in shorts and t-shirts, which was a bit casual for this restaurant, we were not made to feel under dressed.  We are from Seattle and have access to a wide variety of Asian cuisine and this was by far the best Chinese food we have EVER had!  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!"
"Don't go here for lunch, thinking you'll save a few bucks.  We tried that and were sorely disappointed.  Lunch specials are very weak creations.  Oxtails were a half a plate of bones with a mountain of rice..  Noodle dishes were lots of noodles, very little meat or veggies.  There are lots of restaurants in Chinatown.  I'm sure most are better for lunch than R&G.  Don't know about diinner except that prices are high.  And if the kitchen turns out crap for lunch, how good could they be for dinner?"
"We would have never come here except for the recommendation of our B&B.  The name does not say Chinese, the appearance from the outside does not say Chinese, but the food was wonderful.  Upstairs is for reservations, but downstairs is communal dining.  We were waiting for our table when we kept seeing people going down the stairs.  Finally we asked and were told that if we wanted communal dining (sitting at tables with others) we could go on down.  We did this and enjoyed the experience.  Most of the people at our table were not talking to us, but amongst themselves, which was fine.  The food came out each one individually.  Unfortunately the young lady (who was there before us) ordered the same thing as I did.  When the waiter came, he asked who ordered the cashew chicken and I said that I did.  He gave me the plate and I began eating.  I did not realize that the other young lady did not have any food and she did not speak up - only to the waiter to complain that I accidentally got her food.  Hers was brought out shortly and all was fine.  It was excellent food.  Very fresh and good size portions.  Mostly locals there and a few tourists.  It was great."
"Famous with their signature dish, salt and pepper crab, go only if you haven't tried it at least once. The crab is big for 2 people with medium appetite, after a while, the salt begins to sting my lips, so drink lotsa water! Beer is a good companion.

Wait time can be terrible, check with the lady hostess, she will tell you what is the min wait time. Waiting area is very jam packed, we were there on a weekend. Ambience is so-so, we got a place downstairs facing the kitchen! 

If you expect quiet and privacy during weekend, not recommended."
"My husband and I went for a lovely Saturday night dinner. In the middle of the specialties of crab and Peking duck, a four-inch cockroach walked across my arm. To avoid what I experienced, find any of the dozens of other equally well-reviewed restaurants in Chinatown. Bugs in the dining room speak poorly for cleanliness in the kitchen. I will not go back."
"I was very upset when I found out that Shark Fin Soup was on the menu.  I should have got up and left that moment, but I didn't.  Regardless, I feel terrible that I didn't leave.  After watching the movie SharkWater, I've become very passionate about saving sharks and educating friends about the movie.  Thousands of sharks are killed only for their fins and thrown back into the water to drown.  We need sharks in our ecosystem to survive.  One very important way is to not order Shark Fin Soup or even better, not support restaurants that have it on the menu.  I have written a letter to the restaurant asking them to remove the item from their menu."
One of the nicest chinese restaurant in c-town.  It's not cheap and the portions aren't huge but everything's pretty tasty.
"i was determined not to get suckd into some prix fixe valentine's day dinner so i chose r & g lounge.  we had a reservationa dn were seatly immediately.  first off, the service was non existent.  it took them forever to take our order, then they brought the food out sparactically, forgot our drinks, etc.  didn't matter.  the salt & pepper crab and the house special beef made me forgive and forget.  the crab was huge and extremely messy but one of the most delicious things ever!"
"Not bad, pleasantly surprised."
"Good value, fast service.  Chow fun is flavorful.  Ask for seafood chow fun.  Its not on the menu but they will make it for you."
"The R&G Lounge was recommended by the bartender at our hotel.  He said it was really good....so we took his advice. 

First, something positive. The food was good...but not anything special.  

However, the service we received by our waiter ranks as the worst I have ever experienced. Once seated, it took quite a long time for anything to take our order. We started with drinks (wine for me, mixed cocktail for my husband). My wine arrived...but my husbands drink did not arrive until I had almost finished my wine. And we had to flag down our waiter to ask about his drink before it was even delivered. 

For our meal, we each ordered an entree and a shared serving of stir-fried rice.  The rice never arrived.  My husbands entree was delivered long before mine.   

But here's the kicker. I also ordered a cup of soup that was ""advertised"" on the first page of the menu and was listed at $5. My husband did not order any for himself, however. The soup that was delivered was in an enormous ""communal"" bowl that could easily feed 4 to 6 people. Of coarse, I was somewhat confused...but was never able to get the attention of our waiter to ask why such a large ""tub"" of soup had been delivered to our table. Therefore, I took only one cup for myself....as I had ordered. And my husband did not take any.  

When our bill arrived, the rice that was never delivered was on our bill and had to be removed. In addition, the price of the soup was a whopping $14 (not the $5 that was outlined in the menu).  My husband pointed out that I had ordered only a cup of soup for $5, the waiter responded ""well, that's not what we brought to you""...and walked away. Our waiter: 
1. Had no desire to help us in any way. 
2. Could have cared less about us as customers. 

I will never, EVER return this this restaurant and highly recommend that EVERYONE think twice before visiting R&G Lounge. 
Probably the worst dining experience of my life."
"The concierge at my hotel recommended this restaurant as ""authentic"" and ""upscale"".  Authentic might be true, as the restaurant was full of people ordering in cantonese, but it is more of a restaurant for a Wednesday night quick simple meal than a night out on the town with clients you are trying to impress.   

The decor is Early American dive - flimsy tables and chairs pushed together in the dining room, white ""paper"" tablecloths.  The tables are equipped with a condiment caddy (including red pepper sauce) and a pot of steaming hot tea in a mass-manufactured teapot.  Serviceable but not elegant.  (the tea was good, though.)

The cuisine is Cantonese and simple.  The eggrolls we ordered tasted fine, if a little greasy.  The mixed vegetables entree was full of fresh vegetables with a slightly sweet sauce - it was good, but not spectacular.  Service was quick and friendly.   The meal price for three people was $80.00, including tax and tip; not too expensive for a SF restaurant but a little high for what you get.  The Cantonese take-out place in my neighborhood has similar food for less - full meals for three people from there rarely top $35.00.

Overall, the experience was fine but a little pricey for what we received.  I'd probably go back...on a weeknight...in jeans."
"Upon a firm recommendation from a Long Island , NY couple,  we went here for lunch. We were advised to order the dungeness crab which we did-steamed with garlic. Four of us shared it and it was delicious. However, it was all downhill from there. The noodle soup was tasteless-the broth tasted like boiled water. The Peking duck was the worst I've ever had. Served with 6 dumplings, it was full of fat and bones, no meat at all. Fried tofu was flavorless as was the shrimp chow mein. It took about 20 min. to see a server and the food came out quickly. The restrooms are very dirty. It makes me wonder what the kitchens look like. There are so many restaurants in Chinatown. Take my advise and go elsewhere."
"Gotta love that fried pepper crab, Sea bass and red bean dessert soup. Yum."
"LONG lines, but good contemporary food. Prob one of the best places in Chinatown area for Chinese food. Silky tofu was good, Satay Beef Noodles were GREAT"
"After reading numerous good reviews of this restaurant on Tripadvisor and Frommer's we had high expectations of this place. However, we found our meals to be below average and the service to be perfunctory. The ""chicken w/ cashews"" dish was overly salty and otherwise lacked flavor."
"We went to the R&G - it's recommended in Fodor's and was near our hotel.  We had to wait, but only about 15 minutes, which was a surprise since we were told, when we walked in, it would be about a half hour.

Food:  We ordered the eggroll, a chow mein, and the house special beef.  The beef was quite good, the rest was of our food was good, but I wouldn't say outstanding.  Many diners around us had ordered the fried crab, which looked appetizing.

Service:  Our waiter did speak some English, but the busboys spoke none at all.  This was inconvenient, since our waiter wasn't readily available (he also did not look like he was happy working there.).  We didn't get the bowl of rice we ordered, but it didn't show up on our bill, either.  I felt like we were being rushed at the end... the female maitre'd/supervisor gave us the check, and as soon as I took out my credit card, she literally grabbed the credit card out of my hand.

By the time we left, around 8 pm, there were throngs of people on the sidewalk waiting..

The R&G is an okay option for Chinatown, but I would explore other options before going back there."

"Great food, average service. This place can be very crowded.  Lunch specials start at $6.  This is the best place to eat in Chinatown."
Good Chinese food but fairly pricey. Liked their spare ribs and princess chicken.
"Our service on Monday, June 30th was poor - no ice water arrived until the end of our meal, even though we requested it twice.   Never received any sweetener.  The worst was that the meat in our Peking Duck was gristly and fatty, practically inedible - the worst Peking Duck we've ever had."
"waiter a jerk, food good. would give it another try. don't get jason as waiter."
Very good roasted duck and steamed fish.
"Can be loud at times (but hey, what Chinese restaurant isn't?), but they've got the best 'salt pepper crab' (signature dish). It's lightly coated with a batter and deep fried to perfection! You'll want to eat the coating on the shells and leave the crab meat that it's so good. Also reccommend the sea food lettuce cups as a great appetizer. Avoid tables located at the ground floor as traffic can be distracting (ask for a table either upstairs - slightly more upscale or downstairs - can be claustrophobic at times)."
"When we arrived we discovered they had lost our reservation so reluctantly we waited an hour to be seated.
Once seated, the service was quick, but not too quick and very friendly, something that is rare in such a busy place.  The food was fresh, well presented and tasted great.  The portions were just right."
"We ate here twice during our March 2008 trip to San Francisco.  Both times were packed- reservations recommended, even if you call an hour before you arrive it helps.  The food was terrific, prices are reasonable, the place is immaculate and service was very good.  We highly recommend this, talked to many locals who favor this place and loved the photo of Jackie Chan on the wall- what an endorsement!  Highly recommended!"
"One needs a good sized group to sample the menu in a place like this. My order of three dishes without the signature items was not enough. That said, the items that I had were of variable quality. 

West Lake Minced Beef Soup - well balanced broth with ground beef, parsley, egg whites, and imitation crabmeat. Delicious dish. I am not a fan of imitation crab, but this was a nice start to the meal.

Drunken Squab - traditional cold dish, with disassembled and reassembled naked squab complete with head, presented in a pool of rice wine. The squab was tender, but the wine was a bit harsh and the dish lacked complexity. Not to my taste.

Dried Scallops with Chinese Melons - this dish was described on the menu as steamed chinese melons, black fungus, and seasonal greens topped with dried scallop gravy. The dish that arrived had no black fungus. When I inquired, the waiter explained that the kitchen had run out.  The dish was very good even without a key ingredient,  but it would have been nice to be informed in advance. This seemed like an inadvertent error. 

Dessert -- The waiter brought a nice bowl of sweet bean soup.

Service - reasonably attentive and friendly. Waiters took the time to explain the elements of dishes and the high market prices of the live seafood to folks at an adjacent table. This was during a slow part of the day.

Clientele - an odd mixture of tourists clutching Foder's while timidly ordering the signature salt-and-pepper crab and locals ordering off menu in Mandarin.   With benefit of hindsight, I would have been better off ordering like either the tourists or the locals. 

Bottom line - My initial impression was mixed. I have had better meals  in Taipei, Singapore, San Gabriel, Hong Kong (of course), and even in Tokyo, Philly and Boston.  But the glowing reviews on this site and the smiling faces of diners suggest that my experience may have been atypical.   I will try this restaurant again with different orders."
Hong Kong style Chinese food!  Kung Hei Fat Choyyyy!  88.
"Best for great Chinese food at an affordable price. Recently remodeled and added upstairs, plus more seating for dining on the first floor (the bar is there) Great for groups like conventioneers and the like! Great atmosphere!"
"Great Chinese food, clean, lots of special dishes especially the Ling Nan Beef..."

This restaurant is absolutely fabulous!  It was recommended by a cabbie to us 11 years ago and every time we are in SF we have to stop in and have their 'Special Beef'.

It is casual and family friendly.  Once we were there with 10+ family members and had a huge table with a lazy susan in the middle and we ordered family style and everyone got to enjoy a taste of everything.  

They even have a live fish/lobster tank."
Great Chinese Food!  More on the heavy side nevertheless very yummy!
Worth the stop if don't want to venture into Chinatown.
Good food that's not your everyday Chinatown trash-food.  Actually could enter a mouth and go down the throat. But very expensive. Not exactly worth the money.
Their feature fried crab is superb. Most of the menu tastes really good. The prices however are a tad too high.
"Expensive, but good food (even if you have to crack the crab shell with your teeth)."
Great lunch spot
"For me, R&G is the best Chinese restaurant in SF. Must try dish is the grill cod. It's melt in your mouth."
one of the prestigious restaurant over the bay area.It is famous for salt and pepper crab.
"salt-pepper fried crab, so good"
not bad but not cheap. I guess you get what you paid for
"Best Chinese food I've had in San Francisco.  A nice place for a business or family sit down dinner with delicious food, good service and cleanliness."
"Great Chinese, if you dont mind hoofing it to China Town."
"Baked cod fish, salt & pepper shrimp ~~~~~yummy~~~~~"
"This place was the best Chinese food that I have ever had. I have been to many Chinese restaurants but this one definitely tops them all. We first ordered the BBQ pork and the egg rolls. The Pork was tender and flavorful. The eggrolls were crispy and tasted delicious. We then had the walnut shrimp and the specialty beef plate. First of all normally at other restaurants you would get these tiny shrimp, here a plate full of jumbo shrimp came out, usually there is too much mayo in this dish but this was lightly toasted and sweet. The beef plate was so tender I was able to cut the beef with my fork, no fat just fantastic. The waiters were incredibly attentive and nice. This is a must eat restaurant if you love Chinese food."
GREAT Chinese food in china town.Eat where the locals eat .
"We were on vacation and family members who live in SF recommended we go to R&G.  We definitely enjoyed the dinner.  Though the crab was VERY expensive you have to get it as it is their signature dish.  The rest of the entrees are much more reasonably priced and all tasted very good.  Also, when you go you should make reservations as they do get very busy and I'm told you should ask to be seated in the upstairs dining area.  I did not see the lower level dining but heard it is not as nice.  They did get pretty obvious when they needed us to leave as different people kept coming by and asking if we needed anything else.  We were meeting family for dinner and wanted to catch up more so didn't leave right away.  We were a little annoyed with this, thus the above average vs. excellent rating."
"Went for lunch on the recommendation of ""Best of SF for 2007"".  The place is very clean and their service is typical NY Chinatown.... quick and very , impersonal.  It's all about the food so don't take it personal.

Lots of Chinese people in the place so you know it's going to be at least good.  We had their ""famous"" salt and pepper crab and it was real good folkes.  The seasoning was amazing.  Little bits and pieces of garlic, Chinese 5 spice, etc.  It's huge and priced at market; our's was $30.  You do need to work at this dish.  They give you the appropriate tools.  Lots of shells to crack.

We also tried their fried rice and that too was very good.  A bit different from NYC's version in that they use shredded lettuce rather than bean sprouts, but it was still very, very good. 

Just wish we had ordered more dishes, however we were saving room for dinner at some Italian restaurant..  A dinner that proved very disappointing. 

In any case, you definitely want to go to this place, if you also like NYC's Chinatown restaurants.  This place is the real deal."
My husband & I agree that R&G has the best Chinese food that we have ever tasted!!!  We will eat there every time we visit San Francisco.
"Worst place to go to in terms of Service. ME and my husband decided ..this is not a place we ever would want to go again. We reached there for lunch one day at 2:27. Well may be by the time the waiter came to us to take orders it was 2:31, but he refused 2 dishes saying 'i can't give that to your after 2:30'. Duh ..! 
The soup we ordered was nice though...but not exceptional..can get it in other good chinese places.
Our total bill came upto $24.30 and including tips came to $29.00. And when we asked a waiter where to validate our parking tickets, he says ' Sorry validation only for orders more than $25.00 before tips' and he walked away. We were totally taken aback.
I have not seen a worser service and attitude elsewhere..and we enjoy a lot of cusines and look for good restaurants. This one will NOT feature in our 'last resort' list either."
"Flawless preparations.  Tried dishes that were fried, stir fried, and braised.  All were perfect.  Skipped the pricey crabs for budget reasons."
"Restaurant provides decent chinese food at a very reasonable price.  We didn't have the speciality crab dishes which lots of people seemed to be eating . 

One good sign was that there were lots of chinese people eating there."
This is the only restaurant to go to in Chinatown! Make sure to have the salt and pepper crab- there is absoluntely nothing better in the entire city!!! Every dish I've had has been stellar.
"R&G Lounge is more expensive than neighborhood Chinatown restaurants, but it looks much cleaner and nicer (you're paying for the ambiance). Actually, it's reasonably priced, just not bargain-basement cheap. 

The Special beef in XO sauce is very good, Walnut prawns and stuffed tofu are good, too.  Several friends liked this restaurant as well."
"Welcome to Asian that is a little cold.
But the dishes are remarkable and of excellent quality and quantity.
We recommend,Merci pour votre avis ! Nous nous excusons pour l'accueil froid, nous allons en discuter avec le personnel. Nous espérons que vous reviendrez nous voir la prochaine fois que vous serez dans notre quartier ! Lucy - Captain - info@rnglounge.com"
"A fairly odorless and flavorless welcome, hence the Rating of 4 stars.
Regarding the dishes, nothing to say, it’s really very good, I Trip Tip a dish for two, because the shares are so dantesque.
Desserts have no interest.
This restaurant is right in the center of Chinatown,Merci pour votre commentaire honnête ! Nous sommes désolés que notre nourriture ne soit pas à la hauteur, mais nous espérons que vous reviendrez pour un autre plat du menu la prochaine fois que vous serez dans notre quartier. Merci !

"The food is very good, the service is slow and confusing but it is worth knowing and trying this place, the drinks are very strong cocktails."
